{"cik": "1650132", "company": "Four Corners Property Trust, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-22", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nVarious risks and uncertainties could affect our business. Any of the risks described below or elsewhere in this report or our other filings with the SEC could have a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. It is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe are dependent on Darden to make payments to us and fulfill its obligations under the Leases, as well as to provide services to us under the Transition Services Agreement and the Franchise Agreements, and an event that materially and adversely affects Darden\u2019s business, financial position or results of operations could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position or results of operations.\nCurrently, Darden is the only lessee under the Leases and, therefore, is the source of substantially all of our revenues. Additionally, because the Leases are triple-net leases, we depend on Darden to pay all insurance, taxes, utilities, common area maintenance charges, maintenance and repair expenses and to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims, litigation and liabilities arising in connection with its business. There can be no assurance that Darden will have sufficient assets, income and access to financing to enable it to satisfy its payment obligations to us under the Leases. The inability or unwillingness of Darden to meet its rent obligations to us under any of the Leases could materially adversely affect our business, financial position or results of operations, including our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders as required to maintain our status as a REIT. The inability of Darden to satisfy its other obligations under the Leases, such as the payment of insurance, taxes and utilities could materially and adversely affect the condition of the Properties. In addition, the failure of Darden or any future tenant to fulfill its maintenance obligations may cause us to incur significant and unexpected expenses to remediate any resulting damage to the property. Furthermore, the failure by Darden or any future tenant to adequately maintain a leased property could adversely affect our ability to timely re-lease the property to a new tenant or otherwise monetize our investment in the property if we are forced to make significant repairs or changes to the property as a result of the tenant\u2019s neglect. If we incur significant additional expenses or are delayed in being able to pursue returns on our real estate investments, it may have a materially adverse effect on our ability to operate and grow our business and our ability to achieve our strategic objectives.\nSince Darden Restaurants, Inc. is a holding company, it is dependent to an extent on distributions from its direct and indirect subsidiaries in order to satisfy the payment obligations under the Leases, and the ability of Darden to make such distributions may be adversely impacted in the event of the insolvency or bankruptcy of such entities or by covenants in its debt agreements or otherwise that restrict the amount of the distributions that may be made by such entities. For these reasons, if Darden were to experience a material and adverse effect on its business, financial position or results of operations, our business, financial position or results of operations could also be materially and adversely affected.\nDue to our dependence on rental payments from Darden as our primary source of revenues, we may be limited in our ability to enforce our rights under, or to terminate, the Leases. Failure by Darden to comply with the terms of the Leases could require us to find other lessees for some or all of the properties and there could be a decrease or cessation of rental payments by Darden.\nThere is no assurance that we would be able to lease any of the Properties to other lessees on substantially equivalent or better terms than any of the Leases with Darden, or at all, successfully reposition the Properties for other uses or sell the Properties on terms that are favorable to us. It may be more difficult to find a replacement tenant for a restaurant or retail property than it would be to find a replacement tenant for a general commercial property due to the specialized nature of the business.\nAlso, due to our status as a new publicly traded company, we will depend on certain transition services to be provided by Darden under the Transition Services Agreement in order to successfully operate our business as we become accustomed to operating as an independent, stand-alone entity. If for any of the reasons stated above Darden becomes unable or unwilling to provide these transition services, our business, financial position or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nIn addition, our operation of the Kerrow Restaurant Operating Business depends on the provision of services to us by Darden pursuant to the Franchise Agreements. The Franchise Agreements provide that Darden agrees to provide certain franchising services to our subsidiary, Kerrow. The franchising services include licensing the right to use and display certain trademarks, utilize trade\nsecrets and purchase proprietary products from Darden in connection with the operation of the Kerrow Restaurant Operating Business. Other services provided pursuant to the Franchise Agreements are marketing services, training and access to certain LongHorn operating procedures. The Franchise Agreements also contain provisions under which Darden may provide certain technical support for the Kerrow Restaurant Operating Business.\nThe risk factor immediately below describes certain risks that may impact the performance of Darden. Additional risks relating to Darden\u2019s business can be found in Darden\u2019s public filings with the SEC. You can get copies of these public filings, for free on Darden\u2019s website, www.darden.com. Darden\u2019s SEC filings are also available to be read or copied at the SEC\u2019s public reference room, located at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. Information regarding the operation of the public reference room can be obtained by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. Darden\u2019s filings can also be obtained for free on the SEC\u2019s Internet website at www.sec.gov. We are providing Darden\u2019s website address solely for the information of investors. We do not intend Darden\u2019s website to be an active link or to otherwise incorporate the information contained on Darden\u2019s website into this report or other filings with the SEC.\nWe are dependent on Darden successfully operating its business, and a failure do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations. Therefore, we are subject to factors which affect the performance of Darden.\nCurrently, Darden constitutes our entire tenant base. As a result, we are dependent on Darden successfully operating its business and fulfilling the obligations that it owes to us. The ability of Darden to fulfill the obligations that it owes to us depends, in part, on the overall performance and profitability of Darden. Factors which may impact the business, financial position or results of operations of Darden include the following:\n\u2022\nfood safety and food-borne illness concerns throughout the supply chain; health concerns arising from food-related pandemics, outbreaks of flu viruses or other diseases;\n\u2022\nlitigation, including allegations of illegal, unfair or inconsistent employment practices;\n\u2022\nunfavorable publicity, or a failure to respond effectively to adverse publicity;\n\u2022\nlabor and insurance costs;\n\u2022\ninsufficient guest or employee facing technology, or a failure to maintain a continuous and secure cyber network, free from material failure, interruption or security breach;\n\u2022\nDarden\u2019s inability or failure to execute a comprehensive business continuity plan following a major natural disaster such as a hurricane or man-made disaster, including terrorism;\n\u2022\nDarden\u2019s failure to drive both short-term and long-term profitable sales growth through brand relevance, operating excellence, opening new restaurants of existing brands and developing or acquiring new dining brands;\n\u2022\na lack of suitable new restaurant locations or a decline in the quality of the locations of Darden\u2019s current restaurants;\n\u2022\na failure to identify and execute innovative marketing and guest relationship tactics and ineffective or improper use of social media or other marketing initiatives; an inability or failure to recognize, respond to and effectively manage the accelerated impact of social media;\n\u2022\na failure to address cost pressures, including rising costs for commodities, health care and utilities used by Darden\u2019s restaurants, and a failure to effectively deliver cost management activities and achieve economies of scale in purchasing;\n\u2022\nthe impact of shortages or interruptions in the delivery of food and other products from third-party vendors and suppliers;\n\u2022\ndisruptions in the financial markets that may impact consumer spending patterns, affect the availability and cost of credit and increase pension plan expenses;\n\u2022\neconomic and business factors specific to the restaurant industry and other general macroeconomic factors including energy prices and interest rates that are largely out of Darden\u2019s control; and\n\u2022\na failure of Darden\u2019s internal controls over financial reporting and future changes in accounting standards.\nA significant majority of our restaurant properties are Olive Garden properties. Therefore, we are subject to risks associated with having a highly concentrated property brand base.\nCurrently, our initial restaurant properties include 300 Olive Garden restaurants. As a result, our success, at least in the short-term, is dependent on the continued success of the Olive Garden brand and, to a lesser extent, its other restaurant brands. We believe that building brand value is critical to increasing demand and building customer loyalty. Consequently, if market recognition or the positive perception of the Olive Garden or other Darden brands is reduced or compromised, the value associated with Olive Garden or other Darden-branded properties in our portfolio may be adversely affected.\nWe intend to pursue acquisitions of additional properties and seek other strategic opportunities, which may result in the use of a significant amount of management resources or significant costs, and we may not fully realize the potential benefits of such transactions.\nWe intend to pursue acquisitions of additional properties and seek acquisitions and other strategic opportunities, including, but not limited to, expanding our tenant base to third parties other than Darden. Accordingly, we may often be engaged in evaluating potential transactions, potential new tenants and other strategic alternatives. In addition, from time to time, we may engage in discussions that may result in one or more transactions. Although there is uncertainty that any of these discussions will result in definitive agreements or the completion of any transaction, we may devote a significant amount of our management resources to such a transaction, which could negatively impact our operations. We may incur significant costs in connection with seeking acquisitions or other strategic opportunities regardless of whether the transaction is completed and in combining our operations if such a transaction is completed. In the event that we consummate an acquisition or strategic alternative in the future, there is no assurance that we would fully realize the potential benefits of such a transaction.\nWe operate in a highly competitive market and face competition from other REITs, investment companies, private equity and hedge fund investors, sovereign funds, restaurant and retail operators, lenders and other investors, some of whom are significantly larger and have greater resources and lower costs of capital. Increased competition will make it more challenging to identify and successfully capitalize on acquisition opportunities that meet our investment objectives. Our board of directors may change our investment objectives at any time without stockholder approval. If we cannot identify and purchase a sufficient quantity of suitable properties at favorable prices or if we are unable to finance acquisitions on commercially favorable terms, our business, financial position or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Additionally, the fact that we must distribute 90% of our net taxable income in order to maintain our qualification as a REIT may limit our ability to rely upon rental payments from our leased properties or subsequently acquired properties in order to finance acquisitions and other strategic opportunities. As a result, if debt or equity financing is not available on acceptable terms, our ability to pursue further acquisitions might be limited or curtailed.\nAcquisitions of properties we might seek to acquire entail risks associated with real estate investments generally, including that the investment\u2019s performance will fail to meet expectations or that the tenant, operator or manager will underperform.\nOur level of indebtedness could materially and adversely affect our financial position, including reducing funds available for other business purposes and reducing our operational flexibility, and we may have future capital needs and may not be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms.\nWe have entered into a credit agreement providing for $400.0 million in a term loan due in November 2020 and a revolving credit facility with an available facility amount through November 2019 in an aggregate principal amount of $350.0 million, each of which are provided by a syndicate of banks and other financial institutions. The term loan facility is fully drawn and the revolving credit facility was undrawn at December 31, 2015. We may incur additional indebtedness in the future to refinance our existing indebtedness, to finance newly-acquired assets or for other purposes. Our governing documents do not contain any limitations on the amount of debt we may incur and we do not have a formal policy limiting the amount of debt we may incur in the future. Subject to the restrictions, if any, set forth in our debt agreements, our board of directors may establish and change our leverage policy at any time without stockholder approval. Any significant additional indebtedness could require a substantial portion of our cash flow to make interest and principal payments due on our indebtedness. Greater demands on our cash resources may reduce funds available to us to pay dividends, make capital expenditures and acquisitions, or carry out other aspects of our business strategy. Increased indebtedness can also limit our ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions, make us more vulnerable\nto general adverse economic and industry conditions and create competitive disadvantages for us compared to other companies with relatively lower debt levels. Increased future debt service obligations may limit our operational flexibility, including our ability to acquire assets, finance or refinance our assets, contribute assets to joint ventures or sell assets as needed.\nMoreover, our ability to obtain additional financing and satisfy our financial obligations under our indebtedness outstanding from time to time will depend upon our future operating performance, which is subject to then prevailing general economic and credit market conditions, including interest rate levels and the availability of credit generally, and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. A worsening of credit market conditions could materially and adversely affect our ability to obtain financing on favorable terms, if at all.\nWe also may be unable to obtain additional financing or financing on favorable terms or our operating cash flow may be insufficient to satisfy our financial obligations under our indebtedness outstanding from time to time. Among other things, the absence of an investment grade credit rating or any credit rating downgrade could increase our financing costs and could limit our access to financing sources. If financing is not available when needed, or is available on unfavorable terms, we may be unable to complete acquisitions or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCovenants in our debt agreements may limit our operational flexibility, and a covenant breach or default could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position or results of operations.\nThe agreements governing our indebtedness contain customary covenants that may limit our operational flexibility. The credit agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the incurrence of debt, the incurrence of secured debt, the ability of Four Corners OP and the guarantors to enter into mergers, consolidations, sales of assets and similar transactions, limitations on distributions and other restricted payments, and limitations on transactions with affiliates and customary reporting obligations.\nIn addition, we are required to comply with the following financial covenants: (1) total indebtedness to consolidated capitalization value not to exceed 60%; (2) mortgage-secured leverage ratio not to exceed 40%; (3) total secured recourse indebtedness not to exceed 5% of consolidated capitalization value; (4) minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.75 to 1.00; (5) minimum consolidated tangible net worth; (6) unhedged floating rate debt not to exceed 50% of all indebtedness; (7) maximum unencumbered leverage ratio not to exceed 60%; and (8) minimum unencumbered debt service coverage ratio of 1.50 to 1.00.\nThe credit agreement contains customary events of default including, without limitation, payment defaults, violation of covenants and other performance defaults, defaults on payment of indebtedness and monetary obligations, bankruptcy-related defaults, judgment defaults, REIT status default and the occurrence of certain change of control events. Breaches of certain covenants may result in defaults and cross-defaults under certain of our other indebtedness, even if we satisfy our payment obligations to the respective obligee.\nCovenants that limit our operational flexibility, as well as covenant breaches or defaults under our debt instruments, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position or results of operations, or our ability to incur additional indebtedness or refinance existing indebtedness.\nAn increase in market interest rates could increase our interest costs on existing and future debt and could adversely affect our stock price, and a decrease in market interest rates could lead to additional competition for the acquisition of real estate, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nIf interest rates increase, so could our interest costs for any new debt and our variable rate debt obligations pursuant to the credit agreement. This increased cost could make the financing of any acquisition more expensive as well as lower our current period earnings. Rising interest rates could limit our ability to refinance existing debt when it matures or cause us to pay higher interest rates upon refinancing. In addition, an increase in interest rates could decrease the access third parties have to credit, thereby decreasing the amount they are willing to pay to lease our assets and consequently limiting our ability to reposition our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions. Furthermore, the dividend yield on our common stock, as a percentage of the price of such common stock, will influence the price of such common stock. Thus, an increase in market interest rates may lead prospective purchasers of our common stock to expect a higher dividend yield, which could adversely\naffect the market price of our common stock. In addition, decreases in interest rates may lead to additional competition for the acquisition of real estate due to a reduction in desirable alternative income-producing investments. Increased competition for the acquisition of real estate may lead to a decrease in the yields on real estate we have targeted for acquisition. In such circumstances, if we are not able to offset the decrease in yields by obtaining lower interest costs on our borrowings, our results of operations will be adversely affected.\nHedging transactions could have a negative effect on our results of operations.\nWe have entered into hedging transactions with respect to interest rate exposure on our term loan and we may enter into other hedging transactions, with respect to one or more of our assets or other liabilities. The use of hedging transactions involves certain risks, including: (1) the possibility that the market will move in a manner or direction that would have resulted in a gain for us had a hedging transaction not been used, in which case our performance would have been better had we not engaged in the hedging transaction; (2) the risk of an imperfect correlation between the risk sought to be hedged and the hedging transaction used; (3) the potential illiquidity for the hedging instrument used, which may make it difficult for us to close out or unwind a hedging transaction; (4) the possibility that our counterparty fails to honor its obligations; and (5) the possibility that we may have to post collateral to enter into hedging transactions, which we may lose if we are unable to honor our obligations. Our election to be subject to tax as a REIT will also result in limitations on our income sources, and the hedging strategies available to us will be more limited than those available to companies that are not REITs.\nOur pursuit of investments in, and acquisitions or development of, additional properties may be unsuccessful or fail to meet our expectations.\nInvestments in and acquisitions of restaurant and retail properties and other properties we might seek to acquire entail risks associated with real estate investments generally, including that the investment\u2019s performance will fail to meet expectations, that the cost estimates for necessary property improvements will prove inaccurate or that the tenant, operator or manager will underperform. Real estate development projects present other risks, including construction delays or cost overruns that increase expenses, the inability to obtain required zoning, occupancy and other governmental approvals and permits on a timely basis, and the incurrence of significant development costs prior to completion of the project.\nOur charter restricts the ownership and transfer of our outstanding stock, which may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or change of control of our company.\nIn order for us to qualify as a REIT, not more than 50% in value of our outstanding shares of stock may be owned, beneficially or constructively, by five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of each taxable year after the first year for which we elect to be subject to tax and qualify as a REIT. Additionally, at least 100 persons must beneficially own our stock during at least 335 days of a taxable year (other than the first taxable year for which we elect to be subject to tax and qualify as a REIT). Our charter, with certain exceptions, authorizes our board of directors to take such actions as are necessary or advisable to preserve our qualification as a REIT. Our charter also provides that, unless exempted by the board of directors, no person may own more than 9.8% in value or in number, whichever is more restrictive, of the outstanding shares of our common stock or more than 9.8% in value of the aggregate of the outstanding shares of all classes and series of our stock. The constructive ownership rules are complex and may cause shares of stock owned directly or constructively by a group of related individuals or entities to be constructively owned by one individual or entity. These ownership limits could delay or prevent a transaction or a change in control of us that might involve a premium price for shares of our stock or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders. The acquisition of less than 9.8% of our outstanding stock by an individual or entity could cause that individual or entity to own constructively in excess of 9.8% in value of our outstanding stock, and thus violate our charter\u2019s ownership limit. Our charter also prohibits any person from owning shares of our stock that would result in our being \u201cclosely held\u201d under Section 856(h) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d) or otherwise cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT. In addition, our charter provides that (i) no person shall beneficially own shares of stock to the extent such beneficial ownership of stock would result in us failing to qualify as a \u201cdomestically controlled qualified investment entity\u201d within the meaning of Section 897(h) of the Code, and (ii) no person shall beneficially or constructively own shares of stock to the extent such beneficial or constructive ownership would cause us to own, beneficially or constructively, more than a 9.9% interest (as set forth in Section 856(d)(2)(B) of the Code) in a tenant of our real property. Any attempt to own or transfer shares of our stock in violation of these restrictions may result in the transfer being automatically void. Our charter also provides that shares of our capital stock acquired or held in excess of the\nownership limit will be transferred to a trust for the benefit of a charitable beneficiary that we designate, and that any person who acquires shares of our capital stock in violation of the ownership limit will not be entitled to any dividends on the shares or be entitled to vote the shares or receive any proceeds from the subsequent sale of the shares in excess of the lesser of the market price on the day the shares were transferred to the trust or the amount realized from the sale. We or our designee will have the right to purchase the shares from the trustee at this calculated price as well. A transfer of shares of our capital stock in violation of the limit may be void under certain circumstances. Our 9.8% ownership limitation may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control, including an extraordinary transaction (such as a merger, tender offer or sale of all or substantially all of our assets) that might provide a premium price for our stockholders.\nMaryland law and provisions in our charter and bylaws may delay or prevent takeover attempts by third parties and therefore inhibit our stockholders from realizing a premium on their stock.\nOur charter and bylaws contain, and Maryland law contains, provisions that may deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids and encourage prospective acquirors to negotiate with our board of directors, rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. Our charter and bylaws, among other things, (1) contain transfer and ownership restrictions on the percentage by number and value of outstanding shares of our stock that may be owned or acquired by any stockholders; (2) permit the board of directors, without further action of the stockholders, to increase or decrease the authorized number of shares, issue additional shares, classify or reclassify unissued shares, and issue and fix the terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock, which may have rights senior to those of the common stock; (3) establish certain advance notice procedures for stockholder proposals and director nominations; and (4) provide that special meetings of stockholders may only be called by the company or upon written request of ten percent in voting power of our outstanding common stock.\nUnder Maryland law, any written consent of our stockholders must be unanimous. In addition, Maryland law allows a Maryland corporation with a class of equity securities registered under the Exchange Act to amend its charter without stockholder approval to effect a reverse stock split at a ratio of not more than ten shares of stock into one share of stock in any twelve-month period.\nIf we are not able to hire, or if we lose, key management personnel, we may not be able to successfully manage our business and achieve our objectives.\nOur success depends in large part upon the leadership and performance of our executive management team and other key employees and our ability to attract other key personnel to our business. If we are unable to hire, or if we lose the services of, our executive management team or we are not able to hire or we lose other key employees, we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our business objectives.\nWe or our tenants may experience uninsured or underinsured losses, which could result in a significant loss of the capital we have invested in a property, decrease anticipated future revenues or cause us to incur unanticipated expense.\nThe Leases require, and new lease agreements that we enter into are expected to require, that the tenant maintain comprehensive insurance and hazard insurance or self-insure its obligations. However, we cannot assure you that we will continue to require the same levels of insurance coverage under our Leases, that such insurance will be available at a reasonable cost in the future or that the insurance coverage provided will fully cover all losses on our properties upon the occurrence of a catastrophic event, nor can we assure you of the future financial viability of the insurers. Certain types of losses, generally of a catastrophic nature, such as earthquakes, hurricanes and floods, may be uninsurable or not economically insurable by us or by our tenants. Insurance coverage may not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement cost of a loss. Inflation, changes in building codes and ordinances, environmental considerations and other factors might also make it unfeasible to use insurance proceeds to replace the property after such property has been damaged or destroyed. Under such circumstances, the insurance proceeds received might not be adequate to restore the economic position with respect to such property.\nThe Properties and the Kerrow Restaurant Operating Business are located in 44 states, and if one of our properties experiences a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds policy coverage limits, we could lose the capital invested in the damaged property as well as the anticipated future cash flows from the property. If the damaged property is subject to recourse indebtedness, we could continue to be liable for the indebtedness even if the property is irreparably damaged.\nIn addition, even if damage to our properties is covered by insurance, a disruption of business caused by a casualty event may result in loss of revenue for our tenants or us. Any business interruption insurance may not fully compensate them or us for such loss of revenue. If one of our tenants experiences such a loss, it may be unable to satisfy its payment obligations to us under its lease with us.\nOur relationship with Darden may adversely affect our ability to do business with third-party restaurant operators and other tenants.\nDarden is our only tenant under the Leases, and our revenue consists primarily of rental payments from Darden. We may be viewed by third-party restaurant operators and other potential tenants or parties to sale-leaseback transactions as being closely affiliated with Darden. As these third-party restaurant operators and other potential transaction parties may compete with Darden within the restaurant industry, our perceived affiliation with Darden could make it difficult for us to attract tenants and other transaction partners beyond Darden, particularly in the restaurant industry. If we are unable to diversify our tenant and transaction partner base beyond Darden, it may have a materially adverse effect on our ability to operate and grow our business and our ability to achieve our strategic objectives.\nThe ownership by our executive officers and directors of common stock, options or other equity awards of Darden may create, or may create the appearance of, conflicts of interest.\nAs a result of his former positions with Darden, Mr. Lenehan owns common stock, including restricted stock, in both Darden and Four Corners. In addition, there is no restriction on our executive officers and directors acquiring Darden common stock in the future, and, therefore, this ownership of common stock of both Darden and Four Corners may be significant. Equity interests in Darden may create, or appear to create, conflicts of interest when any such director or executive officer is faced with decisions that could benefit or affect the equity holders of Darden in ways that do not benefit or affect us in the same manner. As of March 18, 2016, no other executive officer or director of Four Corners owns common stock of Darden.\nReal estate investments are relatively illiquid and provisions in the Leases may adversely impact our ability to sell properties and could adversely impact the price at which we can sell the properties.\nThe Properties, the properties leased to Kerrow and the properties owned by Kerrow subject to ground leases represent a substantial portion of our total consolidated assets, and these investments are relatively illiquid. As a result, our ability to sell one or more of our properties or other investments in real estate we may make in response to any changes in economic or other conditions may be limited. If we want to sell a property, we cannot assure you that we will be able to dispose of it in the desired time period, or at all, or that the sale price of a property will exceed the cost of our investment in that property.\nIn addition, the Properties subject to the Leases with Darden provide them a right of first offer with respect to our sale of any Property, provided there is no default under the Lease, and we are prohibited from selling any Properties to (i) any nationally recognized casual or fine dining brand restaurant or entity operating the same or (ii) any other regionally recognized casual or fine dining brand restaurant or entity operating the same, with 25 or more units. The existence of these provisions in the Leases, which survive for the full term of the relevant Lease, could adversely impact our ability to sell any of the Properties and could adversely impact our ability to obtain the highest possible price for any of the Properties. If we seek to sell any of the Properties, we would not be able to offer the Properties to potential purchasers through a competitive bid process or in a similar manner designed to maximize the value obtained without first offering to sell to Darden and we would be restricted in the potential purchasers who could buy the Properties, which may adversely impact our ability to sell any of the Properties in a timely manner, or at all, or adversely impact the price we can obtain from such sale.\nWe are dependent on the restaurant industry and may be susceptible to the risks associated with it, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial position or results of operations.\nAs the owner of properties serving the restaurant industry, we are impacted by the risks associated with the restaurant industry. Therefore, our success is to some degree dependent on the restaurant industry, which could be adversely affected by economic conditions in general, changes in consumer trends and preferences and other factors over which we, Darden, and any of our other tenants in the restaurant industry have no control. As we are subject to risks inherent in substantial investments in a single industry,\na decrease in the restaurant business would likely have a greater adverse effect on our revenues than if we owned a more diversified real estate portfolio.\nThe restaurant industry is characterized by a high degree of competition among a large number of participants. Competition is intense between national and regional restaurant chains and locally-owned restaurants in most of the markets where our properties are located. As competing properties are constructed, the lease rates we assess for our properties may be negatively impacted upon renewal or new tenant pricing events.\nDarden\u2019s business is subject to government regulations and changes in current or future laws or regulations could restrict their ability to operate both their and our business in the manner currently contemplated.\nDarden, and to a large extent the restaurant industry as a whole, is subject to extensive federal, state and local and international laws and regulations. The development and operation of restaurants depend to a significant extent on the selection and acquisition of suitable sites, which are subject to building, zoning, land use, environmental, traffic and other regulations and requirements. Darden is subject to licensing and regulation by state and local authorities relating to wages and hours, healthcare, health, sanitation, safety and fire standards and the sale of alcoholic beverages. Darden is also subject to, among other laws and regulations, laws and regulations relating to the preparation and sale of food, including regulations regarding product safety, nutritional content and menu labeling. The impact of current laws and regulations, the effect of future changes in laws or regulations that impose additional requirements and the consequences of litigation relating to current or future laws and regulations, or an insufficient or ineffective response to significant regulatory or public policy issues, could have an adverse effect on Darden\u2019s results of operations, which could also adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition as we depend on Darden for almost the entirety of our revenue.\nEnvironmental compliance costs and liabilities associated with real estate properties owned by us may materially impair the value of those investments.\nAs an owner and operator of real property, we are subject to various federal, state and local environmental and health and safety laws and regulations. We may be held primarily or jointly and severally liable for costs relating to the investigation and clean-up of any of our current or former properties at or from which there has been a release or threatened release of hazardous materials as well as other affected properties, regardless of whether we knew of or caused the contamination.\nIn addition to these costs, which are typically not limited by law or regulation and could exceed the property\u2019s value, we or our tenants could be subject to other liabilities, including governmental penalties for violation of environmental, health and safety laws, liabilities for injuries to persons for exposure to hazardous materials, and damages to property or natural resources. Furthermore, some environmental laws can create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and the costs the government incurs in connection with such contamination or can restrict the manner in which a property may be used because of contamination. We also could be liable for the costs of remediating contamination at third party sites, e.g., landfills, where we send waste for disposal without regard to whether we comply with environmental laws in doing so.\nThe presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may adversely affect our ability to sell, develop or lease the real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral.\nWe may be subject to liabilities and costs associated with the impacts of climate change.\nThe potential physical impacts of climate change on our properties or operations are highly uncertain and would be particular to the geographic circumstances in areas in which we operate, including Florida, Georgia and Texas. Such impacts may result from changes in rainfall and storm patterns and intensities, water shortages, changing sea levels, rising energy and environmental costs, and changing temperatures. These impacts may adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition, including our ability to obtain property insurance on terms we find acceptable.\nCompliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and fire, safety and other regulations may require us to make unanticipated expenditures that materially adversely impact our cash flow.\nAll of our properties are required to comply with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act, or the ADA. The ADA generally requires that buildings be made accessible to people with disabilities. Compliance with the ADA requirements could\nrequire, for example, removal of access barriers and non-compliance could result in the imposition of fines by the U.S. Government or an award of damages to private litigants, or both. While the tenants to whom we lease properties are obligated by law to comply with the ADA provisions, under the law we are also legally responsible for our properties\u2019 ADA compliance. If required changes involve greater expenditures than anticipated, or if the changes must be made on a more accelerated basis than anticipated, the ability of our tenants to cover costs could be adversely affected and we could be required to expend our own funds to comply with the provisions of the ADA, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and our ability to make distributions. State and local laws may also require modifications to our properties related to access by disabled persons. In addition, we are required to operate our properties in compliance with fire and safety regulations, building codes and other land use regulations, as they may be adopted by governmental agencies and bodies and become applicable to our properties. We may be required to make substantial capital expenditures to comply with those requirements and these expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow and ability to make distributions to our security holders.\nOur active management and operation of a restaurant business may expose us to potential liabilities beyond those traditionally associated with REITs.\nIn addition to our real estate investment activities, we also manage and operate the Kerrow Restaurant Operating Business, which consists of six LongHorn Steakhouse\u00ae restaurants located in the San Antonio, Texas area. Managing and operating the Kerrow Restaurant Operating Business requires us to employ significantly more people than a REIT which did not operate a business of such type and scale. In addition, managing and operating an active restaurant business exposes us to potential liabilities associated with the operation of restaurants. Such potential liabilities are not typically associated with REITs and include potential liabilities for wage and hour violations, guest discrimination, food safety issues including poor food quality, food-borne illness, food tampering, food contamination, workplace injury, and violation of \u201cdram shop\u201d laws (providing an injured party with recourse against an establishment that serves alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated party who then causes injury to himself or a third party). In the event that one or more of the potential liabilities associated with managing and operating an active restaurant business materializes, such liabilities could damage the reputation of the Kerrow Restaurant Operating Business as well as the reputation of Four Corners, and could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations, possibly to a material degree.\nIf our security measures are breached, we may face liability and public perception of our services could be diminished, which would negatively impact our ability to attract business partners and advertisers.\nOur security measures are not perfect or impenetrable, and we may be unable to anticipate or prevent unauthorized access. A cyber-attack or other security breach could occur due to the actions of outside parties, employee error, malfeasance or a combination of these or other actions. If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, we could lose competitively sensitive business information or suffer disruptions to our business operations. In addition, the public perception of the effectiveness of our security measures or services could be harmed, we could lose consumers, business partners and advertisers, and we could suffer financial exposure in connection with remediation efforts, investigations and legal proceedings and changes in our security and system protection measures.\nWe may be unable to make, on a timely or cost-effective basis, the changes necessary to operate as an independent, publicly traded, self-administered company primarily focused on owning real property used in the restaurant and retail industries and potentially other industries.\nWe have no historical operations as an independent company and may not be able to establish the infrastructure and attract the personnel necessary to operate as a separate, publicly traded, self-administered company. Upon the completion of the Spin-Off, Darden became obligated to provide certain transition services pursuant to the terms of the Transition Services Agreement that we entered into with Darden, to allow us the time, if necessary, to build the infrastructure and retain the personnel necessary to operate as a separate publicly traded company without relying on such services. Following the expiration of the Transition Services Agreement in 2016, Darden will be under no obligation to provide further assistance to us, other than the services contemplated in the Franchise Agreements. As a separate public entity, we are subject to, and responsible for, regulatory compliance, including, but not limited to, periodic public filings with the SEC and compliance with New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d) continued listing requirements as well as compliance with generally applicable tax and accounting rules. Because our business has not previously operated as a separate, publicly traded, self-administered company, we cannot assure you that we will be able\nto successfully implement the infrastructure or retain the personnel necessary to operate as a separate publicly traded company or that we will not incur costs in excess of anticipated costs to establish such infrastructure and retain such personnel.\nFailure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could materially and adversely affect our business and the market price of our common stock.\nUnder the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we must maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, which requires significant resources and management oversight. Internal control over financial reporting is complex and may be revised over time to adapt to changes in our business, or changes in applicable accounting rules. We cannot assure you that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective in the future or that a material weakness will not be discovered with respect to a prior period for which we had previously believed that internal controls were effective. Matters impacting our internal controls may cause us to be unable to report our financial data on a timely basis, or may cause us to restate previously issued financial data, and thereby subject us to adverse regulatory consequences, including sanctions or investigations by the SEC, or violations of applicable stock exchange listing rules. There could also be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of investor confidence in us and the reliability of our financial statements. Confidence in the reliability of our financial statements is also likely to suffer if we or our independent registered public accounting firm reports a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. This could materially adversely affect us by, for example, leading to a decline in the market price for our common stock and impairing our ability to raise capital.\nRisks Related to the Spin-Off\nWe may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve from the Spin-Off.\nWe may not be able to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve as a company independent from Darden in the time we expect, if at all, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and our ability to make distributions. For instance, it may take longer than anticipated for us to, or we may never, succeed in attracting tenants other than Darden. In addition, because historically Darden has owned and managed its own real estate assets, including the Properties and the restaurant properties comprising the Kerrow Restaurant Operating Business, we do not have any meaningful experience as lessors of properties to third-party restaurant and other operators in a competitive environment. Our lack of experience, including dealing with parties other than Darden in real estate transactions, and operating in a competitive environment, may materially inhibit our ability to realize the full value of our properties, to acquire further properties and achieve our short-term and long-term strategic objectives.\nWe could be required to indemnify Darden for material taxes pursuant to indemnification obligations under the Tax Matters Agreement that we entered into with Darden. If the Spin-Off were to fail to qualify as a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, Darden and Darden\u2019s shareholders could be subject to significant tax liabilities and, in certain circumstances, we could be required to indemnify Darden for material taxes.\nDarden has received a private letter ruling (the \u201cIRS Ruling\u201d) from the Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) on certain specific issues relevant to the qualification of the Spin-Off as tax-free under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Code, based on certain facts and representations set forth in such request. Although a private letter ruling from the IRS generally is binding on the IRS, if the factual representations made in the ruling request are untrue or incomplete in any material respect, then Darden will not be able to rely on the IRS Ruling. The IRS Ruling does not address all of the requirements for tax-free treatment of the Spin-Off under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code; however, Darden has received an opinion from Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP (\u201cSkadden, Arps\u201d) (the \u201cSpin-Off Tax Opinion\u201d) to the effect that the Spin-Off qualifies as tax-free under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Code. The Spin-Off Tax Opinion relies on the IRS Ruling as to matters covered by such ruling and is based on, among other things, current law and certain assumptions and representations as to factual matters made by Darden and us. Any change in currently applicable law, which may or may not be retroactive, or the failure of any factual representation or assumption to be true, correct and complete in all material respects, could adversely affect the conclusions reached by counsel in the Spin-Off Tax Opinion. The Spin-Off Tax Opinion is not binding on the IRS or the courts, and the IRS or the courts may not agree with the opinion. The Spin-Off Tax Opinion is expressed as of the date issued and does not cover subsequent periods. An opinion of counsel represents counsel\u2019s best legal judgment based on current law and is not binding on the IRS or any court. We cannot assure you that the IRS will agree with the conclusions set forth in the Spin-Off Tax Opinion, and it is possible that the IRS or another tax authority could adopt a position contrary to one or all of those conclusions and that a court could sustain that\ncontrary position. If any of the facts, representations, assumptions, or undertakings described or made in connection with the IRS Ruling or the Spin-Off Tax Opinion are not correct, are incomplete or have been violated, the IRS Ruling could be revoked retroactively or modified by the IRS, and our ability to rely on the Spin-Off Tax Opinion could be jeopardized. We are not aware of any facts or circumstances, however, that would cause these facts, representations, or assumptions to be untrue or incomplete, or that would cause any of these undertakings to fail to be complied with, in any material respect.\nIf the Spin-Off ultimately were determined to be taxable, then a shareholder of Darden that received shares of our common stock in the Spin-Off would be treated as having received a distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of such shares on the distribution date and could incur significant income tax liabilities. Such distribution would be taxable to such shareholder as a dividend to the extent of Darden\u2019s current and accumulated earnings and profits (including earnings and profits resulting from the recognition of gain by Darden in the Spin-Off). Any amount that exceeded Darden\u2019s earnings and profits would be treated first as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of such shareholder\u2019s tax basis in its shares of Darden stock with any remaining amount being taxed as a capital gain. In addition, if the Spin-Off were determined to be taxable, in general, Darden would be required to recognize a taxable gain as if it had sold our common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value.\nUnder the terms of the Tax Matters Agreement that we entered into with Darden, we generally will be responsible for any taxes imposed on Darden that arise from the failure of the Spin-Off to qualify as tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes to the extent such failure to qualify is attributable to certain actions, events or transactions relating to our stock, assets or business, or a breach of the relevant representations or any covenants made by us in the Tax Matters Agreement, the materials submitted to the IRS in connection with the request for the IRS Ruling or the representations provided in connection with the Spin-Off Tax Opinion. Our indemnification obligations to Darden will not be limited by any maximum amount. If we are required to indemnify Darden under the circumstances set forth in the Tax Matters Agreement, we may also be subject to substantial tax liabilities.\nWe may not be able to engage in desirable strategic transactions and equity issuances following the Spin-Off because of certain restrictions relating to requirements for tax-free distributions for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In addition, we could be liable for adverse tax consequences resulting from engaging in significant strategic or capital-raising transactions.\nTo preserve the tax-free treatment to Darden of the Spin-Off, for the two-year period following the Spin-Off, we may be prohibited, except in specific circumstances, from taking certain actions, including: (1) entering into any transaction pursuant to which all or a portion of our stock would be acquired, whether by merger or otherwise, (2) issuing equity securities beyond certain thresholds, or (3) repurchasing our common stock. In addition, we may be prohibited from taking or failing to take any other action that prevents the Spin-Off and related transactions from being tax-free. However, these restrictions are inapplicable in the event that the IRS has granted a favorable ruling to Darden or us or in the event that Darden or we have received an opinion from counsel that we can take such actions under certain safe harbor exceptions without adversely affecting the tax-free status of the Spin-Off and related transactions.\nThese restrictions may limit our ability to pursue strategic transactions or engage in new business or other transactions that may increase the value of our business.\nOur potential indemnification liabilities pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement could materially adversely affect us.\nThe Separation and Distribution Agreement we entered into with Darden on October 21, 2015 (the \u201cSeparation and Distribution Agreement\u201d) sets forth, among other things, the principal corporate transactions required to effect the separation, and provisions governing the relationship between Darden and us with respect to and resulting from the separation.\nAmong other things, the Separation and Distribution Agreement provides for indemnification obligations designed to make us financially responsible for substantially all liabilities that may exist relating to or arising out of the Properties and the Kerrow Operating Business. If we are required to indemnify Darden under the circumstances set forth in the Separation and Distribution Agreement, we may be subject to substantial liabilities.\nIn connection with our separation from Darden, Darden also indemnified us for certain liabilities. However, there can be no assurance that these indemnities will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that Darden\u2019s ability to satisfy its indemnification obligation will not be impaired in the future.\nPursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement, Darden has agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities. However, third parties could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that Darden has agreed to retain, and there can be no assurance that Darden will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations to us. Moreover, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from Darden any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses while seeking recovery from Darden. Additionally, pursuant to the terms of the Leases, Darden has agreed to indemnify us from and against any and all losses caused by, incurred or resulting from Darden\u2019s operations at the Properties or by Darden\u2019s use and occupancy of the Properties. However, third parties could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that Darden has agreed to retain, and there can be no assurance that Darden will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations to us.\nA court could deem the Spin-Off or its related transactions to be a fraudulent conveyance and void the transaction or impose substantial liabilities on us.\nWe have declared and paid to our stockholders dividends to distribute the accumulated earnings and profits attributable to non-REIT years (the \u201cPurging Distribution\u201d). A court could deem the Spin-Off of our common stock or certain internal restructuring transactions undertaken by Darden in connection therewith, or the Purging Distribution (for further explanation, see \u201c--There are uncertainties relating to the Purging Distribution\u201d below) by Four Corners, to be a fraudulent conveyance or transfer. Fraudulent conveyances or transfers are defined to include transfers made or obligations incurred with the actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud current or future creditors or transfers made or obligations incurred for less than reasonably equivalent value when the debtor was insolvent, or that rendered the debtor insolvent, inadequately capitalized or unable to pay its debts as they become due.\nIf a U.S. court were to find that the Spin-Off was a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, a court could void the Spin-Off or impose substantial liabilities upon us, which could adversely affect our financial condition and our results of operations. Among other things, the court could require our stockholders to return to Darden some or all of the shares of our common stock distributed in the Spin-Off, require us to fund liabilities of other companies involved in the restructuring transactions for the benefit of creditors, or require stockholders to pay as money damages an equivalent of the value of the shares of common stock at the time of the Spin-Off. If a U.S. court were to find that the Purging Distribution was a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, a court could void the Purging Distribution, require stockholders to return to us some or all of the Purging Distribution or require stockholders to pay as money damages an equivalent of the value of the Purging Distribution. Moreover, stockholders could be required to return any dividends previously paid by us. With respect to any transfers from Darden to us, if any such transfer was found to be fraudulent transfer, a court could void the transaction or Darden could be awarded monetary damages for the difference between the consideration received by Darden and the fair market value of the transferred property at the time of the Spin-Off. Whether a transaction is a fraudulent conveyance or transfer will vary depending upon the jurisdiction whose law is being applied.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe market price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile and may face negative pressure including as a result of future sales or distributions of our common stock.\nOur common stock is trading publicly for the first time. Until, and possibly even after, orderly trading markets develop for the common stock, there may be significant fluctuations in price. It is not possible to accurately predict how investors in our common stock will behave. Investors may decide to dispose of some or all of our common stock that they received in the Spin-Off, which may generally be sold immediately in the public market.\nAny disposition by a significant stockholder of our common stock, or the perception in the market that such dispositions could occur, may cause the price of our common stock to fall. Any such decline could impair our ability to raise capital through future sales of our common stock. Furthermore, our common stock may not qualify for investment indices, including indices specific to REITs, and any such failure may discourage new investors from investing in our common stock.\nOur ability to engage in significant equity issuances will also be limited or restricted after our Spin-Off from Darden in order to preserve the tax-free nature of the Spin-Off. If and when additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities, including our common stock, our stockholders may experience significant dilution.\nWe cannot assure you of our ability to pay dividends in the future.\nIt is expected that our initial dividend will be $0.97 per share per annum after reflecting the issuance of additional common shares to shareholders as part of the Purging Distribution. We may pay a portion of our dividends in common stock. In no event will the annual dividend be less than 90% of our REIT taxable income on an annual basis, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gains. Our ability to pay dividends may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including the risk factors described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Dividends will be authorized by our board of directors and declared by us based upon a number of factors, including actual results of operations, restrictions under Maryland law or applicable debt covenants, our financial condition, our taxable income, the annual distribution requirements under the REIT provisions of the Code, our operating expenses and other factors our directors deem relevant. We cannot assure you that we will achieve investment results that will allow us to make a specified level of cash dividends or year-to-year increases in cash dividends in the future.\nFurthermore, while we are required to pay dividends in order to maintain our REIT status (as described above in the risk factor \u201c--REIT distribution requirements could adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan\u201d), we may elect not to maintain our REIT status, in which case we would no longer be required to pay such dividends. Moreover, even if we do elect to maintain our REIT status, after completing various procedural steps, we may elect to comply with the applicable distribution requirements by distributing, under certain circumstances, a portion of the required amount in the form of shares of our common stock in lieu of cash. If we elect not to maintain our REIT status or to satisfy any required distributions in shares of common stock in lieu of cash, such action could negatively affect our business and financial condition as well as the market price of our common stock. No assurance can be given that we will pay any dividends on shares of our common stock in the future.\nRisks Related to Our Taxation as a REIT\nIf we do not qualify as a REIT, or fail to remain qualified as a REIT, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax as a regular corporation and could face a substantial tax liability, which would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders.\nWe intend to operate in a manner that will enable us to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year beginning January 1, 2016. Our ability to satisfy the asset tests depends upon our analysis of the fair market values of our assets, some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination, and for which we do not obtain independent appraisals. Our compliance with the REIT income and asset requirements also depends upon our ability to successfully manage the composition of our income and assets on an ongoing basis. Moreover, the proper classification of one or more of our investments may be uncertain in some circumstances, which could affect the application of the REIT qualification requirements. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the IRS will not contend that our investments violate the REIT requirements.\nDarden received an opinion of Skadden, Arps, counsel to Darden, with respect to our qualification to be subject to tax as a REIT in connection with the Spin-Off. Investors should be aware, however, that opinions of counsel are not binding on the IRS or any court. The REIT Tax Opinion represents only the view of Skadden, Arps, based on its review and analysis of existing law and on certain representations as to factual matters and covenants made by Darden and us, including representations relating to the values of our assets and the sources of our income. The opinion is expressed as of the date issued. Skadden, Arps has no obligation to advise Darden, us or the holders of our common stock of any subsequent change in the matters stated, represented or assumed or of any subsequent change in applicable law. Furthermore, both the validity of the REIT Tax Opinion and our qualification as a REIT will depend on our satisfaction of various complex requirements under the Code, relating to, among other things, the sources of our gross income, the composition and value of our assets, our distribution levels and the diversity of ownership of our shares on a continuing basis, the results of which will not be monitored by Skadden, Arps. Our ability to satisfy the asset tests depends upon our analysis of the characterization and fair market values of our assets, some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination, and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals.\nIf we were to fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we would be subject to U.S. federal income tax, including any applicable alternative minimum tax, on our taxable income at regular corporate rates, and distributions to stockholders would not be deductible by us in computing our taxable income. Any such corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders, which in turn could have an adverse impact on the value of, and trading prices for, our common stock. Unless entitled to relief under certain provisions of the Code, we also would be disqualified from taxation as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which we initially ceased to qualify as a REIT.\nThe rule against re-electing REIT status following a loss of such status could also apply to us if it were determined that a former subsidiary of Darden failed to qualify as a REIT for certain taxable years and we were treated as a successor to such entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Although Darden has represented to us that it has no knowledge of any fact or circumstance that would cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT and covenanted to use its reasonable best efforts to cure any issue with respect to the REIT status of any such predecessor entity, no assurance can be given that such representation and covenant would prevent us from failing to qualify as a REIT. If we fail to qualify as a REIT due to the REIT status of a predecessor, we would be subject to corporate income tax as described in the preceding paragraph.\nQualifying as a REIT involves highly technical and complex provisions of the Code.\nQualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex Code provisions for which only limited judicial and administrative authorities exist. Even a technical or inadvertent violation could jeopardize our REIT qualification. Our qualification as a REIT will depend on our satisfaction of certain asset, income, organizational, distribution, stockholder ownership, and other requirements on a continuing basis. In addition, our ability to satisfy the requirements to qualify as a REIT may depend in part on the actions of third parties over which we have no control or only limited influence.\nWe could fail to qualify as a REIT if income we receive from Darden and other tenants is not treated as qualifying income.\nUnder applicable provisions of the Code, we will not be treated as a REIT unless we satisfy various requirements, including requirements relating to the sources of our gross income. Rents received or accrued by us from Darden and other tenants will not be treated as qualifying rent for purposes of these requirements if the Leases are not respected as true leases for U.S. federal income tax purposes and are instead treated as service contracts, joint ventures or other types of arrangements. If the Leases are not respected as true leases for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we may fail to qualify as a REIT.\nIn addition, subject to certain exceptions, rents received or accrued by us from Darden will not be treated as qualifying rent for purposes of the REIT gross income requirements if we or a beneficial or constructive owner of 10% or more of our stock beneficially or constructively owns 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of Darden stock entitled to vote or 10% or more of the total value of all classes of Darden stock. Our charter provides for restrictions on ownership and transfer of our shares of stock, including restrictions on such ownership or transfer that would cause the rents received or accrued by us from Darden to be treated as non-qualifying rent for purposes of the REIT gross income requirements. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that such restrictions will be effective in ensuring that rents received or accrued by us from Darden will not be treated as qualifying rent for purposes of REIT qualification requirements.\nDividends payable by REITs do not qualify for the reduced tax rates available for some dividends.\nThe maximum U.S. federal income tax rate applicable to income from \u201cqualified dividends\u201d payable to U.S. stockholders that are individuals, trusts and estates is currently 20%. Dividends payable by REITs, however, generally are not eligible for the reduced rates. Although these rules do not adversely affect the taxation of REITs, the more favorable rates applicable to regular corporate qualified dividends could cause investors who are individuals, trusts and estates to perceive investments in REITs to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of non-REIT corporations that pay dividends, which could adversely affect the value of the stock of REITs, including our common stock.\nREIT distribution requirements could adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan.\nWe generally must distribute annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gains, in order for us to qualify as a REIT (assuming that certain other requirements are also satisfied) so that U.S. federal corporate income tax does not apply to earnings that we distribute. To the extent that we\nsatisfy this distribution requirement and qualify for taxation as a REIT but distribute less than 100% of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and including any net capital gains, we will be subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on our undistributed net taxable income. In addition, we will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that we distribute to our stockholders in a calendar year is less than a minimum amount specified under U.S. federal tax laws. We intend to make distributions to our stockholders to comply with the REIT requirements of the Code.\nInitially our funds from operations will be generated primarily by rents paid under the Leases. From time to time, we may generate taxable income greater than our cash flow as a result of differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures, the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments. If we do not have other funds available in these situations, we could be required to borrow funds on unfavorable terms, sell assets at disadvantageous prices or distribute amounts that would otherwise be invested in future acquisitions to make distributions sufficient to enable us to pay out enough of our taxable income to satisfy the REIT distributions requirement and to avoid corporate income tax and the 4% excise tax in a particular year. These alternatives could increase our costs or reduce our equity or adversely impact our ability to raise short and long-term debt. Furthermore, the REIT distribution requirements may increase the financing needed to fund capital expenditures, further growth and expansion initiatives. Thus, compliance with the REIT requirements may hinder our ability to grow, which could adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nEven if we qualify as a REIT, we may face other tax liabilities that reduce our cash flow.\nEven if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to certain U.S. federal, state, and local taxes on our income and assets, including taxes on any undistributed income and state or local income, property and transfer taxes. For example, we will hold some of our assets and conduct certain of our activities through one or more TRSs or other subsidiary corporations that will be subject to U.S. federal, state, and local corporate-level income taxes as regular C corporations. In addition, we may incur a 100% excise tax on transactions with a TRS if they are not conducted on an arm\u2019s-length basis. Any of these taxes would decrease cash available for distribution to our stockholders.\nComplying with the REIT requirements may cause us to forego otherwise attractive acquisition and business opportunities or liquidate otherwise attractive investments.\nTo qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we must ensure that, at the end of each calendar quarter, at least 75% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash items, government securities and \u201creal estate assets\u201d (as defined in the Code). The remainder of our investments (other than government securities, qualified real estate assets and securities issued by a TRS) generally cannot include more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer or more than 10% of the total value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer. In addition, in general, no more than 5% of the value of our total assets (other than government securities, qualified real estate assets and securities issued by a TRS) can consist of the securities of any one issuer, and no more than 25% (20% effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017) of the value of our total assets can be represented by securities of one or more TRSs. Finally, effective for our taxable year that began on January 1, 2016 and all future taxable years, no more than 25% of the value of our assets can be represented by certain debt instruments issued by \u201cpublicly offered REITs.\u201d If we fail to comply with these requirements at the end of any calendar quarter, we must correct the failure within thirty days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provisions to avoid losing our REIT qualification and suffering adverse tax consequences. As a result, we may be required to liquidate or forego otherwise attractive investments. These actions could have the effect of reducing our income and amounts available for distribution to our stockholders.\nIn addition to the asset tests set forth above, to qualify as a REIT we must continually satisfy tests concerning, among other things, the sources of our income, the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our stock. We may be unable to pursue investments that would be otherwise advantageous to us in order to satisfy the source-of-income or asset-diversification requirements for qualifying as a REIT. Thus, compliance with the REIT requirements may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments.\nREIT ownership limitations may restrict or prevent you from engaging in certain transfers of our common stock.\nIn order to satisfy the requirements for REIT qualification, no more than 50% in value of all classes or series of our outstanding shares of stock may be owned, actually or constructively, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the Code to include certain\nentities) at any time during the last half of each taxable year commencing with our taxable year beginning January 1, 2017. As described above, subject to certain exceptions, rents received or accrued by us from Darden will not be treated as qualifying rent for purposes of the REIT gross income requirements if we or a beneficial or constructive owner of 10% or more of our stock beneficially or constructively owns 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of Darden stock entitled to vote or 10% or more of the total value of all classes of Darden stock. To assist us in satisfying the REIT requirements, our charter contains certain ownership and transfer restrictions on our stock. More specifically, our charter provides that shares of our capital stock acquired or held in excess of the ownership limit will be transferred to a trust for the benefit of a designated charitable beneficiary, and that any person who acquires shares of our capital stock in violation of the ownership limit will not be entitled to any dividends on such shares or be entitled to vote such shares or receive any proceeds from the subsequent sale of such shares in excess of the lesser of the price paid for such shares or the amount realized from the sale (net of any commissions and other expenses of sale). A transfer of shares of our capital stock in violation of the ownership limit will be void ab initio under certain circumstances. Under applicable constructive ownership rules, any shares of stock owned by certain affiliated owners generally would be added together for purposes of the common stock ownership limits, and any shares of a given class or series of preferred stock owned by certain affiliated owners generally would be added together for purposes of the ownership limit on such class or series. Our 9.8% ownership limitation may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of us, including an extraordinary transaction (such as a merger, tender offer or sale of all or substantially all of our assets) that might provide a premium price for our stockholders. See \u201cOur charter restricts the ownership and transfer of our outstanding stock, which may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or change of control of our company\u201d above.\nThere are uncertainties relating to the Purging Distribution.\nDarden has allocated its accumulated earnings and profits (as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes) for periods prior to the Spin-Off between Darden and Four Corners in a manner that, in its best judgment, is in accordance with the provisions of the Code. The amount of earnings and profits to be distributed is a complex factual and legal determination. We currently believe and intend that our Purging Distribution made on March 2, 2015 has satisfied the requirements relating to the distribution of our pre-REIT accumulated earnings and profits. No assurance can be given, however, that the IRS will agree with our calculation or Darden\u2019s allocation of earnings and profits to Four Corners. If the IRS finds additional amounts of pre-REIT earnings and profits, there are procedures generally available to cure any failure to distribute all of our pre-REIT earnings and profits, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement such procedures.\nWe paid the Purging Distribution in a combination of common stock and cash and are permitted to pay other dividends on our common stock in common stock and/or cash. Our stockholders may sell shares of our common stock to pay tax on such dividends, placing downward pressure on the market price of our common stock.\nWe paid the Purging Distribution in a combination of cash and common stock. Each stockholder was permitted to elect to receive the stockholder\u2019s entire entitlement under the Purging Distribution in either cash or Four Corners common stock, subject to the limitation on the amount of cash to be distributed in the aggregate to all of our stockholders (the \u201cCash Limitation\u201d). The Cash Limitation was approximately 20% of the Purging Distribution declaration (without regard to any cash that may be paid in lieu of fractional shares). In the Purging Distribution and any other distribution paid in a combination of cash and common stock, stockholders will be required to report dividend income as a result of such distribution for both the cash and stock components of the distribution and even though we distributed no cash or only nominal amounts of cash to such shareholder.\nIf we make any taxable dividend payable in cash and common stock, taxable stockholders receiving such dividends will be required to include the full amount of the dividend as ordinary income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits, as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, stockholders may be required to pay income tax with respect to such dividends in excess of the cash dividends received. If a U.S. stockholder sells shares of our stock that it receives as a dividend in order to pay this tax, the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend, depending on the market price of the stock at the time of the sale. Furthermore, with respect to certain non-U.S. stockholders, we may be required to withhold federal income tax with respect to such dividends, including in respect of all or a portion of such dividend that is payable in our stock. If, in any taxable dividend payable in cash and stock, a significant number of our stockholders determine to sell shares of our stock in order to pay taxes owed on dividends, it may be viewed as economically equivalent to a dividend reduction and put downward pressure on the market price of our stock.\nComplying with the REIT requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively and may cause us to incur tax liabilities.\nThe REIT provisions of the Code substantially limit our ability to hedge our assets and liabilities. Income from certain hedging transactions that we may enter into to manage risk of interest rate changes with respect to borrowings made or to be made to acquire or carry real estate assets does not constitute \u201cgross income\u201d for purposes of the 75% or 95% gross income tests that apply to REITs, provided that certain identification requirements are met. Effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2015, this exclusion from the 95% and 75% gross income tests also will apply if we previously entered into a hedge, a portion of the hedged indebtedness or property is disposed of, and in connection with such extinguishment or disposition we enter into a new clearly identified hedging transaction to offset the prior hedging position. To the extent that we enter into other types of hedging transactions or fail to properly identify such transaction as a hedge, the income is likely to be treated as non-qualifying income for purposes of both of the gross income tests. As a result of these rules, we may be required to limit our use of advantageous hedging techniques or implement those hedges through a TRS. This could increase the cost of our hedging activities because the TRS may be subject to tax on gains or expose us to greater risks associated with changes in interest rates that we would otherwise want to bear. In addition, losses in the TRS will generally not provide any tax benefit, except that such losses could theoretically be carried back or forward against past or future taxable income in the TRS.\nEven if we qualify to be subject to tax as a REIT, we could be subject to tax on any unrealized net built-in gains in our assets held before electing to be treated as a REIT.\nFollowing our REIT election, we will own appreciated assets that were held by a C corporation and will be acquired by us in a transaction in which the adjusted tax basis of the assets in our hands will be determined by reference to the adjusted basis of the assets in the hands of the C corporation. If we dispose of any such appreciated assets during the five-year period following our intended qualification as a REIT, we will be subject to tax at the highest corporate tax rates on any gain from such assets to the extent of the excess of the fair market value of the assets on the date that we became a REIT over the adjusted tax basis of such assets on such date, which are referred to as built-in gains. We would be subject to this tax liability even if we qualify and maintain our status as a REIT. Any recognized built-in gain will retain its character as ordinary income or capital gain and will be taken into account in determining REIT taxable income and our distribution requirement. Any tax on the recognized built-in gain will reduce REIT taxable income. We may choose not to sell in a taxable transaction appreciated assets we might otherwise sell during the five-year period in which the built-in gain tax applies in order to avoid the built-in gain tax. However, there can be no assurances that such a taxable transaction will not occur. If we sell such assets in a taxable transaction, the amount of corporate tax that we will pay will vary depending on the actual amount of net built-in gain or loss present in those assets as of the time we became a REIT. The amount of tax could be significant.\nLegislative or other actions affecting REITs could have a negative effect on us.\nThe rules dealing with U.S. federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the IRS and the U.S. Department of the Treasury (the \u201cTreasury\u201d). Changes to the tax laws or interpretations thereof, with or without retroactive application, could materially and adversely affect our investors or us. We cannot predict how changes in the tax laws might affect our investors or us. New legislation, Treasury regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly and negatively affect our ability to qualify as a REIT or the U.S. federal income tax consequences to our investors and us of such qualification.", "PERMNO": 15719, "SIC": 6798, "TIC": "FCPT"}
