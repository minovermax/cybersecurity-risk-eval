Statements other than those of historical fact, as well as those identified by the use of words such as \u201canticipate,\u201d \u201cestimate,\u201d \"intend,\" \u201cplan,\u201d \u201cexpect,\u201d \u201cbelieve,\u201d \u201cmay,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201cshould,\u201d \u201cwould,\u201d \u201ccould,\u201dand any variations of the foregoing and similar expressions, are forward-looking statements. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in any such forward-looking statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. Any such statements\nare subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, our actual financial results, performance or financial condition may vary materially from those anticipated, estimated, expected or implied by any forward-looking statements.\nAmong the key factors that could cause our actual financial results, performance or condition to differ from the expectations expressed or implied in such forward-looking statements are the following: recently enacted, proposed or future legislation and regulation and the manner in which it is implemented; the nature and scope of regulatory authority, particularly discretionary authority, that may be exercised by regulators, including, but not limited to, the CFPB, having jurisdiction over the Company\u2019s business or consumer financial transactions generically; the unpredictable nature of regulatory proceedings and litigation; any determinations, findings, claims or actions made or taken by the CFPB, other regulators or other third parties in connection with or resulting from the CID that assert or establish that the Company\u2019s lending practices or other aspects of its business violate applicable laws or regulations; the impact of changes in accounting rules and regulations, or their interpretation or application, which could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s reported financial statements or necessitate material delays or changes in the issuance of the Company\u2019s audited financial statements; the Company's assessment of its internal control over financial reporting, and the timing and effectiveness of the Company's efforts to remediate any reported material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting, which could lead to the Company to report further or unremediated material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting: changes in interest rates; risks relating to expansion and foreign operations, including but not limited to foreign currency fluctuations; risks inherent in making loans, including repayment risks and value of collateral; the timing and amount of revenues that may be recognized by the Company; changes in current revenue and expense trends (including trends affecting delinquency and charge-offs); changes in the Company\u2019s markets and general changes in the economy (particularly in the markets served by the Company). These and other risks are discussed in more detail below in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and in the Company\u2019s other filings made from time to time with the SEC. The Company does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements it may make.\nInvestors should consider the following risk factors, in addition to the other information presented in this annual report and the other reports and registration statements the Company files with or furnishes to the SEC from time to time, in evaluating us, our business and an investment in our securities. Any of the following risks, as well as other risks, uncertainties, and possibly inaccurate assumptions underlying our plans and expectations, could result in harm to our business, results of operations and financial condition and cause the value of our securities to decline, which in turn could cause investors to lose all or part of their investment in our Company. These factors, among others, could also cause actual results to differ materially from those we have experienced in the past or those we may express or imply from time to time in any forward-looking statements we make. Investors are advised that it is impossible to identify or predict all risks, and that risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also could affect us in the future.\nFederal legislative or regulatory proposals, initiatives, actions or changes that are adverse to our operations or result in adverse regulatory proceedings, or our failure to comply with existing or future federal laws and regulations, could force us to modify, suspend or cease part or all of our nationwide operations.\nWe are subject to numerous federal laws and regulations that affect our lending operations. Although these laws and regulations have remained substantially unchanged for many years, the laws and regulations directly affecting our lending activities have been under review and subject to change in recent years as a result of various developments and changes in economic conditions, the make-up of the executive and legislative branches of government, and the political and media focus on issues of consumer and borrower protection. Any changes in such laws and regulations could force us to modify, suspend or cease part, or, in the worst case, all of our existing operations. It is also possible that the scope of federal regulations could change or expand in such a way as to preempt what has traditionally been state law regulation of our business activities.\nIn July 2010 the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d) was enacted. The Dodd-Frank Act restructured and enhanced the regulation and supervision of the financial services industry and created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the \u201cCFPB\u201d), an agency with sweeping regulatory and enforcement authority over consumer financial transactions. Although the Dodd-Frank Act prohibits the CFPB from setting interest rates on consumer loans, efforts to create a federal usury cap, applicable to all consumer credit transactions and substantially below rates at which the Company could create to operate profitably, are still ongoing. Any federal legislative or regulatory action that severely restricts or prohibits the provision of small-loan consumer credit and similar services on terms substantially similar to those we currently provide would, if enacted, have a material adverse impact on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition. Any federal law that would impose a 36% or similar annualized credit rate cap on our services would, if enacted, almost certainly eliminate our ability to continue our current operations.\nThe CFPB\u2019s rulemaking and enforcement authority extends to certain non-depository institutions, including us. The CFPB is specifically authorized, among other things, to take actions to prevent companies providing consumer financial products or services\nand their service providers from engaging in unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices in connection with consumer financial products and services, and to issue rules requiring enhanced disclosures for consumer financial products or services. The CFPB may also issue regulations regarding the use of pre-dispute arbitration clauses in consumer financial markets, but only after conducting a study of the matter as mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act. The CFPB also has authority to interpret, enforce, and issue regulations implementing enumerated consumer laws, including certain laws that apply to our business. Further, the CFPB has authority to designate non-depository \u201clarger participants\u201d in certain markets for consumer financial services and products for purposes of the CFPB\u2019s supervisory authority under the Dodd-Frank Act. Such designated \u201clarger participants\u201d are subject to reporting and on-site compliance examinations by the CFPB, which may result in increased compliance costs and potentially greater enforcement risks based on these supervisory activities. Although the CFPB has not yet developed a \u201clarger participant\u201d rule that directly covers the Company\u2019s installment lending business, in March 2015 in connection with the CFPB\u2019s discussion of a proposed rulemaking initiative described below, the CFPB stated that it expects to conduct separate rulemaking to identify larger participants in the installment lending market for purposes of its supervision program. Though the timing of any such rulemaking is uncertain, the Company believes that the implementation of such rules would likely bring the Company\u2019s business under the CFPB\u2019s direct supervisory authority.\nOn March 26, 2015, the CFPB announced that it was considering proposing rules under its unfair, deceptive and abusive acts and practices rulemaking authority relating to payday, vehicle title, and similar loans. The proposal would cover short-term loans with a contractual term of 45 days or less, as well as \u201clonger-term loans\u201d with a term of longer than 45 days with an all-in annualized percentage rate of interest (\u201cAPR\u201d) in excess of 36% in which the lender has either a non-purchase money security interest in the consumer\u2019s vehicle or the right to collect repayment from the consumer\u2019s bank account or paycheck. Although the Company does not make loans with terms of 45 days or less or obtain access to a customer\u2019s bank account or paycheck for repayment of any of its loans, it does make some vehicle-secured loans with an APR within the scope of the proposal. The Company currently estimates that the amount of such vehicle-secured loans in its loan portfolio as of March 31, 2015 are approximately 13% of its total number of loans and approximately 20% of its portfolio by gross loan volume. The proposals would require a lender, as a condition of making a covered longer-term loan, to first make a good-faith reasonable determination that the consumer has the ability to repay the covered longer-term loan without reborrowing or defaulting. The proposals would require lenders to verify income, \u201cmajor financial obligations\u201d and borrowing history. Lenders would also be required to determine that a consumer is able to make all projected payments under the covered longer-term loan as those payments are due, while still fulfilling other major financial obligations and meeting living expenses. This ability to repay assessment would apply to both the initial longer-term loan and to any subsequent refinancing. In addition, the proposals would include a rebuttable presumption that customers seeking to refinance a covered longer-term loan lack an \u201cability to repay\u201d if certain conditions exist at the time of the proposed refinancing. See Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Regulatory Matters,\u201d for more information regarding these proposals. The proposals are subject to several procedural requirements and to possible change before any final rules would be issued and implemented, and we cannot predict what the ultimate rulemaking will provide. Although the Company currently underwrites all its loans (including those secured by a vehicle title that would fall within the scope of these proposals) by reviewing the customer\u2019s ability to repay based on the Company\u2019s standards, there can be no assurance that these proposals, if and when implemented in final rulemaking, would not require changes to the Company\u2019s practices and procedures regarding such loans that could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to make such loans, the cost of making such loans, the Company\u2019s ability to, or frequency with which it could, refinance any such covered loans, or the profitability of such loans. Any final rulemaking also could have effects beyond those contemplated in the initial proposal that could further materially and adversely impact our business and operations.\nIn addition to the specific matters described above, other aspects of our business may be the subject of future CFPB rulemaking. The enactment of one or more of such regulatory changes, or the exercise of broad regulatory authority by regulators, including but not limited to, the CFPB, having jurisdiction over the Company\u2019s business or discretionary consumer financial transactions generically, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and prospects.\nIn September 2014, the Department of Defense (the \u201cDoD\u201d) proposed an amendment to its existing regulation that implements the Military Lending Act (the \u201cMLA\u201d). Current MLA regulations prohibit creditors from making payday loans, non-purchase money motor vehicle title loans with a term of less than 181 days, and refund anticipation loans to \u201ccovered borrowers\u201d (which includes both servicemembers and their dependents) if the APR exceeds 36%. The Company does not make any of the loans covered under the MLA regulations. However, the proposed amendments would expand the MLA and its 36% APR cap to cover all credit offered or extended to a covered borrower primarily for personal, family, or household purposes that is either subject to a finance charge or payable by a written agreement in more than four installments. In addition, creditors must check a database maintained by the DoD before entering into an agreement with a covered borrower, provide both oral and written disclosures, including an all-inclusive APR referred to as the Military Annual Percentage Rate, and must not require arbitration in agreements with covered borrowers. In April 2015, the U.S. House Armed Services Committee narrowly voted to remove a provision in the 2016 National Defense Authorization Act that likely would have delayed implementation of the proposed amendments until 2016. The DoD proposed regulations are subject to possible change or further delay before any final rules would be issued and\nimplemented. However, the Company believes the implementation of these amendments could adversely affect its operations and cost and efficiency of processing loans by requiring it to perform confirming database checks on a much greater number of loans via a database that historically has been prone to technical glitches and outages. These or other consequences of the amendment could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are currently under investigation by the CFPB, and any adverse finding, allegation, or exercise of enforcement or regulatory discretion by the CFPB could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or ability to operate our business as we currently do.\nAs previously disclosed, on March 12, 2014, we received a Civil Investigative Demand (\u201cCID\u201d) from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the \u201cCFPB\u201d). The stated purpose of the CID is to determine whether the Company has been or is \u201cengaging in unlawful acts or practices in connection with the marketing, offering, or extension of credit in violation of Sections 1031 and 1036 of the Consumer Financial Protection Act, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5531, 5536, the Truth in Lending Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1601, et seq., Regulation Z, 12 C.F.R. pt. 1026, or any other Federal consumer financial law\u201d and \u201calso to determine whether Bureau action to obtain legal or equitable relief would be in the public interest.\u201d The Company responded, within the deadlines specified in the CID, to broad requests for production of documents, answers to interrogatories to and written reports related to loans made by the Company and numerous other aspects of the Company\u2019s business. Subsequent to the March 2014 CID, the Company has received and responded to, and is actively in the process of responding to, additional broad requests and demands for information from the CFPB and expects that there will continue to be additional requests or demands for information from the CFPB and ongoing interactions between the CFPB, the Company and Company counsel as part of the investigation. We are currently unable to predict the ultimate timing or outcome of the CFPB investigation. While the Company believes its marketing and lending practices are lawful, there can be no assurance that the CFPB\u2019s ongoing investigation or future exercise of its enforcement, regulatory, discretionary or other powers will not result in findings or alleged violations of federal consumer financial protection laws that could lead to enforcement actions, proceedings or litigation and the imposition of damages, fines, penalties, restitution, other monetary liabilities, sanctions, settlements or changes to the Company\u2019s business practices or operations that could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations or eliminate altogether the Company\u2019s ability to operate its business profitably or on terms substantially similar to those on which it currently operates.\nLitigation and regulatory actions, including challenges to the arbitration clauses in our customer agreements, could subject us to significant class actions, fines, penalties, judgments and requirements resulting in increased expenses and potential material adverse effects on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn the normal course of business, from time to time, we have been named as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation, arising in connection with our business activities. Certain of the legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory and punitive damages, or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. While the arbitration provisions in our customer agreements historically have limited our exposure to consumer class action litigation, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in enforcing our arbitration clause in the future. There may also be legislative, administrative or regulatory efforts to directly or indirectly prohibit the use of pre-dispute arbitration clauses, including by the CFPB, or we may be compelled as a result of competitive pressure or reputational concerns to voluntarily eliminate pre-dispute arbitration clauses.\nUnfavorable state legislative or regulatory actions or changes, adverse outcomes in litigation or regulatory proceedings or failure to comply with existing laws and regulations could force us to cease, suspend or modify our operations in a state, potentially resulting in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition to federal laws and regulations, we are subject to numerous state laws and regulations that affect our lending activities. Many of these regulations impose detailed and complex constraints on the terms of our loans, lending forms and operations. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to regulatory enforcement action that could result in the assessment against us of civil, monetary or other penalties, including the suspension or revocation of our licenses to lend in one or more jurisdictions.\nChanges in the state laws under which we currently operate or the enactment of new laws governing our operations resulting from state political activities and legislative or regulatory initiatives could have a material adverse effect on all aspects of our business in a particular state. For example, proponents of rate cap legislation in New Mexico have recently attempted to advance bills that would place a 36% rate cap on all financial lending products. In February 2015, these measures were tabled by The New Mexico Regulatory and public affairs subcommittee.\nThe Company, through state and federal trade associations of which it is a member, is working in opposition to this pending legislation; however, it is uncertain whether these efforts will be successful in preventing the passage of the legislation. Passage of such proposed legislation or similar initiatives in other states could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business,\nresults of operations, prospects or ability to continue operations in the jurisdictions affected by such changes. We can give no assurance that the laws and regulations that govern our business, or the interpretation or administration of those laws and regulations, will remain unchanged or that any such future changes will not materially and adversely affect or in the worst case, eliminate the Company\u2019s lending practices, operations, profitability or prospects.\nIn addition, any adverse change in existing laws or regulations, or any adverse interpretation or litigation relating to existing laws and regulations in any state in which we operate, could subject us to liability for prior operating activities or could lower or eliminate the profitability of our operations going forward by, among other things, reducing the amount of interest and fees we can charge in connection with our loans. If these or other factors lead us to close our branches in a state, then in addition to the loss of net revenues attributable to that closing, we would also incur closing costs such as lease cancellation payments and we would have to write off assets that we could no longer use. If we were to suspend rather than permanently cease our operations in a state, we may also have continuing costs associated with maintaining our branches and our employees in that state, with little or no revenues to offset those costs.\nMedia and public perception of consumer installment loans as being predatory or abusive could have a materially adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nConsumer activist groups and various other media sources continue to advocate for governmental and regulatory action to prohibit or severely restrict our products and services. These critics frequently characterize our products and services as predatory or abusive toward consumers. If this negative characterization of the consumer installment loans we make and/or ancillary services we provide becomes widely accepted by government policy makers or is embodied in legislative, regulatory, policy or litigation developments that adversely affect our ability to continue offering our products and services or the profitability of these products and services, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected.\nEmployee misconduct or misconduct by third parties acting on our behalf could harm us by subjecting us to monetary loss, significant legal liability, regulatory scrutiny and reputational harm.\nOur reputation is critical to maintaining and developing relationships with our existing and potential customers and third parties with whom we do business. There is a risk that our employees or third party contractors could engage in misconduct that adversely affects our business. For example, if an employee or a third party contractor were to engage in, or be accused or engaging in, illegal or suspicious activities including fraud or theft, we could suffer direct losses from the activity and, in addition, we could be subject to regulatory sanctions and suffer serious harm to our reputation, financial condition, customer relationships and ability to attract future customers. Employee or third-party misconduct could prompt regulators to allege or to determine based upon such misconduct that we have not established adequate supervisory systems and procedures to inform employees of applicable rules or to detect violations of such rules. Our branches have experienced employee fraud from time to time, and it is not always possible to deter employee or third-party misconduct. The precautions that we take to detect and prevent misconduct may not be effective in all cases. Misconduct by our employees or third party contractors, or even unsubstantiated allegations of misconduct, could result in a material adverse effect on our reputation and our business.\nOur continued expansion into Mexico may increase the risks inherent in conducting operations internationally and in Mexico, contribute materially to increased costs and negatively affect our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nAlthough our operations in Mexico accounted for only 8.6% of our revenues during fiscal 2015 and 8.5% of our gross loans receivable at March 31, 2015, we intend to continue opening branches and expanding our presence in Mexico. In addition, if and to the extent that the state and federal regulatory climate in the U.S. changes in ways that adversely affect our ability to continue profitable operations in one or more U.S. states, we could become increasingly dependent on our operations in Mexico as our only viable expansion or growth strategy. In pursuing such an expansion or growth strategy, we may expose an increasing portion of our business to risks inherent in conducting international operations, including currency fluctuations and devaluations, unsettled political and social conditions, communication and translation errors due to language barriers, compliance with differing legal and regulatory regimes and differing cultural attitudes toward regulation and compliance. In particular, political and social unrest in Mexico, coupled with a unionized labor structure that effectively gives labor unions control over repayment of funds remitted from our customers who borrow under our payroll deduction loan product in Mexico, create risks of non-payment or delinquent payment of these funds collected through the labor unions. We recently experienced such a situation in the third quarter of fiscal 2015 in which a union refused to make payments of $2.6 million related to such loans. If we are unable to resolve these issues and persuade the unions to remit these payments, our revenues, delinquencies and charge-off rates from our Mexican operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nInterest rate fluctuations may adversely affect our borrowing costs, profitability and liquidity.\nOur profitability may be directly affected by the level of and fluctuations in interest rates, whether caused by changes in economic conditions or other factors, that affect our borrowing costs. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the Federal Reserve Board. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence the amount of interest we pay on our revolving credit facility or any other floating interest rate obligations we may incur. Our profitability and liquidity could be materially adversely affected during any period of higher interest rates. See Part II, Item 7A, \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk\u201d for additional information regarding our interest rate risk.\nWe depend to a substantial extent on borrowings under our revolving credit agreement to fund our liquidity needs.\nWe have an existing revolving credit agreement that allows us to borrow up to $680.0 million through June 15, 2015 and up to $630.0 million through June 15, 2016, assuming we are in compliance with a number of covenants and conditions, including a minimum borowing base calculation. If our existing sources of liquidity become insufficient to satisfy our financial needs or our access to these sources becomes unexpectedly restricted, we may need to try to raise additional debt or equity in the future. If such an event were to occur, we can give no assurance that such alternate sources of liquidity would be available to us at all or on favorable terms. Additional information regarding our liquidity risk is included in Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nOur substantial debt could negatively impact our business, prevent us from satisfying our debt obligations and adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe have a substantial amount of debt. As of March 31, 2015, we had approximately $501.2 million of total debt outstanding and a total debt to shareholders equity ratio of approximately 1.6 to 1. The substantial amount of our debt could have important consequences, including the following:\nour ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, debt refinancing, share repurchases or other purposes could be impaired;\na substantial portion of our cash flows from operations will be dedicated to paying principal and interest on our debt, reducing funds available for other purposes;\nwe may be vulnerable to interest rate increases, as borrowings under our revolving credit agreement bear interest at variable rates, as may any future debt that we incur;\nwe could be more vulnerable to adverse developments in our industry or in general economic conditions;\nwe may be restricted from taking advantage of business opportunities or making strategic acquisitions; and\nwe may be limited in our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate.\nWe may incur substantially more debt and other liabilities. This could exacerbate further the risks associated with our current debt levels.\nWe may be able to incur substantial additional debt in the future. Although the terms of our revolving credit agreement contain restrictions on our ability to incur additional debt, as may any future debt that we incur, these restrictions are subject, or likely to be subject, in the case of any future debt, to exceptions that could permit us to incur a substantial amount of additional debt. In addition, our existing and future debt agreements will not prevent us from incurring certain liabilities that do not constitute indebtedness as defined for purposes of those debt agreements. If new debt or other liabilities are added to our current debt levels, the risks associated with our having substantial debt could intensify. As of March 31, 2015, we had $81.6 million available for borrowing under our revolving credit agreement, subject to borrowing base limitations and other specified terms and conditions.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to service our outstanding debt and fund operations and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under such debt.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on, or to refinance our indebtedness will depend in part on our cash flows from operations, which are subject to regulatory, economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will continue to generate a level of cash flows from operations sufficient to permit us to meet our debt service obligations. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to service our debt, we may be required to sell assets, refinance all or a portion of our existing debt, obtain additional financing or obtain additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. There can be no assurance that any refinancing will be possible or that any asset sales or additional financing can be completed on acceptable terms or at all.\nThe terms of our debt limit how we conduct our business.\nOur revolving credit agreement contains covenants that restrict our ability to, among other things:\nincur and guarantee debt;\npay dividends or make other distributions on or redeem or repurchase our stock;\nmake investments or acquisitions;\ncreate liens on our assets;\nsell assets;\nmerge with or into other companies;\nenter into transactions with shareholders and other affiliates; and\nmake capital expenditures.\nOur revolving credit agreement also imposes requirements that we maintain specified financial measures not in excess of, or not below, specified levels. In particular, our revolving credit agreement requires, among other things, that we maintain (i) at all times a specified minimum consolidated net worth, (ii) as of the end of each fiscal quarter, a minimum ratio of consolidated net income available for fixed charges for the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters most recently ended to consolidated fixed charges for that period of not less than a specified minimum, (iii) at all times a specified maximum ratio of total debt to consolidated adjusted net worth and (iv) at all times a specified ratio of subordinated debt to consolidated adjusted net worth. These covenants limit the manner in which we can conduct our business and could prevent us from engaging in favorable business activities or financing future operations and capital needs and impair our ability to successfully execute our strategy and operate our business.\nA breach of any of the covenants in our revolving credit agreement would result in an event of default thereunder. Any event of default would permit the creditors to accelerate the related debt, which could also result in the acceleration of any other or future debt containing a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision. In addition, an event of default under our revolving credit agreement would permit the lenders thereunder to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under the revolving credit agreement. Furthermore, if we were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under the revolving credit agreement or any other secured debt we may incur, the lenders thereunder could cause the collateral agent to proceed against the collateral securing that debt. In the event our creditors accelerate the repayment of our debt, there can be no assurance that we would have sufficient assets to repay that debt, and our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations would suffer. Additional information regarding our revolving credit facility is included in Part II, Item 7 \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nThe conditions of the U.S. and international capital markets may adversely affect lenders with which we have relationships, causing us to incur additional costs and reducing our sources of liquidity, which may adversely affect our financial position, liquidity and results of operations.\nIn recent years, there has been turbulence in the global capital markets and the overall economy. Such turbulence can result in disruptions in the financial sector and affect lenders with which we have relationships, including members of the syndicate of banks that are lenders under our revolving credit agreement. Disruptions in the financial sector may increase our exposure to credit risk and adversely affect the ability of lenders to perform under the terms of their lending arrangements with us. Failure by our lenders to perform under the terms of our lending arrangements could cause us to incur additional costs that may adversely affect our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. While overall market conditions have improved, there can be no assurance that future disruptions in the financial sector will not occur that could have similar adverse effects on our business. Additional information regarding our liquidity and related risks is included in Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nWe are exposed to credit risk in our lending activities.\nOur ability to collect on loans to individuals, our single largest asset group, depends on the ability and willingness of our borrowers to repay such loans. Any material adverse change in the ability or willingness of a significant portion of our borrowers to meet their obligations to us, whether due to changes in economic conditions, unemployment rates, the cost of consumer goods (particularly, but not limited to, food and energy costs), disposable income, interest rates, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism, or other causes over which we have no control, would have a material adverse impact on our earnings and financial condition. Although new customers are required to submit a listing of personal property that will serve as collateral to secure their loans, the Company does not rely on the value of such collateral in the loan approval process and generally does not perfect its security interest in that collateral. Additional information regarding our credit risk is included in Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation-Credit Quality.\u201d\nIf our estimates of loan losses are not adequate to absorb actual losses, our provision for loan losses would increase. This would result in a decline in our future revenues and earnings.\nWe maintain an allowance for loan losses for loans we make directly to consumers. This allowance is an estimate. If our actual loan losses exceed the assumption used to establish the allowance, our provision for loan losses would increase, which would result in a decline in our future earnings. Additional information regarding our allowance for loan losses is included in Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Credit Quality.\u201d\nThe concentration of our revenues in certain states could adversely affect us.\nWe currently operate consumer installment loan branches in fifteen states in the United States. Any adverse legislative or regulatory change in any one of our states, but particularly in any of our larger states could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, and results of operation or financial condition. See Part I, Item 1, \"Description of Business\" for information regarding the size of our business in the various states in which we operate.\nWe have goodwill, which is subject to periodic review and testing for impairment.\nA portion of our total assets at March 31, 2015 is comprised of goodwill. Under generally accepted accounting principles, goodwill is subject to periodic review and testing to determine if it is impaired. Unfavorable trends in our industry and unfavorable events or disruptions to our operations resulting from adverse legislative or regulatory actions or from other unpredictable causes could result in significant goodwill impairment charges.\nControls and procedures may fail or be circumvented.\nControls and procedures are particularly important for small-loan consumer finance companies. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system are met. In the second quarter of fiscal 2014, we reported a loss of $1.2 million as the result of a fraud at one of our branches where certain of our controls and procedures were circumvented. Any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe loss, replacement or transition of key management personnel, could cause our business to suffer.\nOur future success significantly depends on the continued services and performance of our key management personnel. Competition for these employees is intense. Additionally, during fiscal 2014, the Company experienced the departure and replacement of its Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer. The loss of, or inability to successfully replace and transition, the services of members of our senior management or key team members or the inability to attract additional qualified personnel as needed could materially harm our business.\nRegular turnover among our managers and other employees at our branches makes it more difficult for us to operate our branches and increases our costs of operations, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe annual turnover as of March 31, 2015 among our branch employees was approximately 34.4%. This turnover increases our cost of operations and makes it more difficult to operate our branches. If we are unable to keep our employee turnover rates consistent with historical levels or if unanticipated problems arise from our high employee turnover, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOur ability to manage our growth may deteriorate, and our ability to execute our growth strategy may be adversely affected.\nOur growth strategy, which is based on opening and acquiring branches in existing and new markets, is subject to significant risks, some of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nthe prevailing laws and regulatory environment of each state in which we operate or seek to operate, and, to the extent applicable, federal laws and regulations, which are subject to change at any time;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain and maintain any regulatory approvals, government permits or licenses that may be required;\n\u2022\nthe degree of competition in new markets and its effect on our ability to attract new customers;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain adequate financing for our expansion plans; and\n\u2022\nour ability to attract, train and retain qualified personnel to staff our new operations.\nWe currently lack product and business diversification; as a result, our revenues and earnings may be disproportionately negatively impacted by external factors and may be more susceptible to fluctuations than more diversified companies.\nOur primary business activity is offering small consumer installment loans together with, in some states in which we operate, related ancillary products. Thus, any developments, whether regulatory, economic or otherwise, that would hinder, reduce the profitability of or limit our ability to operate our small consumer installment loan business on the terms currently conducted would have a direct and adverse impact on our business, profitability and perhaps even our viability. Our current lack of product and business diversification could inhibit our opportunities for growth, reduce our revenues and profits and make us more susceptible to earnings fluctuations than many other financial institutions whose operations are more diversified.\nInterruption of, or a breach in security relating to, our information systems could adversely affect us.\nWe rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business. Each branch is part of an information network that is designed to permit us to maintain adequate cash inventory, reconcile cash balances on a daily basis and report revenues and expenses to our headquarters. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems, including any failure of our back-up systems, cyber attacks, data theft, computer viruses or similar problems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management, general ledger, loan and other systems, loss of confidential Company, customer or vendor information and could result in a loss of customer confidence and business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny or negative publicity, or expose us to civil litigation, financial liability, and increased costs to remediate such problems, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur centralized headquarters functions are susceptible to disruption by catastrophic events, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur headquarters building is located in Greenville, South Carolina. Our information systems and administrative and management processes are primarily provided to our branches from this centralized location, and they could be disrupted if a catastrophic event, such as severe weather, natural disaster, power outage, act of terror or similar event, destroyed or severely damaged our headquarters. Any such catastrophic event or other unexpected disruption of our headquarters functions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAbsence of dividends could reduce our attractiveness to investors.\nSince 1989, we have not declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock and may not pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, our common stock may be less attractive to certain investors than the stock of dividend-paying companies.\nVarious provisions of our charter documents and applicable laws could delay or prevent a change of control that shareholders may favor.\nProvisions of our articles of incorporation, South Carolina law, and the laws in several of the states in which our operating subsidiaries are incorporated could delay or prevent a change of control that the holders of our common stock may favor or may impede the ability of our shareholders to change our management. In particular, our articles of incorporation and South Carolina law, among other things, authorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock in one or more series, without shareholder approval, and will require the affirmative vote of holders of two-thirds of our outstanding shares of voting stock, to approve our merger or consolidation with another corporation. Additional information regarding the similar effect of laws in certain states in which we operate is described in Part 1, Item 1, \u201cDescription of Business - Government Regulation.\u201d\nOverall stock market volatility may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe Company\u2019s common stock price has been and is likely to continue to be subject to significant volatility. A variety of factors could cause the price of the common stock to fluctuate, perhaps substantially, including: general market fluctuations resulting from factors not directly related to the Company\u2019s operations or the inherent value of its common stock; state or federal legislative or regulatory proposals, initiatives, actions or changes that are, or are perceived to be, adverse to our operations or the broader consumer finance industry in general; announcements of developments related to our business; fluctuations in our operating results and the provision for loan losses; low trading volume in our common stock; decreased availability of our common stock resulting from stock repurchases and concentrations of ownership by large or institutional investors; general conditions in the financial service industry, the domestic or global economy or the domestic or global credit or capital markets; changes in financial estimates by securities analysts; our failure to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors; negative commentary regarding our Company and corresponding short-selling market behavior; adverse developments in our relationships with our customers; investigations or legal proceedings brought against the Company or its officers; or significant changes in our senior management team.\nOur use of derivatives exposes us to credit and market risk.\nFrom time to time we may use derivatives to manage our exposure to interest rate risk and foreign currency fluctuations. By using derivative instruments, the Company is exposed to credit and market risk. We can provide no assurance that these strategies will mitigate the impact of increases in interest rates or foreign currency fluctuations. Additional information regarding our exposure to credit and market risk is included in Part II, Item 7A, \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\u201d\nChanges to accounting rules, regulations or interpretations could significantly affect our financial results.\nNew accounting rules or regulations, changes to existing accounting rules or regulations and changing interpretations of existing rules and regulations have and may continue to be issued or occur in the future. Any such changes to accounting rules, regulations or interpretations could negatively affect our reported results of operations and could negatively affect our financial condition through increased cost of compliance.\nA small number of our shareholders have the ability to significantly influence matters requiring shareholder approval and such shareholders have interests which may conflict with the interests of our other security holders.\nAs of March 31, 2015, based on filings made with the SEC and other information made available to us, Prescott General Partners, LLC and its affiliates beneficially owned approximately 27.9% of our common stock. As a result, these few shareholders are able to significantly influence matters presented to shareholders, including the election and removal of directors, the approval of significant corporate transactions, such as any reclassification, reorganization, merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets, and the control of our management and affairs, including executive compensation arrangements. Their interests may conflict with the interests of our other security holders.", "PERMNO": 77114, "SIC": 6141, "TIC": "WRLD"}
