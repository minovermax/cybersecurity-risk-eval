{"cik": "1409375", "company": "ORION ENERGY SYSTEMS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-06-23", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below and in other reports that we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The matters discussed in the following risk factors, and additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation and future growth prospects and could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.\nWe have had a history of losses and we may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability or positive cash flows in the future.\nWe have experienced net losses for the past four years. Generating net income and positive cash flows in the future will depend on our ability to successfully complete and execute our strategic plan. There is no guarantee that we will be able to achieve or sustain profitability or positive cash flows in the future. Our inability to successfully achieve and sustain profitability and positive cash flows may result in us experiencing a serious liquidity deficiency and resulting material adverse consequences that could threaten our viability.\nWe may not be able to obtain equity capital or debt financing necessary to effectively pursue our strategy and sustain our growth initiatives.\nOur existing liquidity and capital resources may not be sufficient to allow us to effectively pursue our strategy or our growth initiatives. Currently, we have limited borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility. As of March 31, 2016, we had approximately $3,719,000 of outstanding borrowings and only $229,000 of borrowing capacity available under our revolving credit facility. If we require additional capital resources, we may not be able to obtain sufficient equity capital and/or debt financing to allow us to continue our normal course of operations or we may not be able to obtain such equity capital or debt financing on acceptable terms or conditions. Factors affecting the availability to us of equity capital or debt financing on acceptable terms and conditions include:\n\u2022\nThe price, volatility and trading volume and history of our common stock.\n\u2022\nOur current and future financial results and position.\n\u2022\nThe market\u2019s view of our company, industry and products.\n\u2022\nThe perception in the equity and debt markets of our ability to execute our business plan or achieve our operating results expectations.\nOur inability to obtain the equity capital or debt financing necessary to pursue our strategy could force us to scale back our operations or our sales initiatives due to the high working capital costs associated with an increase in the sales of our products from existing levels. If we are unable to pursue our strategy and sustain our growth initiatives, our business and operating results will be materially adversely affected.\nWe increasingly rely on third-party manufacturers for the manufacture and development of our products and product components\nWe have increased our utilization of third-party manufacturers for the manufacture and development of our products and product components. Our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows could be materially adversely affected if our manufacturers were to experience problems with product quality, credit or liquidity issues, or disruptions or delays in the manufacturing process or delivery of the finished products and components or the raw materials used to make such products and components.\nWe are increasing our emphasis on indirect distribution channels to sell our products and services. If we are unable to attract, incentivize and retain our third-party distributors and sales agents, our revenues could decline and our costs could increase.\nWe have significantly expanded the number of our manufacturer representative agencies that sell our products through broadline distributors, many of which are not exclusive, which means that these sales agents and distributors may sell other third-party products and services in direct competition with us. Since many of our competitors use sales agents and distributors to sell their products and services, competition for such agents and distributors is intense and may adversely affect our product pricing and gross margins. Additionally, due to mismanagement, industry trends, macro-economic developments, or other reasons, our sales agents and distributors may be unable to effectively sell our products at the levels desired or anticipated. In addition, we have historically relied on direct sales to sell our products, which were often made in competition with sales agents and distributors. In order to attract and form lasting partnerships with sales agents and distributors in the future, we will be required to overcome our historical perception as a direct sales competitor. As a result, we may have difficulty attracting and retaining sales agents and distributors and any inability to do so could have a negative effect on our ability to attract and obtain customers, which could have an adverse impact on our business.\nAdverse conditions in the global economy have negatively impacted, and could continue to negatively impact, our customers, suppliers and business.\nGlobal economic and political uncertainty has led many customers to adopt strategies for conserving cash, including limits on capital spending. Our lighting systems are often purchased as capital assets and therefore are subject to capital availability. Uncertainty around such availability has led customers to delay purchase decisions, which has elongated the duration of our sales cycles. Continued weak economic conditions have adversely affected our customers\u2019 capital budgets, purchasing decisions and facilities managers and, therefore, have adversely affected our results of operations. The return to a recessionary state of the global economy could potentially have negative effects on our near-term liquidity and capital resources, including slower collections of receivables, delays of existing order deliveries and postponements of incoming orders. Our business and results of operations will continue to be adversely affected to the extent these adverse economic conditions continue to affect our customers\u2019 purchasing decisions.\nOur financial performance is dependent on our ability to execute on our strategy and increase our profitability.\nOur ability to achieve our desired growth and profitability depends on our ability to expand our reseller network, develop recurring revenue streams, effectively engage distribution and sales agents and improve our marketing, new product development, project management, margin enhancement and operating expense management, as well as other factors. If we are unable to successfully execute in any of these areas or on our growth and profitability strategy, then our business and financial performance will likely be materially adversely affected.\nIn addition, the gross margins of our products can vary significantly, with margins ranging from 15% to 50%. While we continue to implement our strategy of transitioning to higher-margin products, a change in the total mix of our sales toward lower margin products could reduce our profitability and result in a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry and, if we are unable to compete successfully, our revenue and profitability will be adversely affected.\nWe face strong competition primarily from manufacturers and distributors of energy management products and services, as well as from electrical contractors. We compete primarily on the basis of customer relationships, price, quality, energy efficiency, customer service and marketing support. Our products are in direct competition with HID technology, as well as other HIF and LED products and older fluorescent technology in the lighting systems retrofit market.\nMany of our competitors are better capitalized than we are, have strong customer relationships, greater name recognition, and more extensive engineering, manufacturing, sales and marketing capabilities. Competitors could focus their substantial resources on developing a competing business model or energy management products or services that may be potentially more attractive to customers than our products or services. In addition, we may face competition from other products or technologies that reduce demand for electricity. Our competitors may also offer energy management products and services at reduced prices in order to improve their competitive positions. Any of these competitive factors could make it more difficult for us to attract and\nretain customers, require us to lower our prices in order to remain competitive, and reduce our revenue and profitability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe success of our business depends upon our adaptation to the changing market conditions in the lighting industry and on market acceptance of our lighting retrofit solutions using new LED technologies.\nThe market for lighting products has experienced a significant technology shift to LED lighting systems. As a result, we are focusing our business primarily on providing lighting retrofit solutions using new LED technologies in lieu of traditional HIF lighting upon which our business has historically relied.\nAs a result, our future success depends significantly upon the adoption rate of LED products within our primary markets and our ability to participate in this ongoing market trend. To be an effective participant in this growing LED market opportunity, we must keep up with the evolution of LED technology, which has been moving at a fast pace. We may be unable to successfully develop and market new LED products or services that keep pace with technological or industry changes, satisfy changes in customer demands or comply with present or emerging government and industry regulations and technology standards. The development and introduction of new LED products may result in increased warranty expenses and other new product introduction expenses. In addition, we will likely continue to incur substantial costs to research and develop new LED products, which will increase our expenses, without guarantee that our new products and services will be commercially viable. We may also spend time and resources to develop and release new LED products only to discover that a competitor has also introduced similar new products with superior performance. Moreover, if new sources of lighting are developed, our current products and technologies could become less competitive or obsolete, which could result in reduced revenue, reduced earnings or increased losses and/or inventory and other impairment charges. Additionally, as the lighting retrofit market continues to shift to LED lighting products from HIF and other traditional lighting products, customer purchasing decisions have been delayed as they evaluate the relative advantages and disadvantages of the lighting retrofit product alternatives and wait for further decreases in the price of LED lighting products. These circumstances have led, and may continue to lead, to reduced revenue for us in the periods affected.\nAs we attempt to adapt our business organization to this quickly evolving market, we have been managing through significant change in our vendor supply chain as LED product portfolio and our product revenue continue to increase and we place most of our focus on this product line. We currently believe that our continuing efforts to negotiate further lower material input costs will improve our LED product gross margins. However, we may not be able to realize the gross margin benefits in the amounts or on the timetable anticipated and we may experience higher warranty expenses in the future as we implement our manufacturing and assembly process changes. It is also possible that, as we continue to focus our sales efforts on our LED product lines, we may increase our risk of inventory obsolescence for our legacy lighting product lines or even for outmoded LED products.\nFinally, in connection with our primary focus on selling our LED products, we expect our results of operations to continue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter as customers may continue to delay purchasing decisions as they evaluate their return on investment from purchasing new LED products compared to alternative lighting solutions, the pricing of LED products continues to fall and LED products continue to gain more widespread customer acceptance. Similarly, these circumstances have impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, our product gross margins and our profitability from quarter to quarter.\nIf we are unable to achieve market acceptance of our lighting retrofit solutions using new LED technologies or realize the expected benefits from our emphasis on promoting our LED technologies, our results of operations and financial condition will likely be materially adversely affected.\nThe success of our LED lighting retrofit solutions depend, in part, on our ability to claim market share ahead of our competitors.\nParticipants in the LED market who are able to quickly establish customer relationships and achieve market penetration are likely to gain a competitive advantage as the lighting retrofit solutions offered by us and our competitors generally have a product life of several years following installation. If we are unable to establish customer relationships and achieve market penetration in the LED market in a timely manner, we may lose the opportunity to market our LED products and services to significant portions of the lighting systems retrofit market for several years and may be at a disadvantage in securing future business opportunities from customers that have previously established relationships with one or more of our competitors. These disadvantages could reduce our revenue and profitability, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe success of our business depends upon market acceptance of our energy management products and services.\nOur future success depends on continued commercial acceptance of our energy management products and services. If we are unable to convince current and potential customers of the advantages of our lighting systems and energy management products and services, then our ability to sell our lighting systems and energy management products and services will be limited. In addition, because the market for energy management products and services is rapidly evolving, we may not be able to accurately assess the size of the market, and we may have limited insight into trends that may emerge and affect our business. If the market for our lighting systems and energy management products and services does not continue to develop, or if the market does not accept our\nproducts, then our ability to grow our business could be limited and we may not be able to increase our revenue or achieve profitability.\nWe depend on our ability to develop new products and services.\nThe market for our products and services is characterized by rapid market and technological changes, uncertain product life cycles, changes in customer demands and evolving government, industry and utility standards and regulations. As a result, our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to design and manufacture new products and services. We may be unable to successfully develop and market new products or services that keep pace with technological or industry changes, satisfy changes in customer demands or comply with present or emerging government and industry regulations and technology standards.\nWe are subject to litigation and other legal matters that could result in charges against our income or strain our resources and distract our management, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or reputation.\nWe are involved in a variety of claims, lawsuits and other disputes. These suits concern a variety of issues, including employee-related matters and contract disputes. In March 2014, we were named as a defendant in a civil lawsuit filed by Neal R. Verfuerth, our former chief executive officer who was terminated for cause in November 2012. The plaintiff alleges, among other things, that we breached certain agreements entered into with the plaintiff, including the plaintiff\u2019s employment agreement, and violated certain laws. The complaint seeks, among other relief, unspecified pecuniary and compensatory damages, fees and such other relief as the court may deem just and proper. It is not feasible to predict the outcome of these pending suits and other matters, and the ultimate resolution of these matters, as well as future potential lawsuits, could result in liabilities, fines, significant expenses, distraction of management and other issues that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or reputation.\nOur inability to attract and retain key employees, our reseller network or manufacturer representative agencies could adversely affect our operations and our ability to execute on our operating plan and growth strategy.\nWe rely upon the knowledge, experience and skills of key employees throughout our organization, particularly our senior management team and our sales group that require technical knowledge or contacts in, and knowledge of, the industry. In addition, our ability to attract talented new employees, particularly in our sales group, is also critical to our success. We also depend on our distribution channels and network of manufacturer representative agencies. If we are unable to attract and retain key employees, resellers, and manufacturer representative agencies because of competition or, in the case of employees, inadequate compensation or other factors, our operations and our ability to execute our operating plan could be adversely affected.\nIncreased employee turnover could negatively impact our business.\nWe have recently experienced increased employee turnover. The increased turnover has resulted in the loss of numerous long-term employees, along with their institutional knowledge and expertise, and the reallocation of certain employment responsibilities, all of which could adversely affect operational efficiencies, employee performance and retention. Such turnover has also placed a significant burden on our current employees, has resulted in higher recruiting expenses as we seek to recruit and train employees, and introduced increased instability in our operations as responsibilities are reallocated to new or different employees. To the extent that we are unable to effectively reallocate employee responsibilities, retain key employees and reduce employee turnover, our operations and our ability to execute our operating plan could be adversely affected.\nOur products use components and raw materials that may be subject to price fluctuations, shortages or interruptions of supply.\nWe may be vulnerable to price increases for components or raw materials that we require for our products, including aluminum, copper, certain rare earth minerals, electronic drivers, chips, ballasts, power supplies and lamps. In particular, our cost of aluminum can be subject to commodity price fluctuation. Further, suppliers' inventories of certain components that our products require may be limited and are subject to acquisition by others. In the past, we have had to purchase quantities of certain components that are critical to our product manufacturing and were in excess of our estimated near-term requirements as a result of supplier delivery constraints and concerns over component availability, and we may need to do so in the future. As a result, we have had, and may need to continue, to devote additional working capital to support a large amount of component and raw material inventory that may not be used over a reasonable period to produce saleable products, and we may be required to increase our excess and obsolete inventory reserves to provide for these excess quantities, particularly if demand for our products does not meet our expectations. Also, any shortages or interruptions in supply of our components or raw materials could disrupt our operations. If any of these events occur, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nWe do not have major sources of recurring revenue and depend upon a limited number of customers in any given period to generate a substantial portion of our revenue. The loss of significant customers or a major customer could have an adverse effect on our operations.\nWe do not have long-term contracts with our customers that provide us with recurring revenue from period to period. As a result, we generate a substantial portion of our revenue by securing large retrofit and multi-facility roll-out projects from new and existing customers and our dependence on individual key customers can vary from period to period as a result of the significant size of some of our retrofit and multi-facility roll-out projects. Our top 10 customers accounted for approximately 37%, 36%, and 45% respectively, of our total revenue for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014. In fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2015, our top customer accounted for 23% and 12% of our total revenues, respectively. In fiscal 2016, there was no single customer that accounted for more than 10% of our revenue. While we are making efforts to increase our sources of recurring revenue, we expect large retrofit and roll-out projects to continue to remain a significant component of our total revenue. Additionally, commercial office lighting retrofits provide for single large project opportunities. As a result, we may continue to experience customer concentration in future periods. The loss of, or substantial reduction in sales to, any of our significant customers, or a major customer, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any given future period.\nProduct liability claims could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe face exposure to product liability claims in the event that our energy management products fail to perform as expected or cause bodily injury or property damage. Since virtually all of our products use electricity, it is possible that our products could result in injury, whether by product malfunctions, defects, improper installation or other causes. Particularly because our products often incorporate new technologies or designs, we cannot predict whether or not product liability claims will be brought against us in the future or result in negative publicity about our business or adversely affect our customer relations. Moreover, we may not have adequate resources in the event of a successful claim against us. A successful product liability claim against us that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of our available insurance limits could require us to make significant payments of damages and could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur inability to protect our intellectual property, or our involvement in damaging and disruptive intellectual property litigation, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition or result in the loss of use of the product or service.\nWe attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as employee and third-party nondisclosure and assignment agreements. Our failure to obtain or maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property rights for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe own United States patents and patent applications for some of our products, systems, business methods and technologies. We offer no assurance about the degree of protection which existing or future patents may afford us. Likewise, we offer no assurance that our patent applications will result in issued patents, that our patents will be upheld if challenged, that competitors will not develop similar or superior business methods or products outside the protection of our patents, that competitors will not infringe upon our patents, or that we will have adequate resources to enforce our patents. Effective protection of our United States patents may be unavailable or limited in jurisdictions outside the United States, as the intellectual property laws of foreign countries sometimes offer less protection or have onerous filing requirements. In addition, because some patent applications are maintained in secrecy for a period of time, we could adopt a technology without knowledge of a pending patent application, and such technology could infringe a third party\u2019s patent.\nWe also rely on unpatented proprietary technology. It is possible that others will independently develop the same or similar technology or otherwise learn of our unpatented technology. To protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information, we generally require employees, consultants, advisors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements. We cannot assure you that these agreements will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use, misappropriation or disclosure of such trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information. If we are unable to maintain the proprietary nature of our technologies, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nWe rely on our trademarks, trade names, and brand names to distinguish our company and our products and services from our competitors. Some of our trademarks may conflict with trademarks of other companies. Failure to obtain trademark registrations could limit our ability to protect our trademarks and impede our sales and marketing efforts. Further, we cannot assure you that competitors will not infringe our trademarks, or that we will have adequate resources to enforce our trademarks.\nIn addition, third parties may bring infringement and other claims that could be time-consuming and expensive to defend. Also, parties making infringement and other claims may be able to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief that could effectively block our ability to provide our products, services or business methods and could cause us to pay substantial damages. In the event of a successful claim of infringement, we may need to obtain one or more licenses from third parties, which may not be available at a reasonable cost, or at all. It is possible that our intellectual property rights may not be valid or that we may infringe upon\nexisting or future proprietary rights of others. Any successful infringement claims could subject us to significant liabilities, require us to seek licenses on unfavorable terms, prevent us from manufacturing or selling products, services and business methods and require us to redesign or, in the case of trademark claims, re-brand our company or products, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe are subject to financial and operating covenants in our credit agreement and any failure to comply with such covenants, or obtain waivers in the event of non-compliance, could limit our borrowing availability under the credit agreement, resulting in our being unable to borrow under our credit agreement and other negative consequences.\nOur credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association contains provisions that may limit our future borrowing availability, and may from time to time require us to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. The credit agreement also contains other customary covenants, including certain restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, consolidate or merge, enter into acquisitions, guarantee obligations of third parties, make loans or advances, declare or pay any dividend or distribution on our stock, redeem or repurchase shares of our stock, or pledge or dispose of assets.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with the financial and other covenants in our credit agreement. Our failure to comply with these covenants could cause us to be unable to borrow under the credit agreement and may constitute an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of the maturity of any indebtedness then outstanding under the credit agreement, which would require us to pay all amounts then outstanding. Such an event could materially adversely affect our financial condition and liquidity. Additionally, such events of non-compliance could impact the terms of any additional borrowings and/or any credit renewal terms. Any failure to comply with such covenants would be a disclosable event and may be perceived negatively. Such perception could adversely affect the market price for our common stock and our ability to obtain financing in the future.\nIf our information technology systems fail, or if we experience an interruption in their operation, then our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nThe efficient operation of our business is dependent on our information technology systems. We rely on those systems generally to manage the day-to-day operation of our business, manage relationships with our customers, maintain our research and development data and maintain our financial and accounting records. The failure of our information technology systems, our inability to successfully maintain, enhance and/or replace our information technology systems, or any compromise of the integrity or security of the data we generate from our information technology systems, could adversely affect our results of operations, disrupt our business and product development and make us unable, or severely limit our ability, to respond to customer demands. In addition, our information technology systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from:\n\u2022earthquake, fire, flood and other natural disasters;\n\u2022employee or other theft;\n\u2022attacks by computer viruses or hackers;\n\u2022power outages; and\n\u2022computer systems, internet, telecommunications or data network failure.\nAny interruption of our information technology systems could result in decreased revenue, increased expenses, increased capital expenditures, customer dissatisfaction and potential lawsuits, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nOur retrofitting process frequently involves responsibility for the removal and disposal of components containing hazardous materials.\nWhen we retrofit a customer\u2019s facility, we typically assume responsibility for removing and disposing of its existing lighting fixtures. Certain components of these fixtures typically contain trace amounts of mercury and other hazardous materials. Older components may also contain trace amounts of polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs. We currently rely on contractors to remove the components containing such hazardous materials at the customer job site. The contractors then arrange for the disposal of such components at a licensed disposal facility. Failure by such contractors to remove or dispose of the components containing these hazardous materials in a safe, effective and lawful manner could give rise to liability for us, or could expose our workers or other persons to these hazardous materials, which could result in claims against us which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows or reputation.\nThe cost of compliance with environmental laws and regulations and any related environmental liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nOur operations are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing, among other things, emissions to air, discharge to water, the remediation of contaminated properties and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of, and exposure to, waste and other materials, as well as laws and regulations relating to occupational health and safety. These laws and regulations frequently change, and the violation of these laws or regulations can lead to substantial fines, penalties\nand other liabilities. The operation of our manufacturing facility entails risks in these areas and there can be no assurance that we will not incur material costs or liabilities in the future which could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nWe expect our quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate. If we fail to meet the expectations of market analysts or investors, the market price of our common stock could decline substantially, and we could become subject to securities litigation.\nOur quarterly revenue and operating results have fluctuated in the past and will likely vary from quarter to quarter in the future. The results of one quarter are not an indication of our future performance. Our revenue and operating results may fall below the expectations of market analysts or investors in some future quarter or quarters. Our failure to meet these expectations could cause the market price of our common stock to decline substantially. If the price of our common stock is volatile or falls significantly below our current price, we may be the target of securities litigation. If we become involved in this type of litigation, regardless of the outcome, we could incur substantial legal costs, management\u2019s attention could be diverted from the operation of our business, and our reputation could be damaged, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nOur net operating loss carryforwards provide a future benefit only if we are profitable and may be subject to limitation based upon ownership changes.\nWe have significant federal net operating loss carryforwards and state net operating loss carryforwards. While our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards are fully reserved for, if we are unable to return to and maintain profitability, we may not be able to fully utilize these tax benefits. Furthermore, generally a change of more than 50% in the ownership of a company\u2019s stock, by value, over a three-year period constitutes an ownership change for federal income tax purposes. An ownership change may limit a company\u2019s ability to use its net operating loss carryforwards attributable to the period prior to such change. We believe that past issuances and transfers of our stock caused an ownership change in fiscal 2007 that may affect the timing of the use of our net operating loss carryforwards, but we do not believe the ownership change affects the use of the full amount of our net operating loss carryforwards. As a result, our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards attributable to the period prior to such ownership change to offset taxable income will be subject to limitations in a particular year, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability for us.\nOur failure to establish and maintain internal controls over financial reporting could harm our business and financial results.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that we would prevent or detect a misstatement of our financial statements or fraud. In fiscal 2012, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our internal controls were not effective due to certain identified material weaknesses, which were remediated during fiscal 2013. Additionally, as of March 31, 2016, we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as a result of our insufficient review of non-routine revenue transactions and the related accounting entries. A material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. We are actively engaged in developing a remediation plan designed to address this material weakness. If the remedial measures are insufficient to address this material weakness or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in the internal control are discovered or occur in the future, our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and Orion could be required to restate its financial results. The failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and in a timely manner or to detect and prevent fraud and could also cause a loss of investor confidence and decline in the market price of our common stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not continue to publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will continue to depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If these analysts do not continue to provide adequate research coverage or if one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nThe market price of our common stock could be adversely affected by future sales of our common stock in the public market by us or our executive officers and directors.\nWe and executive officers and directors may from time to time sell shares of our common stock in the public market or otherwise. We cannot predict the size or the effect, if any, that future sales of shares of our common stock by us or our executive officers and directors, or the perception of such sales, would have on the market price of our common stock.\nWe may not be able to maintain compliance with The NASDAQ Capital Market\u2019s continued listing requirements.\nOur common stock is listed on The NASDAQ Capital Market. In order to maintain the listing of our common stock on The NASDAQ Capital Market, we must meet minimum financial, and other requirements, including requirements that our common stock maintains a minimum price per share of $1.00. As of June 10, 2016 the closing price per share of our common stock was $1.27. If the price of our common stock were to fall below $1.00 for 30 or more consecutive business days, we would no longer be in compliance with the continued listing requirements of The NASDAQ Capital Market and may be required to take steps to satisfy the minimum price per share requirement, including calling a special meeting of our shareholders to approve a reverse stock split. A potential delisting of our common stock could adversely affect the market liquidity of our common stock, our ability to obtain financing and our ability to fund our operations.\nWe are not currently paying dividends and will likely continue not paying dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never paid or declared any cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings to fund the development and expansion of our business, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. In addition, the terms of our existing revolving credit agreement restrict the payment of cash dividends on our common stock. Any future determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant. The restriction on and decision not to pay dividends may impact our ability to attract investors and raise funds, if necessary, in the capital markets.\nAnti-takeover provisions included in the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law, provisions in our amended and restated articles of incorporation or bylaws and the common share purchase rights that accompany shares of our common stock could delay or prevent a change of control of our company, which could adversely impact the value of our common stock and may prevent or frustrate attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove our current board of directors or management.\nA change of control of our company may be discouraged, delayed or prevented by certain provisions of the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law. These provisions generally restrict a broad range of business combinations between a Wisconsin corporation and a shareholder owning 15% or more of our outstanding common stock. These and other provisions in our amended and restated articles of incorporation, including our staggered board of directors and our ability to issue \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, as well as the provisions of our amended and restated bylaws and Wisconsin law, could make it more difficult for shareholders or potential acquirers to obtain control of our board of directors or initiate actions that are opposed by the then-current board of directors, including to delay or impede a merger, tender offer or proxy contest involving our company.\nEach currently outstanding share of our common stock includes, and each newly issued share of our common stock will include, a common share purchase right. The rights are attached to, and trade with, the shares of common stock and generally are not exercisable. The rights will become exercisable if a person or group acquires, or announces an intention to acquire, 20% or more of our outstanding common stock. The rights have some anti-takeover effects and generally will cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire control of us without conditioning the offer on either redemption of the rights or amendment of the rights to prevent this dilution.
