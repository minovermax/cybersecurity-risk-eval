{"cik": "1722684", "company": "WYNDHAM HOTELS & RESORTS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-02-14", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nRISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider each of the following risk factors and all of the other information set forth in this report. The risk factors generally have been separated into three groups: risks relating to our business and industry, risks relating to the spin-off and risks relating to our common stock. Based on the information currently known to us, we believe that the following information identifies the most significant risk factors affecting our Company in each of these categories of risks. However, the risks and uncertainties we face are not limited to those set forth in the risk factors described below. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business. In addition, past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\nIf any of the following risks and uncertainties develops into actual events, these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Industry\nThe hotel industry is highly competitive and we are subject to risks related to competition that may adversely affect our performance and growth.\nWe will be adversely impacted if we cannot compete effectively in the highly competitive hotel industry. Our continued success depends upon our ability to compete effectively in markets that contain numerous competitors, some of whom may have significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources than we have. Competition in the hotel industry is based primarily on brand name recognition and reputation, as well as location, room rates, property size and availability of rooms and conference space, quality of the accommodations, guest satisfaction, amenities and the ability to earn and redeem loyalty program points. We compete with other hotel franchisors for franchisees and we may not be able to grow our franchise system. New hotels may be constructed and these additions to supply create new competitors, in some cases without corresponding increases in demand for lodging. Competition may reduce fee structures, potentially causing us to lower our fees, which may adversely impact our profits. New competition or existing competition that employs a business model that is different from our business model may require us to change our model so that we can remain competitive.\nWe are subject to business, financial, operating and other risks common to the hotel, hotel franchising and hotel management industries and which affect our franchisees, any of which could reduce our revenues and growth.\nA significant portion of our revenue is derived from fees based on room revenues at hotels franchised under our hotel brands. As such, our business is subject, directly or through our franchisees, to risks common in the hotel, hotel franchising and hotel management industries, including risks related to:\n\u2022\nour ability to meet our objectives for growth in the number of our franchised hotels, hotel rooms in our franchise system and hotels under management and to retain franchisees and hotel management contracts;\n\u2022\nthe number, occupancy and room rates of hotels operating under our franchise and management agreements;\n\u2022\nthe delay of hotel openings in our pipeline;\n\u2022\nthe supply and demand for hotel rooms;\n\u2022\nour ability to develop and maintain positive relations and contractual arrangements with current and potential franchisees and hotel owners under our hotel management agreements;\n\u2022\ncompetition from other franchised hotel brands, which may require us to offer terms to prospective franchisees and hotel owners less favorable to us than current franchise agreements;\n\u2022\nour franchisees\u2019 pricing decisions, which may indirectly affect our revenues;\n\u2022\nthe quality of the services provided by franchisees, which may adversely affect our image, reputation and brand value for both prospective guests and prospective franchisees and hotel owners;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully market our rewards program and the level of participation in the program by our franchisees and guests;\n\u2022\nthe bankruptcy or insolvency of a significant number of our franchised or managed hotels, which could impair our ability to collect outstanding fees or other amounts due or otherwise exercise our contractual rights and result in the early termination of our contracts;\n\u2022\nthe availability of financing to allow prospective franchisees to build new hotels;\n\u2022\nfinancial difficulties of franchisees, owners or other developers that have development advance notes with us or who have received loans or other financial incentives from us;\n\u2022\ndisputes with franchisees, which may result in litigation and the loss of management contracts;\n\u2022\nthe failure of our franchisees to make investments necessary to maintain or improve their properties;\n\u2022\nadverse events occurring at one of our franchisees\u2019 locations, such as personal injuries, food tampering, contamination or the spread of illness;\n\u2022\nnegative publicity from online social media postings and related media reports, which could damage our hotel brands;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully market our hotel brands, programs or service or pilot new initiatives;\n\u2022\nour management contract with CorePoint Lodging, Inc. (\u201cCorePoint\u201d), which in aggregate owns approximately 71% of our managed hotels;\n\u2022\nthe laws, regulations and legislation internationally and domestically, and on a federal, state or local level, concerning the franchise or hotel industry, which may make franchising or managing hotels more onerous, more expensive or less profitable;\n\u2022\nour failure to adequately protect and maintain our trademarks and other intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\ncompetition from short-term online rental properties and agencies;\n\u2022\nthe relative mix of branded hotels in the various hotel industry price categories;\n\u2022\ncorporate budgets and spending and cancellations, deferrals or renegotiations of group business;\n\u2022\nseasonal volatility in our business;\n\u2022\noperating costs, including as a result of inflation, energy costs and labor costs such as minimum wage increases and unionization, workers\u2019 compensation and health-care related costs and insurance;\n\u2022\nour ability to keep pace with technological developments, which could impair our competitive position;\n\u2022\ndisruptions, including non-renewal or termination of agreements, in relationships with third parties; including marketing alliances and affiliations with e-commerce channels; and\n\u2022\ndisputes concerning our operations, including consumer disputes, organized labor activities, class actions and associated litigation.\nAny of these factors could reduce our revenues, increase our costs or otherwise limit our opportunities for growth.\nDeclines in or disruptions to the travel industry, such as those caused by economic conditions, terrorism, political strife, pandemics or threats of pandemics, acts of God and war, may adversely affect us.\nDeclines in or disruptions to the travel and hotel industries may adversely impact us. Risks affecting the travel and hotel industries include: economic slowdown and recession; economic factors such as increased costs of living and reduced discretionary income adversely impacting decisions by consumers and businesses to use travel accommodations; terrorist incidents and threats and associated heightened travel security measures; political and regional strife; acts of God such as\nearthquakes, hurricanes, fires, floods, volcanoes and other natural disasters; war; concerns with or threats of pandemics, contagious diseases or health epidemics; environmental disasters; lengthy power outages; increased pricing, financial instability and capacity constraints of air carriers; airline job actions and strikes; and increases in gasoline and other fuel prices. Any such disruptions to the travel or hotel industries may adversely affect our franchised hotels, the operations of current and potential franchisees, developers and owners of hotels with which we have hotel management contracts.\nThird-party Internet reservation systems, peer-to-peer online networks and alternative lodging channels may adversely impact us.\nConsumers increasingly use third-party Internet travel intermediaries and peer-to-peer online networks to search for and book their lodging accommodations. As the percentage of internet reservations increases, travel intermediaries may be able to obtain higher commissions and reduced room rates to the detriment of our business. Additionally, such travel intermediaries may divert reservations away from our direct online channels or increase the overall cost of Internet reservations for our affiliated hotels through their fees. As the use of these third-party reservation channels and peer-to-peer online networks increases, consumers may rely on these channels, adversely impacting our hotel brands, reservations and rates. In addition, if we fail to reach satisfactory agreements with intermediaries, our affiliated hotels may not appear on their websites and we could lose business as a result.\nIn addition to competing with traditional hotels and lodging facilities, our franchisees compete with alternative lodging channels, including third-party providers of short-term rental properties and serviced apartments. Increasing use of these alternative lodging channels could materially adversely affect the occupancy and/or average rates at franchised hotels and our revenues.\nWe may be unable to enter into new, or renew existing, hotel management arrangements on favorable terms or at all, and certain of our management agreements require that we fund shortfalls, any of which could reduce our revenue and the growth of our hotel management business.\nWe provide hotel management services to certain of our hotel owners. Our current and future management arrangements may not continue and we may not be able to enter into new management arrangements in the future on favorable terms. Some of our management contracts with hotel owners require that we compensate the hotel owners for any shortfalls over the life of the management agreement up to a specified aggregate amount if the hotels do not attain specified levels of operating profit or owners do not receive a guaranteed minimum income. We may not be able to recover any funding of such performance guarantees. Any such factors could reduce our revenue and the growth of our hotel management business.\nThe anticipated benefits of the acquisition of La Quinta\u2019s hotel franchising and management businesses may not be realized fully and may take longer to realize than expected.\nThe acquisition of La Quinta\u2019s hotel franchising and management businesses involves the integration of two companies that have previously operated independently. The integration of the two companies may not result in the realization of the full benefits of synergies, cost savings, innovation and operational efficiencies that we expect to realize or these benefits may not be achieved within a reasonable period of time.\nThe difficulties of integration include: integrating the acquired hotel franchising and management businesses of La Quinta into Wyndham Hotels; implementing our business plan for the combined company; integrating information, communications and other systems and internal controls over accounting and financial reporting; consolidating corporate and administrative functions; conforming standards, controls, procedures and policies, business cultures and compensation structures between Wyndham Hotels and La Quinta\u2019s hotel franchising and management businesses; retaining franchisees; establishing a mutually beneficial relationship with CorePoint; and retaining key personnel.\nOur ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the La Quinta acquisition will depend in part on our relationship with CorePoint.\nIn connection with the La Quinta acquisition, we have entered into agreements with CorePoint that will govern the ongoing relationships between CorePoint and us. These agreements, among other things, include arrangements with respect to employee matters, tax matters, transitional services and hotel management and franchise matters, as well as the allocations of assets and liabilities, rights and indemnification and other obligations between us and CorePoint. Our success will depend, in part, on the maintenance of these relationships with CorePoint and its performance of its obligations under these agreements. If we are unable to maintain a good relationship with CorePoint, if it does not perform its obligations under these agreements or does not renew such agreements following their expiration, or if the CorePoint spin-off exposes us to liabilities and legal proceedings, our profitability and revenues could decrease, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the La Quinta acquisition and our growth potential may be adversely affected.\nOur success depends in part on Wyndham Destinations\u2019 sales of vacation membership interests and our ongoing relationship with Wyndham Destinations.\nIn connection with the spin-off, we entered into a number of agreements with Wyndham Destinations that govern our ongoing relationship with Wyndham Destinations. Our success depends, in part, on the maintenance of our ongoing relationship with Wyndham Destinations, Wyndham Destinations\u2019 performance of its obligations under these agreements, including Wyndham Destinations\u2019 maintenance of the quality of products and services it sells under the \u201cWyndham\u201d trademark, and certain other trademarks and intellectual property that we license to Wyndham Destinations. Under the license, development and noncompetition agreement, Wyndham Destinations pays us significant royalties and other fees based on the volume of Wyndham Destinations\u2019 sales of vacation ownership interests and other vacation products and services. Wyndham Destinations competes with other vacation ownership companies for sales of vacation ownership interests based on resort locations, quality of accommodations and service, price, financing availability, ability to exchange for time at other resorts, and brand name recognition and reputation. If Wyndham Destinations is unable to compete effectively for sales of vacation ownership interests, our royalty fees under the license, development and non-competition agreement could be adversely impacted. If we are unable to maintain a good relationship with Wyndham Destinations, or if Wyndham Destinations does not perform its obligations under these agreements, fails to maintain the quality of the products and services it sells under the \u201cWyndham\u201d trademark and certain other trademarks or fails to pay such royalties, our earnings could decrease.\nOur international operations are subject to additional risks not generally applicable to our domestic operations.\nOur international operations are subject to numerous risks including: exposure to local economic conditions; potential adverse changes in the diplomatic relations of foreign countries with the United States; hostility from local populations; political instability, including potential disruptions from the United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the European Union, trade disputes with China and other geopolitical risks; threats or acts of terrorism; the effect of disruptions caused by severe weather, natural disasters, outbreak of disease or other events that make travel to a particular region less attractive or more difficult; the presence and acceptance of varying levels of business corruption in international markets; restrictions and taxes on the withdrawal of foreign investment and earnings; government policies against businesses or properties owned by foreigners; investment restrictions or requirements; diminished ability to legally enforce our contractual rights in foreign countries; forced nationalization of hotel properties by local, state or national governments; foreign exchange restrictions; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; conflicts between local laws and U.S. laws including laws that impact our rights to protect our intellectual property; withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries; and changes in and application of foreign taxation structures including value added taxes. Any adverse outcome resulting from the financial instability or performance of foreign economies, the instability of other currencies and the related volatility on foreign exchange and interest rates could impact our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\nChanges in U.S. federal, state and local or foreign tax law, interpretations of existing tax law or adverse determinations by tax authorities could increase our tax burden or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are subject to taxation at the federal, state and local levels in the United States and various other countries and jurisdictions. Our future effective tax rate and cash flows could be affected by changes in the composition of earnings in jurisdictions with differing tax rates, changes in statutory rates and other legislative changes, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in determinations regarding the jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax, and our ability to repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions. From time to time, U.S. federal, state and local and foreign governments make substantive changes to tax rules and their application, which could result in materially higher corporate taxes than would be incurred under existing tax law and could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. We are subject to ongoing and periodic tax audits and disputes in U.S. federal and various state, local and foreign jurisdictions. An unfavorable outcome from any tax audit could result in higher tax costs, penalties and interest, thereby adversely affecting our financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition, we are directly and indirectly affected by new tax legislation and regulation and the interpretation of tax laws and regulations worldwide. Changes in such legislation, regulation or interpretation could increase our taxes and have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. This includes potential changes in tax laws or the interpretation of tax laws arising out of the Base Erosion Profit Shifting project initiated by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development.\nWe are subject to risks related to our debt, hedging transactions, the cost and availability of capital and the extension of credit by us.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had aggregate outstanding debt of $2,141 million. Since the consummation of the spin-off, we have been responsible for servicing our own debt and obtaining and maintaining sufficient working capital and other funds to satisfy our cash requirements. Our debt instruments contain restrictions, covenants and events of default that, among other things, could limit our ability to respond to market conditions, provide for capital investment needs or take advantage of business opportunities by restricting our ability to incur or guarantee additional debt or requiring us to offer to repurchase our debt in the event of a change of control or a change of control triggering event; pay dividends or make distributions; make investments or acquisitions; sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of certain assets; create liens; consolidate or merge; enter into transactions with affiliates; and prepay and repurchase or redeem certain indebtedness. We may also incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. If we incur additional debt, the risks related to our debt may intensify.\nWe extend credit when we provide development advance notes and mezzanine or other forms of subordinated financing to assist franchisees and hotel owners in converting to or building a new hotel under one of our hotel brands. We may use financial instruments to reduce or hedge our financial exposure to the effects of currency and interest rate fluctuations. In connection with our debt obligations, hedging transactions, the cost and availability of capital and the extension of credit by us, we are subject to numerous risks including:\n\u2022\nour cash flows from operations or available lines of credit may be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest, which could result in a default and acceleration of the underlying debt and under other debt instruments that contain cross-default provisions;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to comply with the terms of the financial covenants under our debt instruments which could result in a default and acceleration of the underlying debt and under other debt instruments that contain cross-default provisions;\n\u2022\nour leverage may adversely affect our ability to obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all;\n\u2022\nour leverage may require the dedication of a significant portion of our cash flows to the payment of principal and interest, thus reducing the availability of cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases and other operating needs;\n\u2022\nincreases in interest rates may adversely affect our financing costs and result in increases in our hedging costs;\n\u2022\nrating agency downgrades of our debt could increase our borrowing costs and prevent us from obtaining additional financing on favorable terms or at all;\n\u2022\nfailure or non-performance of counterparties to foreign exchange and interest rate hedging transactions could result in losses; and\n\u2022\nthe inability of franchisees that have received mezzanine and other loans from us to pay back such loans.\nOur access to credit and capital also depends in large measure on market liquidity factors, which we do not control. Our ability to access the credit and capital markets may be restricted at times when we require or want access, which could impact our business plans and operating model. Uncertainty or volatility in the equity and credit markets may also negatively affect our ability to access short-term and long-term financing on reasonable terms or at all, which would negatively impact our liquidity and financial condition. In addition, if one or more of the financial institutions that support our credit facilities fail, we may not be able to find a replacement, which would negatively impact our ability to borrow under the credit facilities. Disruptions in the financial markets may adversely affect our credit rating and the market value of our common stock. While we believe we have adequate sources of liquidity to meet our anticipated requirements for working capital, debt service and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future, if we are unable to refinance or repay our outstanding debt when due, our results of operations and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected.\nChanges to estimates or projections used to assess the fair value of our assets or operating results that are lower than our current estimates may cause us to incur impairment losses and require us to write-off all or a portion of the remaining value of our goodwill or other intangibles of companies we have acquired.\nOur total assets include goodwill and other intangible assets. We evaluate our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or at other times during the year if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value is below the carrying value. We may be required to record a significant non-cash impairment charge in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill, other intangible assets or other assets is determined, negatively impacting our results of operations and stockholders\u2019 equity.\nAcquisitions and other strategic transactions may not prove successful and could result in operating difficulties and failure to realize anticipated benefits.\nWe regularly consider a wide array of acquisitions and other potential strategic transactions, including acquisitions of hotel brands, businesses and real property, joint ventures, business combinations, strategic investments and dispositions. Any of these transactions could be material to our business. We often compete for these opportunities with third parties, which may cause us to lose potential opportunities or to pay more than we may otherwise have paid absent such competition. We may not be able to identify and consummate strategic transactions and opportunities on favorable terms and any such strategic transactions or opportunities, if consummated, may not be successful.\nWe are subject to risks related to litigation.\nWe are subject to a number of claims and legal proceedings and the risk of future litigation as described in this report. We cannot predict with certainty the ultimate outcome and related liability and costs of litigation and other proceedings filed by or against us. Unfavorable rulings or outcomes in litigation and other proceedings may materially harm our business.\nOur operations are subject to extensive regulation and the cost of compliance or failure to comply with regulations may adversely affect us.\nOur operations are regulated by federal, state and local governments in the countries in which we operate. In addition, U.S. and international federal, state and local regulators may enact new laws and regulations that may reduce our revenues, cause our expenses to increase or require us to modify our business practices substantially. If we are not in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including, among others, those governing franchising, hotel operations, lending, information security, data protection and privacy (including the General Data Protection Regulation), credit card security standards, marketing, sales, consumer protection and advertising, unfair and deceptive trade practices, fraud, bribery and corruption, telemarketing (including do-not-call and call-recording regulations), licensing, labor, employment, anti-discrimination, health care, health and safety, accessibility, immigration, gaming, environmental, intellectual property, securities, stock exchange listing, accounting, tax and regulations applicable under the Dodd-Frank Act, the Office of Foreign Asset Control, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Sherman Act, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local equivalents in international jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom Bribery Act, we may be subject to regulatory investigations or actions, fines, civil and/or criminal penalties, injunctions and potential criminal prosecution.\nWhile we continue to monitor all such laws and regulations, the cost of compliance with such laws and regulations impacts our operating costs. Future changes to such laws and regulations and the cost of compliance or failure to comply with such regulations may adversely affect us.\nFailure to maintain the security of personally identifiable and proprietary information, non-compliance with our contractual obligations regarding such information or a violation of our privacy and security policies with respect to such information could adversely affect us.\nIn connection with our business, we and our service providers collect and retain large volumes of certain types of personal and proprietary information pertaining to guests, stockholders and employees. Such information includes, but is not limited to, large volumes of guest credit and payment card information. We are at risk of attack by cyber-criminals operating on a global basis attempting to gain access to such information. In connection with data security incidents involving a group of Wyndham brand hotels that occurred between 2008 and 2010, one of our subsidiaries is subject to a stipulated order with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the \u201cFTC\u201d), pursuant to which, among other things, it is required to maintain an information security program for payment card information within its network, and which provides it with a safe harbor provided it continues to meet certain requirements for reasonable data security as outlined in the stipulated order.\nWhile we maintain what we believe are reasonable security controls over personal and proprietary information, including the personal information of guests, stockholders and employees, a breach of or breakdown in our systems that results in the unauthorized release of personal or proprietary information could nevertheless occur or our subsidiary could fail to comply with the stipulated order with the FTC, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our hotel brands, reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as subject us to significant regulatory actions and fines, litigation, losses, third-party damages and other liabilities. Such a breach or a breakdown could also materially increase our costs to protect such information and to protect against such risks.\nAdditionally, the legal and regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy in the U.S. and international jurisdictions is constantly evolving. Should we violate or not comply with any of these laws or regulations,\ncontractual requirements relating to data security and privacy, or with our own privacy and security policies, either intentionally or unintentionally, or through the acts of intermediaries, it could have a material adverse effect on our hotel brands, reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as subject us to significant fines, litigation, losses, third-party damages and other liabilities.\nOur information technology infrastructure, including but not limited to our, and our third-party service providers\u2019, information systems and legacy proprietary online reservation and management systems, may be vulnerable to system failures, computer hacking, cyber-terrorism, computer viruses and other intentional or unintentional interference, negligence, fraud, misuse and other unauthorized attempts to access or interfere with these systems and our personal and proprietary information. The increased scope and complexity of our information technology infrastructure and systems could contribute to the potential risk of security breaches or breakdown.\nWe rely on information technologies and systems to operate our business, which involves reliance on third-party service providers and on uninterrupted operation of service facilities.\nWe rely on information technologies and systems to operate our business, which involves reliance on third-party service providers and uninterrupted operations of service facilities, including those used for reservation systems, hotel/property management, communications, procurement, call centers, operation of our loyalty programs and administrative systems. We also maintain physical facilities to support these systems and related services. Any natural disaster, disruption or other impairment in our technology capabilities and service facilities or those of our vendors could harm our business. Any failure of our ability to provide our reservation systems may deter prospective franchisees or hotel owners from entering into agreements with us, and may expose us to liability from existing franchisees or other parties with whom we have contracted to provide reservation services. As we transition from our legacy systems to new, cloud-based technologies, we may face start-up issues that may negatively impact guests. In addition, failure to keep pace with developments in technology could impair our operations or competitive position.\nWe are dependent on our senior management and the loss of any member of our senior management could harm our business.\nWe believe that our future growth depends in part on the continued services of our senior management team. Losing the services of any members of our senior management team could adversely affect our strategic relationships and impede our ability to execute our business strategies. The market for qualified individuals may be highly competitive and finding and recruiting suitable replacements for senior management may be difficult, time-consuming and costly.\nThe insurance we carry may not always pay, or be sufficient to pay or reimburse us, for our liabilities, losses or replacement costs.\nWe carry insurance for general liability, property, business interruption and other insurable risks with respect to our business and franchised, managed and owned hotels. We also self-insure for certain risks up to certain monetary limits. The terms and conditions or the amounts of coverage of our insurance may not at all times be sufficient to pay or reimburse us for the amount of our liabilities, losses or replacement costs, and there may also be risks for which we do not obtain insurance in the full amount or any amount concerning a potential loss or liability, or at all, due to the cost or availability of such insurance. As a result, we may incur liabilities or losses in the operation of our business that are substantial, which are not sufficiently covered by the insurance we maintain, or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to risks related to corporate social responsibility.\nMany factors influence our reputation and the value of our hotel brands including the perception held by guests, our franchisees, our other key stakeholders and the communities in which we do business. Our business faces increasing scrutiny related to environmental, social and governance activities and the risk of damage to our reputation and the value of our hotel brands if we fail to act responsibly or comply with regulatory requirements in a number of areas, such as safety and security, responsible tourism, environmental stewardship, supply chain management, climate change, modern slavery, diversity, human rights, philanthropy and support for local communities.\nRisks Relating to the Spin-Off\nWe may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve from our spin-off from Wyndham Destinations.\nAs a result of our separation from Wyndham Destinations we may be more susceptible to market fluctuations and other adverse events than we would have been were we still a part of Wyndham Destinations. If we fail to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve as an independent company, or do not achieve them in the time we expect, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nWe have a limited operating history as a separate public company, our financial information from before the spin-off from Wyndham Destinations may not reflect our current or future results as an independent company, we may not be able to make, on a timely or cost-effective basis, the changes necessary to operate as an independent company and, as a result, we may experience increased costs.\nPrior to the spin-off, Wyndham Destinations performed various corporate functions for us, including tax administration, governance, compliance, accounting, internal audit and external reporting. Our historical financial results reflect allocations of corporate expenses from Wyndham Destinations for these and similar functions that may be less than the comparable expenses we would have incurred had we operated as a separate publicly traded company. Prior to the spin-off, we shared with Wyndham Destinations economies of scope and scale in costs, employees, vendor relationships and relationships with our guests. Although we entered into transition agreements and licensing, marketing and other agreements that govern certain commercial and other relationships between us and Wyndham Destinations, those arrangements may not capture the benefits our business enjoyed as a result of being integrated with the other businesses of Wyndham Destinations prior to the spin-off.\nGenerally, our working capital requirements, including acquisitions and capital expenditures, were satisfied as part of the corporate-wide cash management policies of Wyndham Destinations before the spin-off. Since the completion of the spin-off, Wyndham Destinations has not and will not be providing us with funds to finance our working capital or other cash requirements, and we may need to obtain financing from banks, through public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities, strategic relationships or other arrangements. We may be unable to replace in a timely manner or on comparable terms and costs the services or other benefits that Wyndham Destinations previously provided to us.\nThe loss of the benefits from being a part of Wyndham Destinations could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Other significant changes may occur in our cost structure, management, financing and business operations as a result of our operating as a company separate from Wyndham Destinations.\nWe may have received better terms from unaffiliated third parties than the terms we received in our agreements with Wyndham Destinations entered into in connection with the spin-off.\nWe entered into agreements with Wyndham Destinations related to the spin-off while we were still part of Wyndham Destinations. Accordingly, these agreements may not reflect terms that would have resulted from arm\u2019s-length negotiations among unaffiliated third parties and we may have received better terms from third parties because third parties may have competed with each other to secure our business.\nOur failure to maintain effective internal controls or meet the financial reporting and other requirements to which we are now subject could have a material adverse effect on our business and the price of our common stock.\nAs a result of the spin-off, we are subject to reporting and other obligations under U.S. securities laws and are required to comply with applicable internal controls and reporting requirements. Effective internal and disclosure controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud and to operate successfully as a public company. If we are unable to maintain adequate financial and management controls, reporting systems, information technology systems and procedures, our ability to comply with the financial reporting requirements and other rules that apply to reporting companies under U.S. securities laws may be impaired. Ineffective internal and disclosure controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which would likely have a negative effect on the per share trading price of our common stock.\nIn connection with the spin-off and Wyndham Destinations\u2019 sale of its European vacation rentals business, we agreed to indemnify Wyndham Destinations and Wyndham Destinations, agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities, and if we are required to perform under these indemnities or if Wyndham Destinations is unable to satisfy its obligations under these indemnities, our financial results could be negatively affected.\nIn connection with the spin-off, Wyndham Destinations agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities, and we agreed to indemnify Wyndham Destinations for certain liabilities, including cross-indemnities that are principally designed to place financial responsibility for the obligations and liabilities of our business with us, and financial responsibility for the obligations and liabilities of Wyndham Destinations\u2019 business with Wyndham Destinations. Should our indemnification obligations exceed applicable insurance coverage, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Additionally, the indemnities from Wyndham Destinations may not be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of these and other liabilities. Third parties also could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that Wyndham Destinations has agreed to assume. Even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from Wyndham Destinations any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear those losses ourselves. Each of these risks could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn May 2018, Wyndham Destination Network, LLC, a subsidiary of Wyndham Destinations, Inc., completed the sale of Wyndham Destinations\u2019 European vacation rentals business. In connection with the sale of the European vacation rentals business, we provided certain post-closing credit support in the form of guarantees, which as of December 31, 2018 were approximately $130 million, to ensure that the business meets the requirements of certain service providers and regulatory authorities. Such post-closing credit support may be enforced or called upon if the European vacation rentals business fails to meet its primary obligation to pay certain amounts when due. The European vacation rentals business has provided an indemnity to Wyndham Destinations in the event that the post-closing credit support is enforced or called upon. Pursuant to the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement that was entered into in connection with the spin-off, we assumed one-third and Wyndham Destinations assumed two-thirds of any such losses actually incurred by Wyndham Destinations or us in the event that these credit support arrangements are enforced or called upon by any beneficiary and any amounts paid or received by Wyndham Destinations or us in respect of any indemnification claims made in connection with the sale of the European vacation rentals business.\nThe contingent liabilities we assumed in connection with the spin-off and Wyndham Destinations\u2019 sale of its European vacation rental business could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe contingent liabilities we assumed in connection with the spin-off and Wyndham Destinations\u2019 sale of its European vacation rental business could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement, we assumed one-third and Wyndham Destinations assumed two-thirds of certain contingent and other corporate liabilities of Wyndham Destinations, which we refer to in this Report as \u201cshared contingent liabilities,\u201d incurred prior to the spin-off, including liabilities of Wyndham Destinations related to, arising out of or resulting from certain terminated or divested businesses, certain general corporate matters of Wyndham Destinations and any actions with respect to the spin-off brought by any third party. Similarly, in connection with the sale of Wyndham Destinations\u2019 European vacation rental business, Wyndham Hotels assumed one-third and Wyndham Destinations assumed two-thirds of certain shared contingent liabilities and certain shared contingent assets. Such shared contingent assets and shared contingent liabilities include: any amounts paid or received by Wyndham Destinations or us in respect of any indemnification claims made in connection with such sale, any losses actually incurred by Wyndham Destinations or us in connection with the provision of post-closing credit support to the European vacation rental business to ensure that the European vacation rental business meets the requirements of certain service providers and regulatory authorities and any tax assets or liabilities related to such sale. The realization of any of these potential liabilities could have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nThe spin-off and related transactions may expose us to potential liabilities arising out of state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws and legal distribution requirements.\nAlthough we received a solvency opinion from an investment bank confirming that we and Wyndham Destinations were adequately capitalized immediately after the spin-off, the spin-off could be challenged under various state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws. An unpaid creditor could claim that Wyndham Destinations did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value in the spin-off, and that the spin-off left Wyndham Destinations insolvent or with unreasonably small capital or that Wyndham Destinations intended or believed it would incur debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature. If a court were to agree with such a plaintiff, then such court could void the spin-off as a fraudulent transfer and could impose a number of different remedies, including, returning our assets or your shares in our company to Wyndham Destinations or providing Wyndham Destinations with a claim for money damages against us in an amount equal to the\ndifference between the consideration received by Wyndham Destinations and the fair market value of our Company at the time of the spin-off.\nCertain of our Directors and executive officers may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their ownership of Wyndham Destinations equity or their current or former positions at Wyndham Destinations.\nTwo of our Directors also serve on the Wyndham Destinations board of directors. This could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest when our or Wyndham Destinations\u2019 management and directors face decisions that could have different implications for us and Wyndham Destinations, including the resolution of any dispute regarding the terms of the agreements governing the spin-off and the relationship between us and Wyndham Destinations, any commercial agreements entered into in the future between us and Wyndham Destinations and the allocation of such directors\u2019 time between us and Wyndham Destinations.\nBecause of their current or former positions with Wyndham Destinations, some of our executive officers and non-employee Directors own shares of Wyndham Destinations common stock. The continued ownership of Wyndham Destinations common stock by our Directors and executive officers creates or may create the appearance of conflicts of interest when these Directors and executive officers are faced with decisions that could have different implications for us and Wyndham Destinations.\nIf the spin-off, together with certain related transactions, were to fail to qualify as a reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Code, then our stockholders, we and Wyndham Destinations might be required to pay substantial U.S. federal income taxes including as a result of indemnification under the Tax Matters Agreement.\nThe spin-off was conditioned upon Wyndham Destinations\u2019 receipt of opinions of its spin-off tax advisors to the effect that, subject to the assumptions and limitations described in the opinions, the spin-off, together with certain related transactions, would qualify as a reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), in which no gain or loss would be recognized by Wyndham Destinations or its stockholders, except, in the case of Wyndham Destinations stockholders, for cash received in lieu of fractional shares, which opinions were delivered on the closing date of the spin-off. The opinions of its spin-off tax advisors were based on, among other things, certain assumptions as well as on the continuing accuracy of certain factual representations and statements that we and Wyndham Destinations made to the spin-off tax advisors. In rendering their opinion, the spin-off tax advisors also relied on certain covenants that we and Wyndham Destinations entered into, including the adherence by Wyndham Destinations and us to certain restrictions on our future actions contained in the Tax Matters Agreement. If any of the representations or statements that we or Wyndham Destinations made were or were to become inaccurate or incomplete, or if we or Wyndham Destinations breach any of our covenants, the spin-off and such related transactions might not qualify for such tax treatment. The opinions of the spin-off tax advisors are not binding on the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) or a court, and there can be no assurance that the IRS will not challenge the validity of the spin-off and such related transactions as a reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Code eligible for tax-free treatment, or that any such challenge ultimately will not prevail.\nIn addition, Wyndham Destinations received certain rulings from the IRS (the \u201cIRS Ruling\u201d) regarding certain U.S. federal income tax aspects of transactions related to the spin-off. Although the IRS Ruling generally is binding on the IRS, the continued validity of the IRS Ruling is based upon and subject to the continuing accuracy of factual statements and representations made to the IRS by Wyndham Destinations. The IRS Ruling is limited to specified aspects of the spin-off under Section 361 of the Code and does not represent a determination by the IRS that all of the requirements necessary to obtain tax-free treatment to holders of Wyndham Destinations common stock and to Wyndham Destinations were satisfied.\nWe are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would cause any such factual statements or representations in the opinions of Wyndham Destinations\u2019 spin-off tax advisers or the IRS Ruling to be incomplete or untrue or cause the facts on which the opinions or the IRS Ruling are based to be materially different from the facts at the time of the spin-off.\nIf the spin-off does not qualify as a tax-free transaction for any reason, including as a result of a breach of a representation or covenant, Wyndham Destinations would recognize a substantial gain attributable to our hotel business for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In such case, under U.S. Treasury regulations, each member of the Wyndham Destinations consolidated group at the time of the spin-off, including us and certain of our subsidiaries, would be jointly and severally liable for the entire resulting amount of any U.S. federal income tax liability. Additionally, if the distribution of our common stock does not qualify as tax-free under Section 355 of the Code, Wyndham Destinations stockholders will be treated as having received a taxable distribution equal to the value of our stock distributed, treated as a taxable dividend to the extent of\nWyndham Destinations\u2019 current and accumulated earnings and profits, and then would have a tax-free basis recovery up to the amount of their tax basis in their shares, and then would have taxable gain from the sale or exchange of the shares to the extent of any excess.\nOur ability to engage in acquisitions and other strategic transactions is subject to limitations because we have agreed to certain restrictions intended to support the tax-free nature of the distribution.\nThe U.S. federal income tax laws that apply to transactions like the spin-off generally create a presumption that the distribution would be taxable to Wyndham Destinations but not to Wyndham Destinations stockholders if we engage in, or enter into an agreement to engage in, a transaction that would result in a 50% or greater change by vote or by value in our stock ownership during the four-year period beginning two years before the distribution date, unless it is established that the transaction is not pursuant to a plan or series or transactions related to the distribution. U.S. Treasury regulations currently in effect generally provide that whether an acquisition transaction and a distribution are part of a plan is determined based on all of the facts and circumstances, including specific factors listed in the Treasury regulations. In addition, these Treasury regulations provide several \"safe harbors\" for acquisition transactions that are not considered to be part of a plan that includes a distribution.\nThere are other restrictions imposed on us under current U.S. federal income tax laws with which we will need to comply in order for the spin-off and certain related transactions to qualify as a transaction that is tax-free under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Code. For example, we are generally required to continue to own and manage our hotel business, and there are limitations on issuances, redemptions and sales of our stock for cash or other property following the distribution, except in connection with certain stock-for-stock acquisitions and other permitted transactions. If these restrictions are not followed, the spin-off could be taxable to Wyndham Destinations and Wyndham Destinations stockholders.\nWe have entered into a Tax Matters Agreement with Wyndham Destinations under which we have allocated, between Wyndham Destinations and ourselves, responsibility for U.S. federal, state and local and non-U.S. income and other taxes relating to taxable periods before and after the spin-off and provided for computing and apportioning tax liabilities and tax benefits between the parties. In the Tax Matters Agreement, we have agreed that, among other things, we may not take, or fail to take, any action following the spin-off if such action, or failure to act: would be inconsistent with or prohibit the spin-off and certain restructuring transactions related to the spin-off and certain related transactions from qualifying as a tax-free reorganization under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 and related provisions of the Code to Wyndham Destinations and Wyndham Destinations stockholders except with respect to the receipt of cash in lieu of fractional shares of our stock; or would be inconsistent with, or cause to be untrue, any representation, statement, information or covenant made in connection with the IRS Ruling, the tax opinions provided by Wyndham Destinations\u2019 spin-off tax advisors or the Tax Matters Agreement relating to the qualification of the spin-off and certain related transactions as a tax-free transaction under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 and related provisions of the Code.\nIn addition, we have agreed that we may not, among other things, during the two-year period following the spin-off, except under certain specified circumstances, issue, sell or redeem our stock or other securities or those of certain of our subsidiaries; liquidate, merge or consolidate with another person; sell or dispose of assets outside the ordinary course of business or materially change the manner of operating our business; or enter into any agreement, understanding or arrangement, or engage in any substantial negotiations with respect to any transaction or series of transactions which would cause us to undergo a specified percentage or greater change in our stock ownership by value or voting power. These restrictions could limit our strategic and operational flexibility, including our ability to finance our operations by issuing equity securities, make acquisitions using equity securities, repurchase our equity securities, or raise money by selling assets or enter into business combination transactions. We have also agreed to indemnify Wyndham Destinations for certain tax liabilities resulting from any such transactions. Further, our stockholders may consider these covenants and indemnity obligations unfavorable as they might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nThe trading market price of shares of our common stock may fluctuate widely.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate widely, depending upon many factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nsuccess or failure of our business strategies;\n\u2022\nfailure to achieve our growth and performance objectives;\n\u2022\nour quarterly or annual earnings, or those of other companies in our industry;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain financing as needed;\n\u2022\na shift in our investor base;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws and regulations affecting our business;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions or dispositions;\n\u2022\nnegative views about our stock or our business expressed by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates;\n\u2022\nthe operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies;\n\u2022\noverall market fluctuations;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results due to the seasonality of our business and other factors related to our business; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions.\nThese factors may result in short-term or long-term negative pressure on the value of our common stock. Stock markets in general have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nYour percentage ownership in Wyndham Hotels may be diluted in the future.\nYour percentage ownership in Wyndham Hotels may be diluted in the future because of equity awards that we have and expect will be issued to our Directors and employees and any potential future issuances of stock by us to raise capital or in connection with an acquisition.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated by-laws and Delaware law may prevent or delay an acquisition of Wyndham Hotels, which could decrease the trading price of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated by-laws and Delaware corporate law contain provisions that are intended to deter or delay coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids. For example, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and/or amended and restated by-laws will require advance notice for stockholder proposals, place limitations on convening stockholder meetings, authorize our Board to issue one or more series of preferred stock and provide for the classification of our Board of Directors until the third annual meeting of stockholders following the spin-off.\nDelaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15% or more of our outstanding common stock. We believe these provisions protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our Board of Directors and by providing our Board of Directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal. These provisions are not intended to make us immune from takeovers. However, these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our Board of Directors determines is not in the best interests of our company and our stockholders.\nOur amended and restated by-laws designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our Directors or employees.\nOur amended and restated by-laws provide that, subject to limited exceptions, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for derivative actions; claims related to a breach of a fiduciary duty, corporate law, our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws; or under the internal affairs doctrine. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our Directors or employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our Directors and employees.\nWe may not pay dividends on our common stock, and the terms our indebtedness could limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock.\nAny decision to declare and pay dividends will be made at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, cash requirements, financial condition, contractual restrictions under our indebtedness and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. There can be no assurance that a payment of a dividend will occur in the future.", "PERMNO": 17794, "SIC": 7011, "TIC": "WH"}
