{"cik": "1326380", "company": "GameStop Corp.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-28", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nAn investment in our company involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks below, together with the other information contained in this report, before you make an investment decision with respect to our company. The risks described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks not presently known to us, or that we consider immaterial, may also impair our business operations. Any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition, and could cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock and the value of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nIf economic conditions do not improve, demand for the products we sell may decline.\nSales of our products involve discretionary spending by consumers. Consumers are typically more likely to make discretionary purchases, including purchasing video game products, when there are favorable economic conditions. In recent years, poor worldwide economic conditions have led consumers to delay or reduce discretionary spending, including purchases of the products we sell. If conditions do not continue to improve, or deteriorate, these delays or reductions may continue, which could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe video game industry is cyclical and affected by the introduction of next-generation consoles, which could negatively impact the demand for existing products or our pre-owned business.\nThe video game industry has been cyclical in nature in response to the introduction and maturation of new technology. Following the introduction of new video game platforms, sales of these platforms and related software and accessories generally increase due to initial demand, while sales of older platforms and related products generally decrease as customers migrate toward the new platforms. A new console cycle began when Nintendo launched the Wii U in November 2012 and Sony and Microsoft\neach launched their next generation of consoles, the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, respectively, in November 2013. If the new video game platforms do not continue to be successful, our sales of video game products could decline. The introduction of these next-generation consoles could negatively impact the demand for existing products or our pre-owned business, which could have a negative impact on our sales and earnings.\nThe introduction of another new generation of consoles could negatively impact the demand for existing products or our pre-owned business.\nThe introduction of another new generation of consoles, the features of such consoles or changes to the existing generations of consoles, including any future restrictions or conditions that may adversely affect our pre-owned business or the ability to play prior generation video games on such consoles, and the impact on demand for existing products could have a negative impact on our sales and earnings.\nWe depend upon the timely delivery of new and innovative products from our vendors.\nWe depend on major hardware manufacturers, primarily Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo, to deliver new and existing video game platforms and new innovations on a timely basis and in anticipated quantities. In addition, we depend on software publishers to introduce new and updated software titles. We have experienced sales declines in the past due to a reduction in the number of new software titles available for sale. Any material delay in the introduction or delivery, or limited allocations, of hardware platforms or software titles could result in reduced sales.\nIf we fail to keep pace with changing industry technology and consumer preferences, we will be at a competitive disadvantage.\nThe interactive entertainment industry is characterized by swiftly changing technology, evolving industry standards, frequent new and enhanced product introductions, rapidly changing consumer preferences and product obsolescence. Video games are now played on a wide variety of mediums, including mobile phones, tablets, social networking websites and other devices. In order to continue to compete effectively in the video game industry, we need to respond quickly to technological changes and to understand their impact on our customers\u2019 preferences. It may take significant time and resources to respond to these technological changes. If we fail to keep pace with these changes, our business may suffer.\nTechnological advances in the delivery and types of video games and PC entertainment software, as well as changes in consumer behavior related to these new technologies, could lower our sales.\nWhile it is currently possible to download video game content to the current generation video game systems, downloading is somewhat constrained by bandwidth capacity and video game file sizes. However, broadband speeds are increasing and downloading technology is becoming more prevalent and continues to evolve rapidly. The current consoles from Sony and Microsoft have facilitated download technology. If these consoles and other advances in technology continue to expand our customers\u2019 ability to access and download the current format of video games and incremental content for their games through these and other sources, our customers may no longer choose to purchase video games in our stores or reduce their purchases in favor of other forms of game delivery. As a result, our sales and earnings could decline.\nWe may not compete effectively as browser, mobile and social gaming becomes more popular.\nGaming continues to evolve rapidly. The popularity of browser, mobile and social gaming has increased greatly and this popularity is expected to continue to grow. Browser, mobile and social gaming is accessed through hardware other than the consoles and traditional hand-held video game devices we currently sell. If we are unable to respond to this growth in popularity of browser, mobile and social games and transition our business to take advantage of these new forms of gaming, our financial position and results of operations could suffer. We have been and are currently pursuing various strategies to integrate these new forms of gaming into our business model, but we can provide no assurances that these strategies will be successful or profitable.\nOur ability to obtain favorable terms from our suppliers may impact our financial results.\nOur financial results depend significantly upon the business terms we can obtain from our suppliers, including competitive prices, unsold product return policies, advertising and market development allowances, freight charges and payment terms. We purchase substantially all of our products directly from manufacturers, software publishers and, in some cases, distributors. Our largest vendors worldwide are Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo and Electronic Arts, which accounted for 27%, 19%, 11% and 10%, respectively, of our new product purchases in fiscal 2015. If our suppliers do not provide us with favorable business terms, we may not be able to offer products to our customers at competitive prices.\nIf our vendors fail to provide marketing and merchandising support at historical levels, our sales and earnings could be negatively impacted.\nThe manufacturers of video game hardware and software have typically provided retailers with significant marketing and merchandising support for their products. Additionally, AT&T and Apple provide our Technology Brands stores with similar support. As part of this support, we receive cooperative advertising and market development payments from these vendors. These cooperative advertising and market development payments enable us to actively promote and merchandise the products we sell and drive sales at our stores and on our websites. We cannot assure you that vendors will continue to provide this support at historical levels. If they fail to do so, our sales and earnings could be negatively impacted.\nThe continued growth of our Technology Brands segment is dependent in large part on our relationship with AT&T and any material adverse change to this relationship would affect our results.\nWe continue to grow our Technology Brands segment as a way to diversify our business in order to continue to drive growth and to help mitigate the financial impact from the cyclical nature of the video game console business. Gross margins in our Technology Brands segment are higher than in our Video Game Brands segment and as a result, a growing portion of our profits is due to the growth of our Technology Brands segment. Our Technology Brands segment is primarily conducted through Spring Mobile, an authorized AT&T reseller currently operating 890 AT&T branded stores selling post-paid wireless services and products, and 70 Cricket branded stores selling pre-paid wireless services and products. Therefore, we depend in large part on our relationship with AT&T for the continued growth of our Technology Brands segment. In particular, we depend on AT&T for constant innovation and the timely delivery of products and services to our stores. Any material adverse change in our relationship with AT&T, including termination of the relationship (which is permissible upon a short notice period), the lack of innovation or failure to timely supply products or competitive service plans, or changes in the manner in which AT&T compensates its resellers, could materially affect the continued growth of our Technology Brands segment and our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur growing relationship with AT&T could have an adverse impact on our business, including as a result of restrictions on our ability to offer products and services in the United States that compete with AT&T in wireless and wireline communications and a variety of technology businesses.\nWe are a significant reseller of AT&T products and services through our Technology Brands segment. We also sell certain AT&T products and services through our Video Game Brands stores. Our agreements with AT&T and its affiliates impose significant restrictions on our ability to offer products and services in the United States that compete with AT&T in wireless and wireline communications and a variety of technology businesses, including several that are adjacent to markets in which we participate or are considering entering, which could materially adversely impact this component of our business.\nWe have made and may make investments and acquisitions which could negatively impact our business if we fail to successfully complete and integrate them, or if they fail to perform in accordance with our expectations.\nTo enhance our efforts to grow and compete, we have made and continue to make investments and acquisitions. These activities include investments in and acquisitions of digital, browser, social and mobile gaming and technology-based companies as the delivery methods for video games continue to evolve, and investments in new retail categories like wireless and consumer electronics. Our plans to pursue future transactions are subject to our ability to identify potential candidates and negotiate favorable terms for these transactions. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that future investments or acquisitions will be completed. In addition, to facilitate future transactions, we may take actions that could dilute the equity interests of our stockholders, increase our debt or cause us to assume contingent liabilities, all of which may have a detrimental effect on the price of our common stock. Also, companies that we have acquired, and that we may acquire in the future, could have products that are in development, and there is no assurance that these products will be successfully developed. Finally, if any acquisitions are not successfully integrated with our business, or fail to perform in accordance with our expectations, our ongoing operations could be adversely affected. Integration of digital, browser, social and mobile gaming and mobile phone and technology-based companies or other retailers may be particularly challenging to us as these companies are outside of our historical operating expertise.\nPressure from our competitors may force us to reduce our prices or increase spending, which could decrease our profitability.\nThe retail environment is intensely competitive and subject to rapid changes in consumer preferences and frequent new product introductions. We compete with mass merchants and regional chains, including Wal-Mart and Target; computer product and consumer electronics stores, including Best Buy; internet-based retailers such as Amazon.com; other U.S. and international video game and PC software specialty stores located in malls and other locations, such as Carrefour and Media Markt; toy retail chains; direct sales by software publishers; and online retailers and game rental companies. Some of our competitors have longer operating histories and may have greater financial resources than we do or other advantages, including non-taxability of sold merchandise. In addition, video game products and content are increasingly being digitally distributed and new competitors built to take advantage\nof these new capabilities are entering the marketplace, and other methods may emerge in the future. We also compete with other sellers of pre-owned video game products and other PC software distribution companies, including Steam. Certain of our mass-merchant competitors are expanding in the market for pre-owned video games through aggressive pricing which may negatively affect our margins, sales and earnings for these products. Additionally, we compete with other forms of entertainment activities, including browser, social and mobile games, movies, television, theater, sporting events and family entertainment centers. Our Technology Brands stores compete with a wide variety of other wireless carriers and retailers and consumer electronics retailers, including AT&T, which competes with our Spring Mobile managed AT&T and Cricket branded stores. If we lose customers to our competitors, or if we reduce our prices or increase our spending to maintain our customers, we may be less profitable.\nWe depend upon our key personnel and they would be difficult to replace.\nOur success depends upon our ability to attract, motivate and retain a highly trained and engaged workforce, including key management for our stores and skilled merchandising, marketing, financial and administrative personnel. The turnover rate in the retail industry is relatively high, and there is an ongoing need to recruit and train new store employees. Factors that affect our ability to maintain sufficient numbers of qualified employees include employee morale, our reputation, unemployment rates, competition from other employers and our ability to offer appropriate compensation packages. Additionally, we depend upon the continued services of our key executive officers, including our Executive Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer and Executive Vice Presidents. Our inability to recruit a sufficient number of qualified individuals or our failure to retain key employees in the future may have a negative impact on our business.\nInternational events could delay or prevent the delivery of products to our suppliers.\nOur suppliers rely on foreign sources, primarily in Asia, to manufacture a portion of the products we purchase from them. As a result, any event causing a disruption of imports, including natural disasters or the imposition of import restrictions or trade restrictions in the form of tariffs or quotas, could increase the cost and reduce the supply of products available to us, which could lower our sales and profitability.\nOur international operations expose us to numerous risks.\nWe have international retail operations in Australia, Canada and Europe. Because release schedules for hardware and software introduction in these markets can sometimes differ from release schedules in the United States, the timing of increases and decreases in foreign sales may differ from the timing of increases and decreases in domestic sales. We are also subject to a number of other factors that may affect our current or future international operations. These include:\n\u2022\neconomic downturns, specifically in the regions in which we operate;\n\u2022\ncurrency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u2022\ninternational incidents;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters;\n\u2022\ngovernment instability; and\n\u2022\ncompetitors entering our current and potential markets.\nOur operations in Europe are also subject to risks associated with the current economic conditions and uncertainties in the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d). European and global economic conditions have already been negatively impacted by the ability of certain EU member states to service their sovereign debt obligations. Additionally, there continues to be uncertainty over the possibility that other EU member states may experience similar financial troubles, the ultimate outcome of the EU governments\u2019 financial support programs, the possible breakup or restructuring of the EU and the possible elimination or restructuring of the EU monetary system. These continued uncertainties could further disrupt European and global economic conditions. Unfavorable economic conditions could negatively impact consumer demand for our products. These factors could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are also subject to risks that our operations outside the United States could be conducted by our employees, contractors, representatives or agents in ways that violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or other similar anti-bribery laws. While we have policies and procedures intended to ensure compliance with these laws, our employees, contractors, representatives and agents may take actions that violate our policies. Moreover, it may be more difficult to oversee the conduct of any such persons who are not our employees, potentially exposing us to greater risk from their actions. Any violations of those laws by any of those persons could have a negative impact on our business.\nUnfavorable changes in our global tax rate could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nAs a result of our operations in many foreign countries, our global tax rate is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Depending upon the sources of our income, any agreements we may have with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and the tax filing positions we take in various jurisdictions, our overall tax rate may be higher than other companies or higher than our tax rates have been in the past. We base our estimate of an annual effective tax rate at any given point in time on a calculated mix of the tax rates applicable to our business and to estimates of the amount of income to be derived in any given jurisdiction. A change in the mix of our business from year to year and from country to country, changes in rules related to accounting for income taxes, changes in tax laws in any of the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate or adverse outcomes from the tax audits that regularly are in process in any jurisdiction in which we operate could result in an unfavorable change in our overall tax rate, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of our operations.\nIf we are unable to renew or enter into new leases on favorable terms, our revenue growth may decline.\nAll of our retail stores are located in leased premises. If the cost of leasing existing stores increases, we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our existing store locations as leases expire. In addition, we may not be able to enter into new leases on favorable terms or at all, or we may not be able to locate suitable alternative sites or additional sites for new store expansion in a timely manner. Our revenues and earnings may decline if we fail to maintain existing store locations, enter into new leases, locate alternative sites or find additional sites for new store expansion.\nRestrictions on our ability to take trade-ins of and sell pre-owned video game products or pre-owned mobile devices could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur financial results depend on our ability to take trade-ins of, and sell, pre-owned video game products and pre-owned mobile devices within our stores. Actions by manufacturers or publishers of video game products or mobile devices, wireless carriers or governmental authorities to prohibit or limit our ability to take trade-ins or sell pre-owned video game products or mobile devices, or to limit the ability of consumers to play pre-owned video games or use pre-owned mobile devices, could have a negative impact on our sales and earnings.\nSales of video games containing graphic violence may decrease as a result of actual violent events or other reasons, and our financial results may be adversely affected as a result.\nMany popular video games contain material with graphic violence. These games receive an \u201cM\u201d or \u201cT\u201d rating from the Entertainment Software Ratings Board. As actual violent events occur and are publicized, or for other reasons, public acceptance of graphic violence in video games may decline. Consumer advocacy groups may increase their efforts to oppose sales of graphically-violent video games and may seek legislation prohibiting their sales. As a result, our sales of those games may decrease, which could adversely affect our financial results.\nAn adverse trend in sales during the holiday selling season could impact our financial results.\nOur business, like that of many retailers, is seasonal, with the major portion of our sales and operating profit realized during the fourth fiscal quarter, which includes the holiday selling season. During fiscal 2015, we generated approximately 38% of our sales during the fourth quarter. Any adverse trend in sales during the holiday selling season could lower our results of operations for the fourth quarter and the entire fiscal year.\nOur results of operations may fluctuate from quarter to quarter.\nOur results of operations may fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending upon several factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe timing and allocations of new product releases including new console launches;\n\u2022\nthe timing of new store openings or closings;\n\u2022\nshifts in the timing or content of certain promotions or service offerings;\n\u2022\nthe effect of changes in tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate;\n\u2022\nacquisition costs and the integration of companies we acquire or invest in;\n\u2022\nthe mix of earnings in the countries in which we operate;\n\u2022\nthe costs associated with the exit of unprofitable markets or stores; and\n\u2022\nchanges in foreign currency exchange rates.\nThese and other factors could affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, and this makes the prediction of our financial results on a quarterly basis difficult. Also, it is possible that our quarterly financial results may be below the expectations of public market analysts.\nFailure to effectively manage our new store openings could lower our sales and profitability.\nOur growth strategy depends in part upon opening new stores and operating them profitably. We opened 85 Video Game Brands stores (including 31 collectibles stores) and opened or acquired 568 Technology Brands stores in fiscal 2015. We expect to open approximately 140 new stores in fiscal 2016, including 90 Video Game Brands stores (including 84 collectibles stores) and 50 Technology Brands stores. Our ability to open new stores and operate them profitably depends upon a number of factors, some of which may be beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u2022\nthe ability to identify new store locations, negotiate suitable leases and build out the stores in a timely and cost efficient manner;\n\u2022\nthe ability to hire and train skilled associates;\n\u2022\nthe ability to integrate new stores into our existing operations; and\n\u2022\nthe ability to increase sales at new store locations.\nIf we fail to manage new store openings in a timely and cost efficient manner, our growth or profits may decrease.\nFailure to successfully execute our strategy to close stores and transfer customers and sales to nearby stores could adversely impact our financial results.\nOur strategy includes closing stores which are not meeting our performance standards or stores at the end of their lease terms and transferring sales to other nearby GameStop locations. We closed approximately 210 Video Game Brands stores worldwide in fiscal 2015 and plan to close approximately 200 Video Game Brands stores worldwide in fiscal 2016. We believe that we can ultimately increase profitability by successfully transferring customers and sales to other stores by marketing directly to the PowerUp Rewards members who have shopped in the stores that we plan to close. If we are unsuccessful in marketing to customers of the stores that we plan to close or in transferring sales to nearby stores, our sales and profitability could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on centralized facilities for refurbishment of our pre-owned products. Any disruption to these facilities could adversely affect our profitability.\nWe rely on centralized facilities for the refurbishment of all pre-owned products that we sell. If any disruption occurred at these facilities, whether due to natural disaster or severe weather, or events such as fire, accidents, power outages, systems failures, or other unforeseen causes, sales of our pre-owned products could decrease. Since we generally obtain higher margins on our pre-owned products, any adverse effect on their sales could adversely affect our profitability.\nIf our management information systems fail to perform or are inadequate, our ability to manage our business could be disrupted.\nWe rely on computerized inventory and management systems to coordinate and manage the activities in our distribution centers, as well as to communicate distribution information to the off-site, third-party operated distribution centers with which we work. The third-party distribution centers pick up products from our suppliers, repackage the products for each of our stores and ship those products to our stores by package carriers. We use inventory replenishment systems to track sales and inventory. Our ability to rapidly process incoming shipments of new release titles and deliver them to all of our stores, either that day or by the next morning, enables us to meet peak demand and replenish stores at least twice a week, to keep our stores in stock at optimum levels and to move inventory efficiently. If our inventory or management information systems fail to adequately perform these functions, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, if operations in any of our distribution centers were to shut down or be disrupted for a prolonged period of time or if these centers were unable to accommodate the continued store growth in a particular region, our business could suffer.\nData breaches involving customer or employee data stored by us could adversely affect our reputation and revenues.\nWe store confidential information with respect to our customers and employees. A compromise of our data security systems or those of businesses with which we interact could result in information related to our customers or employees being obtained by unauthorized persons. Any such breach of our systems could lead to fraudulent activity resulting in claims and lawsuits against us or other operational problems or interruptions in connection with such breaches. Consequently, despite our efforts, our security\nmeasures have been breached in the past and may be breached in the future due to cyber attack, team member error, malfeasance, fraudulent inducement or other acts; and unauthorized parties have in the past obtained, and may in the future obtain, access to our data or our customers\u2019 data. While costs associated with past security breaches have not been significant, any breach or unauthorized access in the future could result in significant legal and financial exposure and damage to our reputation that could potentially have an adverse effect on our business. While we also seek to obtain assurances that others with whom we interact will protect confidential information, there is a risk the confidentiality of data held or accessed by others may be compromised. If a compromise of our data security or function of our computer systems or website were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition and, possibly, subject us to additional legal, regulatory and operating costs and damage our reputation in the marketplace.\nAlso, the interpretation and enforcement of data protection laws in the United States, Europe and elsewhere are uncertain and, in certain circumstances, contradictory. These laws may be interpreted and enforced in a manner that is inconsistent with our policies and practices. If we are subject to data security breaches or government-imposed fines, we may have a loss in sales or be forced to pay damages or other amounts, which could adversely affect profitability, or be subject to substantial costs related to compliance.\nLitigation and the outcomes of such litigation could negatively impact our future financial condition and results of operations.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we are, from time to time, subject to various litigation and legal proceedings. In the future, the costs or results of such legal proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, could have a negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nLegislative actions and changes in accounting rules may cause our general and administrative and compliance costs to increase and impact our future financial condition and results of operations.\nIn order to comply with laws adopted by the U.S. government or other U.S. or foreign regulatory bodies, we may be required to increase our expenditures and hire additional personnel and additional outside legal, accounting and advisory services, all of which may cause our general and administrative and compliance costs to increase. Significant workforce-related legislative changes could increase our expenses and adversely affect our operations. Examples of possible workforce-related legislative changes include changes to an employer's obligation to recognize collective bargaining units, the process by which collective bargaining agreements are negotiated or imposed, minimum wage requirements, and health care mandates. In addition, changes in the regulatory environment affecting Medicare reimbursements, product safety, supply chain transparency, and increased compliance costs related to enforcement of federal and state wage and hour statutes and common law related to overtime, among others, could cause our expenses to increase without an ability to pass through any increased expenses through higher prices. Environmental legislation or other regulatory changes could impose unexpected costs or impact us more directly than other companies due to our operations as a global retailer. Specifically, environmental legislation or international agreements affecting energy, carbon emissions, and water or product materials are continually being explored by governing bodies. Increasing energy and fuel costs, supply chain disruptions and other potential risks to our business, as well as any significant rule making or passage of any such legislation, could materially increase the cost to transport our goods and materially adversely affect our results of operations. Additionally, regulatory and enforcement activity focused on the retail industry has increased in recent years, increasing the risk of fines and additional operational costs associated with compliance.\nAs a seller of certain consumer products, we are subject to various federal, state, local and international laws, regulations, and statutes relating to product safety and consumer protection.\nWhile we take steps to comply with these laws, there can be no assurance that we will be in compliance, and failure to comply with these laws could result in penalties which could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may also be subject to involuntary or voluntary product recalls or product liability lawsuits. Direct costs or reputational damage associated with product recalls or product liability lawsuits, individually or in the aggregate, could have a negative impact on future revenues and results of operations.\nOur Board of Directors could change our dividend policy at any time.\nWe initiated our first cash dividend on our common stock during fiscal 2012. Notwithstanding the foregoing, there is no assurance that we will continue to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the future. Certain provisions in our credit facility and covenants under the indentures for our 5.50% Senior Notes due October 1, 2019 (the \u201c2019 Senior Notes\u201d) and our 6.75% Senior Notes due March 15, 2021 (the \"2021 Senior Notes\" and, together, the \u201cSenior Notes\u201d), restrict our ability to pay dividends in certain circumstances. In addition, subject to any financial covenants in current or future financing agreements that directly or indirectly restrict our ability to pay dividends, the payment of dividends is within the discretion of our Board of Directors and will\ndepend upon our future earnings and cash flow from operations, our capital requirements, our financial condition and any other factors that the Board of Directors may consider. Unless we continue to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the future, the success of an investment in our common stock will depend entirely upon its future appreciation. Our common stock may not appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which it was purchased.\nWe may record future goodwill impairment charges or other asset impairment charges which could negatively impact our future results of operations and financial condition.\nIn recent periods we have recorded significant non-cash charges relating to the impairment of goodwill and other tangible and intangible assets that had a material adverse effect on our consolidated statements of operations and consolidated balance sheets. Because we have grown in part through acquisitions, goodwill and other acquired intangible assets represent a substantial portion of our assets. We also have long-lived assets consisting of property and equipment and other identifiable intangible assets which we review both on an annual basis as well as when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If a determination is made that a significant impairment in value of goodwill, other intangible assets or long-lived assets has occurred, such determination could require us to impair a substantial portion of our assets. Asset impairments could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Indebtedness\nBecause of our floating rate credit facility, we may be adversely affected by interest rate changes.\nOur financial position may be affected by fluctuations in interest rates, as our senior credit facility is subject to floating interest rates.\nInterest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control. If we were to borrow against our senior credit facility, a significant increase in interest rates could have an adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nThe terms of our Senior Notes and senior credit facility may impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us.\nThe terms of our Senior Notes and our senior credit facility may impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us in certain circumstances. These restrictions, among other things, limit our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur, assume or permit to exist additional indebtedness or guaranty obligations;\n\u2022\nincur liens or agree to negative pledges in other agreements;\n\u2022\nengage in sale and leaseback transactions;\n\u2022\nmake loans and investments;\n\u2022\ndeclare dividends, make payments or redeem or repurchase capital stock;\n\u2022\nengage in mergers, acquisitions and other business combinations;\n\u2022\nprepay, redeem or purchase certain indebtedness;\n\u2022\namend or otherwise alter the terms of our organizational documents and indebtedness;\n\u2022\nsell assets; and\n\u2022\nengage in transactions with affiliates.\nWe cannot assure that these covenants will not adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or to pursue available business opportunities and may affect our ability to grow in accordance with our strategy. A breach of the covenants or restrictions under the indentures for the Senior Notes, or under our senior credit facility, could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness. Such a default may allow the creditors to accelerate the repayment of the related debt and may result in the acceleration of the repayment of any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applied. In addition, an event of default under our senior credit facility would permit the lenders to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under that facility. Furthermore, if we were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under our senior credit facility, those lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. In the event that our lenders or noteholders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness. See Note 10, \"Debt,\" to our consolidated financial statements for a description of our Senior Notes and senior credit facility.\nTo service our indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service obligations.\nOur ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled payments on our indebtedness, including without limitation any payments required to be made under our senior credit facility or to holders of our Senior Notes, and to fund our operations, will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. If we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to satisfy our debt obligations, including interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as refinancing or restructuring our debt, including the Senior Notes, selling assets, reducing or delaying capital investments or seeking to raise additional capital. We cannot provide assurance that any refinancing would be possible, that any assets could be sold, or, if sold, of the timing of the sales and the amount of proceeds realized from those sales, that additional financing could be obtained on acceptable terms, if at all, or if that additional financing would be permitted under the terms of our various debt instruments, then in effect. Our senior credit facility and the indentures governing the Senior Notes restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from those sales and raise debt or equity to meet any debt service obligations then due. Our ability to refinance would also depend upon the condition of the finance and credit markets. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations, including the Senior Notes, or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms or on a timely basis, would have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nDespite current indebtedness levels, we and our subsidiaries may still be able to incur additional debt. This could further increase the risks associated with our leverage.\nWe are able to incur additional indebtedness. Although our senior credit facility and the indentures for our Senior Notes contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and the additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. These restrictions also will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness. Such future indebtedness or obligations may have restrictions similar to, or more restrictive than, those included in the indentures for our Senior Notes or our senior credit facility. The incurrence of additional indebtedness could impact our financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 90379, "SIC": 5734, "TIC": "GME"}
