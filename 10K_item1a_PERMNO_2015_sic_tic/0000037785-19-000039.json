{"cik": "37785", "company": "FMC CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-02-28", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nBelow lists our risk factors updated for these events.\nAmong the factors that could have an impact on our ability to achieve operating results and meet our other goals are:\nIndustry Risks:\nPricing and volumes in our markets are sensitive to a number of industry specific and global issues and events including:\n\u2022\nCapacity utilization - Our FMC Lithium segment is sensitive to industry capacity utilization. As a result, pricing tends to fluctuate when capacity utilization changes occur within the industry.\n\u2022\nCompetition - All of our segments face competition, which could affect our ability to maintain or raise prices, successfully enter certain markets or retain our market position. Competition for our FMC Agricultural Solutions segment includes not only generic suppliers of the same pesticidal active ingredients but also alternative proprietary pesticide chemistries and crop protection technologies that are bred into or applied onto seeds. Increased generic presence in agricultural chemical markets has been driven by the number of significant product patents and product data protections that have expired in the last decade, and this trend is expected to continue. Also, there are changing competitive dynamics in the agrochemical industry as some of our competitors have consolidated, resulting in them having greater scale and diversity. These competitive differences may not be overcome and may erode our business.\n\u2022\nChanges in our customer base - Our customer base has the potential to change, especially when long-term supply contracts are renegotiated. Our FMC Lithium segment is most sensitive to this risk.\n\u2022\nClimatic conditions - Our FMC Agricultural Solutions markets are affected by climatic conditions, which could adversely impact crop pricing and pest infestations. For example, drought may reduce the need for fungicides, which could result in fewer sales and greater unsold inventories in the market, whereas excessive rain could lead to increased plant disease or weed growth requiring growers to purchase and use more pesticides. Adverse weather conditions can impact our ability to extract lithium efficiently from our lithium reserves in Argentina. Natural disasters can impact production at our facilities in various parts of the world. The nature of these events makes them difficult to predict.\n\u2022\nChanging regulatory environment - Changes in the regulatory environment, particularly in the United States, Brazil, China, Argentina and the European Union, could adversely impact our ability to continue producing and/or selling certain products in our domestic and foreign markets or could increase the cost of doing so. Our FMC Agricultural Solutions segment is most sensitive to this general regulatory risk given the need to obtain and maintain pesticide registrations in every country in which we sell our products. Many countries require re-registration of pesticides to meet new and more challenging requirements; while we defend our products vigorously, these re-registration processes may result in significant additional data costs, reduced number of permitted product uses, or potential product cancellation. Compliance with changing laws and regulations may involve significant costs or capital expenditures or require changes in business practice that could result in reduced profitability. In the European Union, the regulatory risk specifically includes the chemicals regulation known as REACH (Registration, Evaluation, and Authorization of Chemicals), which affects each of our business segments to varying degrees. The fundamental principle behind the REACH regulation is that manufacturers must verify through a special registration system that their chemicals can be marketed safely.\n\u2022\nGeographic presence outside of United States - With the acquisition of the DuPont Crop Protection Business, FMC Agricultural Solutions has a strong presence in Latin America, Europe and Asia, as well as in the United States. Growth of our geographic footprint particularly in Europe and key Asian countries such as India means that developments outside the United States will generally have a more significant effect on our operations than in the past. Our operations outside the United States are subject to special risks and restrictions, including: fluctuations in currency values; exchange control\nregulations; changes in local political or economic conditions; governmental pricing directives; import and trade restrictions; import or export licensing requirements and trade policy; restrictions on the ability to repatriate funds; and other potentially detrimental domestic and foreign governmental practices or policies affecting U.S. companies doing business abroad.\n\u2022\nPharmaceutical regulation - Our FMC Lithium facility in Bessemer City, North Carolina, and some of our manufacturing processes at that facility, as well as some of our customers, are subject to regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) or similar foreign agencies. Regulatory requirements of the FDA and USDA are complex, and any failure to comply with them including as a result of contamination due to acts of sabotage could subject us and/or our customers to fines, injunctions, civil penalties, lawsuits, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial of government approvals, withdrawal of marketing approvals and criminal prosecution. Any of these actions could adversely impact our net sales, undermine goodwill established with our customers, damage commercial prospects for our products and materially adversely affect our results of operations.\n\u2022\nClimate change regulation - Changes in the regulation of greenhouse gases, depending on their nature and scope, could subject our manufacturing operations to significant additional costs or limits on operations.\n\u2022\nFluctuations in commodity prices - Our operating results could be significantly affected by the cost of commodities. We may not be able to raise prices or improve productivity sufficiently to offset future increases in chemical raw material commodity pricing. Accordingly, increases in such commodity prices may negatively affect our financial results. We use hedging strategies to address material commodity price risks, where hedge strategies are available on reasonable terms. However, we are unable to avoid the risk of medium- and long-term increases. Additionally, fluctuations in harvested crop commodity prices could negatively impact our customers' ability to sell their products at previously forecasted prices resulting in reduced customer liquidity. Inadequate customer liquidity could affect our customers\u2019 abilities to pay for our products and, therefore, affect existing and future sales or our ability to collect on customer receivables.\n\u2022\nSupply arrangements - Certain raw materials are critical to our production processes and our purchasing strategy and supply chain design are complex. While we have made supply arrangements to meet planned operating requirements, an inability to obtain the critical raw materials or operate under contract manufacturing arrangements would adversely impact our ability to produce certain products and could lead to operational disruption and increase uncertainties around business performance. We increasingly source critical intermediates and finished products from a number of suppliers, largely outside of the U.S. and principally in China. An inability to obtain these products or execute under contract sourcing arrangements would adversely impact our ability to sell products.\n\u2022\nEconomic and political change - Our business has been and could continue to be adversely affected by economic and political changes in the markets where we compete including: inflation rates, recessions, trade restrictions, tariff increases or potential new tariffs, foreign ownership restrictions and economic embargoes imposed by the United States or any of the foreign countries in which we do business; changes in laws, taxation, and regulations and the interpretation and application of these laws, taxes, and regulations; restrictions imposed by the United States government or foreign governments through exchange controls or taxation policy; nationalization or expropriation of property, undeveloped property rights, and legal systems or political instability; other governmental actions; and other external factors over which we have no control. Economic and political conditions within the United States and foreign jurisdictions or strained relations between countries can cause fluctuations in demand, price volatility, supply disruptions, or loss of property. In Argentina, continued inflation and foreign exchange controls could adversely affect our business. Realignment of change in regional economic arrangements could have an operational impact on our businesses. In China, unpredictable enforcement of environmental regulations could result in unanticipated shutdowns in broad geographic areas, impacting our contract manufacturers and raw material suppliers.\nOperational Risks:\n\u2022\nMarket access risk - Our results may be affected by changes in distribution channels, which could impact our ability to access the market.\n\u2022\nBusiness disruptions - We produce product through a combination of owned facilities and contract manufacturers. As a result of the DuPont Crop Protection Acquisition we now own and operate large-scale manufacturing facilities in the United States (Mobile), Puerto Rico (Manati) and China (Pudong and Jinshan) in addition to our legacy active ingredient plants in Denmark (Ronland) and India (Panoli). This presents us with additional operating risks as our operating results will be dependent in part on the continued operation of the acquired production facilities. Interruptions at these facilities may materially reduce the productivity of a particular manufacturing facility, or the profitability of our business as a whole. Although we take precautions to enhance the safety of our operations and minimize the risk of disruptions, our operations and those of our contract manufacturers are subject to hazards inherent in chemical manufacturing and the related storage and transportation of raw materials, products and wastes. These potential hazards include explosions, fires, severe weather and natural disasters, mechanical failure, unscheduled downtimes, supplier disruptions, labor shortages or other labor difficulties, information technology systems outages, disruption in our supply chain or manufacturing and distribution operations, transportation interruptions, chemical spills, discharges or releases of toxic\nor hazardous substances or gases, shipment of contaminated or off-specification product to customers, storage tank leaks, other environmental risks, or other sudden disruption in business operations beyond our control as a result of events such as acts of sabotage, terrorism or war, civil or political unrest, natural disasters, pandemic situations and large scale power outages. Some of these hazards may cause severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment or personal injury and loss of life and may result in suspension of operations or the shutdown of affected facilities.\n\u2022\nInformation technology security risks - As with all enterprise information systems, our information technology systems could be penetrated by outside parties\u2019 intent on extracting information, corrupting information, or disrupting business processes. Our systems have in the past been, and likely will in the future be, subject to unauthorized access attempts. Unauthorized access could disrupt our business operations and could result in failures or interruptions in our computer systems and in the loss of assets and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure, or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential information about the Company, our employees, our vendors, or our customers, could result in litigation, violations of various data privacy regulations in some jurisdictions, and also potentially result in liability to us. While we have taken measures to assess the requirements of, and to comply with the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation and other data privacy regulations, these measures may be challenged by authorities that regulate data-related compliance. We could incur significant expense in facilitating and responding to investigations and if the measures we have taken prove to be inadequate, we could face fines or penalties. This could damage our reputation, or otherwise harm our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\n\u2022\nLitigation and environmental risks - Current reserves relating to our ongoing litigation and environmental liabilities may ultimately prove to be inadequate.\n\u2022\nHazardous materials - We manufacture and transport certain materials that are inherently hazardous due to their toxic or volatile nature. While we take precautions to handle and transport these materials in a safe manner, if they are mishandled or released into the environment, they could cause property damage or result in personal injury claims against us.\n\u2022\nEnvironmental compliance - We are subject to extensive federal, state, local, and foreign environmental and safety laws, regulations, directives, rules and ordinances concerning, among other things, emissions in the air, discharges to land and water, and the generation, handling, treatment, disposal and remediation of hazardous waste and other materials. We may face liability arising out of the normal course of business, including alleged personal injury or property damage due to exposure to chemicals or other hazardous substances at our current or former facilities or chemicals that we manufacture, handle or own. We take our environmental responsibilities very seriously, but there is a risk of environmental impact inherent in our manufacturing operations and transportation of chemicals. Any substantial liability for environmental damage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\u2022\nCompliance with Laws and Regulations: The global regulatory environment is becoming increasingly complex and requires more resources to effectively manage, which may increase the potential for misunderstanding or misapplication of regulatory standards.\n\u2022\nWorkforce - The inability to recruit and retain key personnel or the unexpected loss of key personnel may adversely affect our operations. In addition, our future success depends in part on our ability to identify and develop talent to succeed senior management and other key members of the organization.\nTechnology Risks:\n\u2022\nTechnological change - Our ability to compete successfully depends in part upon our ability to maintain a superior technological capability and to continue to identify, develop and commercialize new and innovative, high value-added products for existing and future customers. Our investment in the discovery and development of new pesticidal active ingredients for FMC Agricultural Solutions relies on discovery of new chemical molecules. Such discovery processes depend on our scientists being able to find new molecules, which are novel and outside of patents held by others, and such molecules being efficacious against target pests without creating an undue risk to human health and the environment, and then meeting applicable regulatory criteria.\n\u2022\nFailure to make process improvements - Failure to continue to make process improvements to reduce costs could impede our competitive position.\n\u2022\nPatents of competitors - Some of our competitors may secure patents on production methods or uses of products that may limit our ability to compete cost-effectively.\nPortfolio Management and Integration Risks:\n\u2022\nPortfolio management risks - We continuously review our portfolio which includes the evaluation of potential business acquisitions that may strategically fit our business and strategic growth initiatives. If we are unable to successfully integrate and develop our acquired businesses, we could fail to achieve anticipated synergies which would include expected cost savings and revenue growth. Failure to achieve these anticipated synergies, could materially and adversely affect our financial results. In addition to strategic acquisitions we evaluate the diversity of our portfolio in light of our objectives and alignment with our growth strategy. In implementing this strategy we may not be successful in separating underperforming or non-strategic assets. The gains or losses on the divestiture of, or lost operating income from, such\nassets (e.g., divesting) may affect the Company\u2019s earnings. Moreover, we may incur asset impairment charges related to acquisitions or divestitures that reduce earnings. Significant effort will likely be required to ensure that the right mix of resources are trained, engaged and focused on achieving business objectives while adhering to our core values of safety, ethics and compliance.\n\u2022\nIntellectual property - Our patents cover many of our products, manufacturing processes, and product uses, as well as many aspects of our research and development activities supporting our new product pipeline. Patents are granted by individual jurisdictions and the duration of our patents depends on their respective jurisdictions and payment of annuities. Our future performance will depend on our ability to address patent expirations through effective portfolio life cycle management for our high value assets.\n\u25e6\nSystem implementation and integration risks - Failure to successfully integrate the acquired DuPont Crop Protection Business and transition the management information systems of the DuPont Crop Protection Business from the ERP system provided under Transition Services Agreement by DuPont to a management information system integrated with FMC\u2019s legacy processes could result in interruption of operations or failure to achieve synergies we expect. This could cause our future results of operations to be materially worse than expected.\n\u2022\nMajor enterprise initiatives - We are working to spin off our FMC Lithium segment in parallel to the continued integration of the DuPont Crop Protection Business assets into FMC Agricultural Solutions as well as implement other major initiatives such as the migration to a single global instance of SAP S4 HANA. These three projects will place significant demands on certain functions who are heavily involved in all three projects, particularly finance and information technology. Failure to successfully execute such projects could materially and adversely affect our expected performance in FMC Agricultural Solutions and/or FMC Lithium.\n\u2022\nPotential tax implications of FMC Lithium separation - We have received an opinion from outside counsel to the effect that the spin-off of FMC Lithium as a distribution to our stockholders qualifies as a non-taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The opinion is based on certain assumptions and representations as to factual matters from both FMC and FMC Lithium, as well as certain covenants by those parties. The opinion cannot be relied upon if any of the assumptions, representations or covenants is incorrect, incomplete or inaccurate or is violated in any material respect. The opinion of counsel is not binding upon the IRS or the courts and there is no assurance that the IRS or a court will not take a contrary position. It is possible that the IRS or a state or local taxing authority could take the position that aforementioned transaction results in the recognition of significant taxable gain by FMC, in which case FMC may be subject to material tax liabilities.\nFinancial Risks:\n\u2022\nCyclicality - We may experience seasonal variations in the demand for our products given the nature of the crop protection market and the geographic regions in which we operate.\n\u2022\nAccess to debt and capital markets - We rely on cash generated from operations and external financing to fund our growth and working capital needs. Limitations on access to external financing could adversely affect our operating results. Moreover, interest payments, dividends and the expansion of our business or other business opportunities may require significant amounts of capital. We believe that our cash from operations and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet these needs in the foreseeable future. However, if we need external financing, our access to credit markets and pricing of our capital will be dependent upon maintaining sufficient credit ratings from credit rating agencies and the state of the capital markets generally. There can be no assurances that we would be able to obtain equity or debt financing on terms we deem acceptable, and it is possible that the cost of any financings could increase significantly, thereby increasing our expenses and decreasing our net income. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or raise adequate external financing, including as a result of significant disruptions in the global credit markets, we could be forced to restrict our operations and growth opportunities, which could adversely affect our operating results.\n\u2022\nCredit default risks - We may use our existing revolving credit facility to meet our cash needs, to the extent available. In the event of a default in this credit facility or any of our senior notes, we could be required to immediately repay all outstanding borrowings and make cash deposits as collateral for all obligations the facility supports, which we may not be able to do. Any default under any of our credit arrangements could cause a default under many of our other credit agreements and debt instruments. Without waivers from lenders party to those agreements, any such default could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to operate.\n\u2022\nExposure to global economic conditions - Deterioration in the global economy and worldwide credit and foreign exchange markets could adversely affect our business. A worsening of global or regional economic conditions or financial markets could adversely affect both our own and our customers' ability to meet the terms of sale or our suppliers' ability to perform all their commitments to us. A slowdown in economic growth in our international markets, or a deterioration of credit or foreign exchange markets could adversely affect customers, suppliers and our overall business there. Customers in weakened economies may be unable to purchase our products, or it could become more expensive for them to purchase imported products in their local currency, or sell their commodities at prevailing international prices, and we may be unable to collect receivables from such customers.\n\u2022\nForeign exchange rate risks - We are an international company and face foreign exchange rate risks in the normal course of our business. We are particularly sensitive to the Brazilian real, the euro, the Indian rupee, the Chinese yuan, the Mexican peso, and the Argentine peso. Our acquisition of the DuPont Crop Protection Business has significantly expanded our operations and sales in certain foreign countries and correspondingly may increase our exposure to foreign exchange risks.\n\u2022\nUncertain tax rates - Our future effective tax rates may be materially impacted by numerous items including: a future change in the composition of earnings from foreign and domestic tax jurisdictions, as earnings in foreign jurisdictions are typically taxed at different rates than the United States federal statutory rate; accounting for uncertain tax positions; business combinations; expiration of statute of limitations or settlement of tax audits; changes in valuation allowance; changes in tax law; currency gains and losses; and the potential decision to repatriate certain future foreign earnings on which United States or foreign withholding taxes have not been previously accrued.\n\u2022\nUncertain recoverability of investments in long-lived assets - We have significant investments in long-lived assets and continually review the carrying value of these assets for recoverability in light of changing market conditions and alternative product sourcing opportunities.\n\u2022\nPension and postretirement plans - Obligations related to our pension and postretirement plans reflect certain assumptions. To the extent our plans' actual experience differs from these assumptions, our costs and funding obligations could increase or decrease significantly.", "PERMNO": 19166, "SIC": 2870, "TIC": "FMC"}
