{"cik": "1703038", "company": "NRC GROUP HOLDINGS CORP.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-25", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following risk factors apply to our business and operations. These risk factors are not exhaustive, and investors are encouraged to perform their own investigation with respect to our business, financial condition and prospects. We may face additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, which may also impair our business. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes to the financial statements included elsewhere in this Report.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe are subject to complex environmental laws, rules and regulations, including international laws, rules and regulations, that can adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of doing business.\nOur operations, and those of others in our businesses, are subject to extensive federal, state, provincial and local environmental laws, rules and regulations in both the United States and internationally, including those relating to:\n\u25cf oil spill response\u037e\n\u25cf hazardous and non-hazardous waste generation, treatment, transportation, storage and disposal\n\u25cf air emissions\u037e\n\u25cf wastewater discharge\u037e\n\u25cf the cleanup of soil\u037e\n\u25cf groundwater contamination\u037e and\n\u25cf the manning, construction and operation of vessels.\nWhile increasing environmental regulation often presents new business opportunities for us, it often also results in increased operating and compliance costs. Efforts to conduct our operations in compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, including environmental laws, rules and regulations, require programs to promote compliance, such as training employees and customers, purchasing health and safety equipment and in some cases hiring outside consultants and lawyers. Even with these programs, we, and other companies in our businesses, are occasionally faced with governmental enforcement proceedings, which can result in fines or other sanctions and require expenditures for remedial work, and private litigation. We are now, and may in the future be, a defendant in lawsuits brought by parties alleging environmental damage, personal injury and/or property damage, which may result in us being required to pay significant amounts. Even if we comply with all applicable environmental laws and regulations, we might not be able to obtain requisite permits from applicable governmental authorities to extend or modify such permits to fit our business needs.\nConversely, relaxation of environmental regulations and less aggressive enforcement of these regulations could decrease demand for our emergency response services and/or increase costs without a commensurate increase in revenue. For example, demand for our Domestic Standby Services segment is dependent upon regulations promulgated under OPA-90, international conventions and, to a lesser extent, local regulations. There can be no assurance that oil spill regulation will not be relaxed or enforcement of existing or future regulation will not become less stringent.\nWe cannot be certain that existing laws, rules and regulations as currently interpreted or reinterpreted in the future, or future laws, rules and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe could incur liability, including under environmental laws, rules and regulations, in connection with providing spill response services.\nWe may incur increased legal fees and costs in connection with providing spill response services. Although the services provided by us are generally exempt in the United States from liability under the CWA, this exemption might not apply to our own actions and omissions in providing spill response services if we are found to have been grossly negligent or to have engaged in willful misconduct, or if we have failed to provide these services consistent with applicable regulations and directives under the CWA. In addition, the exemption under the federal CWA would not protect a company against liability for personal injury or wrongful death, or against prosecution under other federal or state laws. Although most of the states within the United States in which we provide services have adopted similar exemptions, several states have not. If a court or other applicable authority were to determine that we do not benefit from federal or state exemptions from liability in providing emergency response services, we could be liable, together with the local contractor and the responsible party, for any resulting damages, including damages caused by others. In the international market, we do not benefit from the spill response liability protection provided by the CWA and therefore are subject to the liability terms and conditions negotiated with our international clients.\nIf Congress repeals or increases the $75.0 million cap for non-reclamation liabilities under OPA-90 or otherwise scales back the protections afforded to contractors thereunder, there may be increased exposure for remediation work and the cost for securing insurance for such work may become prohibitively expensive. Without affordable insurance and appropriate legislative regulation limiting liability, drilling, exploration, remediation and further investment in oil and gas exploration in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico may be discouraged and thus reduce the demand for our services.\nWe could incur liability under environmental laws, rules and regulations in connection with providing waste disposal services.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations impose liability and responsibility on present and former owners, operators or users of facilities and sites for contamination at such facilities and sites without regard to fault or knowledge of contamination. In the past, practices have resulted in releases of regulated materials at and from certain of our facilities, or the disposal of regulated materials at third-party sites, which require investigation and remediation and may potentially result in claims of personal injury, property damage and damages to natural resources. In addition, we occasionally evaluate various alternatives with respect to our facilities, including possible dispositions or closures. Investigations undertaken in connection with these activities may lead to discoveries of contamination that must be remediated, and closures of facilities might trigger compliance requirements that are not applicable to operating facilities. We are currently conducting remedial activities at certain of our facilities and paying a portion of the remediation costs at certain sites owned by third parties. Based on available information, we believe these remedial activities will not result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, result of operations and cash flows. However, these activities or the discovery of previously unknown conditions could result in material costs.\nIn addition, we are required to obtain governmental permits to provide our services, operate our facilities, including all of our landfills, and expand our operations. Although we are committed to compliance and safety, we may not, either now or in the future, be in full compliance at all times with such laws, rules and regulatory requirements or be able to renew or procure governmental permits. As a result, we could be required to incur significant costs to maintain or improve our compliance with such requirements. Moreover, failure to comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations may also result in administrative and civil penalties, criminal sanctions or the suspension or termination of our operations.\nFrom time to time, we have paid fines or penalties in governmental environmental enforcement proceedings, usually involving our waste treatment, storage and disposal facilities. Although none of these fines or penalties has had a material adverse effect upon us, we might in the future be required to make substantial expenditures as a result of governmental proceedings which would have a negative impact on our earnings. Furthermore, regulators have the power to suspend or revoke permits or licenses needed for operation of our plants, equipment and vehicles based on, among other factors, our compliance record. Suspension or revocation of permits or licenses would impact our operations and could have a material impact on our financial results.\nExisting or future laws and regulations related to greenhouse gases and climate change could have an impact on our business and may result in additional compliance obligations on us and our customers.\nChanges in environmental requirements related to greenhouse gases and climate change may impact demand for our services. For example, oil and natural gas exploration and production may decline as a result of environmental requirements, including land use policies responsive to environmental concerns. However, increased environmental requirements could also increase demand for our services. Local, state and federal agencies have been evaluating climate-related legislation and other regulatory initiatives that would restrict emissions of greenhouse gases in areas in which we conduct business. To a certain extent our business depends on the level of activity in the oil and natural gas industry, existing or future laws and regulations related to greenhouse gases and climate change, including incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources, could have an impact on our business if such laws or regulations reduce demand for oil and natural gas.\nWe are subject to complex laws, rules and regulations relating to our securities, including rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC, that can adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of doing business.\nWe are also subject to laws and regulations enacted by national, regional and local governments, including non-U.S. governments, relating to our securities. In particular, we are required to comply with certain SEC and other legal requirements. Compliance with, and monitoring of, applicable securities laws and regulations may be difficult, time consuming and costly. Those laws and regulations and their interpretation and application may also change from time to time and those changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, investments and results of operations. In addition, a failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations, as interpreted and applied, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur businesses are subject to operational and safety risks.\nThe provision of services to our customers by all of our business segments involves risks such as equipment defects, malfunctions and failures, employee and third-party negligence and natural disasters, any of which could potentially result in releases of hazardous materials, injury or death of our employees or a need to shut down or reduce operation of our facilities while remedial actions are undertaken. Our employees often work under potentially hazardous conditions. These risks expose us to potential liability for pollution and other environmental damages, personal injury, loss of life, business interruption and property damage or destruction. We must also maintain a solid safety record in order to remain a preferred supplier to our major customers.\nWhile we seek to minimize our exposure to such risks through comprehensive training programs, vehicle and equipment maintenance programs and insurance, such programs and insurance may not be adequate to cover all of our potential liabilities and such insurance may not in the future be available at commercially reasonable rates. If we were to incur substantial liabilities in excess of our policy limits or at a time when we were not able to obtain adequate liability insurance on commercially reasonable terms, our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected to a material extent.\nOur business requires the handling of dangerous substances. Improper handling of such substances could result in an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to unexpected occurrences related, or unrelated, to the routine handling of dangerous substances. A fire or other incident could impair the ability of one of more facilities to continue to perform normal operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, result of operations and cash flows. Improper handling of these substances could also violate laws and regulations resulting in fines and/or suspension of operations.\nThe handling of hazardous material subjects us to potential liability claims by employees, contractors, property owners, neighbors and others. There can be no assurance that our existing liability insurance is adequate to cover claims asserted against us or that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future. Adverse rulings in judicial or administrative proceedings could also have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to maintain an acceptable safety record may have an adverse impact on our ability to retain and acquire customers.\nOur current and prospective customers consider safety and reliability a primary concern in selecting a service provider. We must maintain a record of safety and reliability that is acceptable to our customers. Should this not be achieved, our ability to retain current customers and attract new customers may be adversely affected.\nWe may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve from the combination of NRC and Sprint.\nPrior to the formation of NRC Group, NRC and Sprint each operated as independent companies. Our management is in the process of integrating the separate businesses, technologies, organizations, procedures and policies and operations into an integrated company, which is necessary to fully realize the expected benefits of the combination between NRC and Sprint. The integration process may prove to be more complex and time-consuming and require more resources and effort than currently expected. In addition, we may not recognize the intended cost savings and other synergies that we anticipated at the time of the combination.\nA majority of our board of directors has been nominated by JFLCo pursuant to the Investor Rights Agreement (as defined below). In addition, entities affiliated with JFLCo beneficially own a majority of our common stock.\nPursuant to the Investor Rights Agreement, dated as of October 17, 2018, by and among us, JFL Partners and JFLCo (the \u201cInvestor Rights Agreement\u201d), JFLCo has the right to nominate directors to our board of directors based on JFL\u2019s proportional ownership interest in our common stock. \u201cJFL\u201d shall mean JFLCo, together with JFL Partners, JFL-NRCG III and JFL-NRCG IV and each of their respective affiliates, subsidiaries and managed funds and its and their successors and assigns (other than us and our subsidiaries). As of December 31, 2018, JFL beneficially owned 67.0% of our common stock, authorizing JFLCo to nominate five of our nine current directors. As such, JFLCo will have significant influence over our management and business affairs, and will be able to control matters requiring stockholder approval.\nJFLCo, through its control of our board of directors, may control actions to be taken by us, our board of directors and our stockholders, including approval of significant corporate transactions, mergers and sales of substantially all of our assets. There may be times when JFLCo\u2019s interests may not align with our interests or current business strategies, and/or those of our other stockholders.\nOur acquisitions and integration of businesses could adversely impact our future results.\nWe continuously evaluate potential acquisition candidates and from time to time acquire companies that we believe will strategically fit into our business and growth objectives. We are unable to predict the size, timing and number of future acquisitions we may complete, if any. In addition, we may incur expenses associated with sourcing, evaluating and negotiating acquisitions (including those that are not completed), and we may also pay fees and expenses associated with financing acquisitions to investment banks and other advisors. Any of these amounts may be substantial, and together with the size, timing and number of acquisitions we pursue, may negatively impact and cause significant volatility in our financial results. If we are unable to successfully integrate and develop acquired businesses, we could fail to achieve anticipated synergies and cost savings, including any expected increases in revenues and operating results, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nIn addition, we have assumed, and may in the future assume, liabilities of the acquired company. While we retain third-party advisors to consult on potential liabilities related to these acquisitions, there can be no assurances that all potential liabilities will be identified or known to us. If there are unknown liabilities or other obligations, our business could be materially affected.\nInvestment in new business strategies and initiatives present risks not originally contemplated.\nIn 2018 we completed three acquisitions. Some of these acquisitions may not be directly linked to existing business lines or activities. Each acquisition or investment involves unique risks and uncertainties, including distraction of our management from current operations, insufficient revenue to offset liabilities assumed and expenses associated with the plans or acquisitions, inadequate return of capital and unidentified issues not discovered in due diligence. These acquisitions and investments may involve illiquid securities that are difficult to divest without a substantial loss in value. As a result of the risks inherent in new ventures, there can be no assurance that any such venture will be successful, or that new ventures will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nTax interpretations and recently enacted comprehensive U.S. tax reform legislation may adversely affect us.\nOn December 22, 2017, the legislation commonly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law, making substantial changes to U.S. tax law, including a reduction in the corporate tax rate, a limitation on deductibility of interest expense, a limitation on the use of net operating losses to offset future taxable income, the allowance of immediate expensing of capital expenditures and deemed repatriation of foreign earnings. We have determined this legislation will have significant effects on us, more specifically the limitation on deductibility of interest expense and deemed repatriation of foreign earnings.\nTax interpretations, regulations and legislation in the various jurisdictions in which we operate are subject to measurement uncertainty and the interpretations can impact net income, income tax expense or recovery, and deferred income tax assets or liabilities. Tax rules and regulations, including those relating to foreign jurisdictions, are subject to interpretation and require judgment by us that may be challenged by the taxation authorities upon audit. Although we believe our assumptions, judgements and estimates are reasonable, changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of any tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements.\nWe may experience risks from our international operations.\nOur ability to compete in the international market may be adversely affected by foreign government regulations that favor or require the awarding of contracts to local competitors, or that require non-U.S. Citizens to employ citizens of, or purchase supplies from, a particular jurisdiction. Further, our foreign subsidiaries may face governmentally imposed restrictions on their ability to transfer funds to their parent company. Activity outside the United States involves additional risks, including the possibility of:\n\u25cf United States embargoes or restrictive actions by U.S. and foreign governments that could limit our ability to provide services in foreign countries\u037e\n\u25cf a change in, or the imposition of, withholding or other taxes on foreign income, tariffs or restrictions on foreign trade and investment\u037e\n\u25cf limitations on the repatriation of earnings or currency exchange controls and import/export quotas\u037e\n\u25cf local cabotage and local ownership laws and requirements\u037e\n\u25cf nationalization, expropriation, asset seizure, blockades and blacklisting\u037e\n\u25cf limitations in the availability, amount or terms of insurance coverage\u037e\n\u25cf loss of contract rights and inability to enforce contracts\u037e\n\u25cf political instability, war and civil disturbances or other risks that may limit or disrupt markets, such as terrorist attacks, piracy and kidnapping\u037e\n\u25cf fluctuations in currency exchange rates, hard currency shortages and controls on currency exchange that affect demand for our services and profitability\u037e\n\u25cf potential noncompliance with a wide variety of laws and regulations, such as the FCPA, and similar non-U.S. laws and regulations, including the U.K. Bribery Act 2010\u037e\n\u25cf labor strikes and volatility in labor costs\u037e\n\u25cf changes in general economic and political conditions\u037e and\n\u25cf difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations.\nAny of the foregoing or other factors associated with doing business abroad could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur global operations may be subject to certain foreign currency risks.\nWe earn revenues, pay expenses, own assets, incur liabilities and enter contracts using currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, we are exposed to certain foreign currency, interest rate, fixed income, equity, and commodity price risks. In fiscal 2018, we recorded approximately 6.0% of our revenues outside of the United States. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenues, income and expenses, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. Therefore, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies in countries where we operate will affect our results of operations and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies.\nFluctuations in the commodity market related to the demand and production of oil, gas and other energy-related commodities may affect our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nDeclines in the production level of oil, gas and other energy-related commodities could have significant adverse effects on us. Commodity demand fluctuates for several reasons, including, but not limited to, changes in market and economic conditions, the impact of weather, levels of domestic and international production, domestic and foreign governmental regulation, national protectionism policies and trade disputes. Volatility of commodity demand, which may lead to a reduction in production or supply of the commodity, may negatively impact the demand for our services. A decline in the demand for these services may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nA cybersecurity incident could negatively impact our business and our relationships with customers.\nWe use computers in substantially all aspects of our business operations and also mobile devices and other online activities to connect with our employees and customers. Such uses give rise to cybersecurity risks, including security breach, espionage, system disruption, data corruption or theft and inadvertent release of information. Our business involves the storage and transmission of numerous classes of sensitive and/or confidential information and intellectual property including, but not limited to, private information about employees and financial and strategic information about the company and our business partners. Furthermore, as we pursue our strategy to grow through acquisitions and new initiatives that expand our operations and improve our cost structure, we are also expanding and improving our information technologies, resulting in a larger technological presence and corresponding exposure to cybersecurity risk. If we fail to assess and identify cybersecurity risks associated with acquisitions and new initiatives, we may become increasingly vulnerable to such risks. Additionally, while we have implemented measures to prevent security breaches and cyber incidents, our preventative measures and incident response efforts may not be entirely effective.\nThe theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation, release of sensitive and/or confidential information or intellectual property, or interference with our information technology systems or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely on could result in business disruption, negative publicity, brand damage, violation of privacy laws, loss of customers, potential liability and competitive disadvantage.\nCertain adverse conditions may require, and future conditions might require, us to make substantial write-downs in our assets, which would adversely affect our balance sheet and results of operations.\nWe review our long-lived tangible and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. We also test our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually on December 31, or when events or changes in the business environment indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit may exceed our fair value. Based on those results, in 2016 we recorded approximately $17.1 million of impairment of goodwill in the International Services segment. If conditions in any of the businesses in which we compete were to deteriorate, we could determine that certain of our assets were impaired, and we would then be required to write-off all or a portion of our costs for such assets. Any significant write-offs would adversely affect our balance sheet and results of operations.\nNatural disasters or other catastrophic events could negatively affect our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nNatural disasters such as hurricanes, typhoons or earthquakes could negatively affect our operations and financial performance. While natural disasters do create a demand for our services, such events could result in physical damage to one or more of our facilities or equipment, the temporary lack of an adequate work force in a market and the temporary disruption in rail or truck transportation services that we rely on to deliver waste to our facilities. These events could prevent or delay shipments and reduce both volumes and revenue. Weather conditions and other event driven special projects also cause interim variations in our results. We may be required to suspend operations in some or all of our locations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nIncreases in transportation costs may adversely affect our business and reduce our earnings.\nWe maintain a vast transportation network and an extensive fleet of transportation vehicles. A significant increase in market prices for vehicles or fuel could adversely affect our business through higher transportation costs and reduce our operating margins and reported earnings.\nOur insurance coverage may be inadequate to protect us from the liabilities that could arise in our businesses, and we may be unable to obtain insurance policies on commercially favorable rates in the future.\nWe carry a range of insurance coverages that we believe are customary in our industry. Most of the insurance is obtained through third-party insurance programs, with premiums charged to participating businesses based on insured asset values. We participate in third-party sponsored health benefit plans for our participating employees and we are not self-insured. Although we maintain insurance coverage against the risks related to our businesses, risks may arise for which we may not be insured. Claims covered by insurance are subject to deductibles, the aggregate amount of which could be material. Insurance policies are also subject to compliance with certain conditions, the failure of which could lead to a denial of coverage as to a particular claim or the voiding of a particular insurance policy. There also can be no assurance that existing insurance coverage can be renewed at commercially reasonable rates or that available coverage will be adequate to cover future claims. If a loss occurs that is partially or completely uninsured, we could be exposed to substantial liability.\nOur substantial levels of outstanding indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to fulfill our obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had $351.4 million outstanding under the New Credit Facility, including our Revolver of $10.0 million. In the Consolidated Balance Sheets in our financial statements included in this Form 10-K, our outstanding debt is presented net of debt issuance costs of $7.8 million. In early October 2018, we obtained a $35.0 million incremental term loan and decreased the amount available under the revolving credit facility to $35.0 million. In addition we have approximately $4.9 million of letters of credit outstanding. Our substantial levels of outstanding debt may:\n\u25cf adversely impact our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes\u037e\n\u25cf require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to payment of principal and interest on our debt and fees on our letters of credit, which reduces the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes\u037e\n\u25cf subject us to the risk of increased sensitivity to interest rate increases based upon variable interest rates, including our senior secured term loan and borrowings (if any) under our New Credit Facility\u037e\n\u25cf increase the possibility of an event of default under the financial and operating covenant contained in our debt instruments\u037e and\n\u25cf limit our ability to adjust to rapidly changing market conditions, reduce our ability to withstand competitive pressures and make us more vulnerable to a downturn in general economic conditions of our business than our competitors with less debt.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of principal or interest with respect to our debt, including our borrowing under our New Credit Facility, and to pay fee obligations with respect to our letters of credit will depend on our ability to generate cash and our future financial results. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt and letter of credit fee obligations, we might be required to refinance all or a portion of our existing debt and letter of credit facilities or to obtain new or additional such facilities. However, we might not be able to obtain any such new or additional facilities on favorable terms or at all.\nDespite our substantial levels of outstanding debt and letters of credit, we could incur substantially more debt and letter of credit obligations in the future.\nAlthough our New Credit Facility contains restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions and the additional debt which we might incur in the future in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. In particular, we had available at December 31, 2018, up to an additional approximately $35.0 million for additional borrowings and letters of credit under our New Credit Facility. Our New Credit Facility also allows us to incur significant amounts of other debt from various other sources, including, without limitation, incremental revolving credit and term loan commitments under our New Credit Facility. These restrictions also do not prevent us from incurring obligations (such as operating leases) that do not constitute \u201cdebt\u201d or \u201cindebtedness\u201d as defined in the relevant agreements. To the extent we incur in the future additional debt and letter of credit or other obligations, the related risks would increase.\nThe covenants in our debt agreements restrict our ability to operate our business and might lead to a default under our debt agreements.\nOur New Credit Facility limits, among other things, our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to:\n\u25cf incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue certain types of preferred stock\u037e\n\u25cf pay dividends or make other distributions to our stockholders\u037e\n\u25cf purchase, prepay or redeem capital stock or subordinated indebtedness\u037e\n\u25cf make investments\u037e\n\u25cf create liens\u037e\n\u25cf incur restrictions on the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to us\u037e\n\u25cf sell assets, including capital stock of our subsidiaries\u037e\n\u25cf consolidate or merge with or into other companies or transfer all or substantially all of our assets\u037e and\n\u25cf engage in transactions with affiliates.\nAs a result of these covenants, we may not be able to respond to changes in business and economic conditions and to obtain additional financing, if needed, and we may be prevented from engaging in transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us. If the aggregate outstanding principal amount of revolving loans, together with certain letter of credit obligations and the outstanding principal amount of swingline loans under our New Credit Facility, exceeds 30% of the aggregate amount of revolving credit commitments then in effect, our New Credit Facility requires us to maintain certain financial ratios and satisfy certain other financial condition tests. Our ability to meet these financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control, and we may not be able to meet those tests. The breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our outstanding or future debt. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under such debts, including accrued interest or other obligations, to be immediately due and payable. If amounts outstanding under such debt were accelerated, our assets might not be sufficient to repay in full that debt and our other debt.\nOur New Credit Facility also contains cross-default and cross-acceleration provisions to other material debt instruments. Under these provisions, a default or acceleration under one other such instrument governing our debt may constitute a default under our other debt instruments (including our New Credit Facility) that contain cross-default and cross-acceleration provisions, which could result in the related debt and the debt under such other instruments becoming immediately due and payable. In such event, we would need to raise funds from alternative sources, which funds might not be available to us on favorable terms, on a timely basis or at all. Alternatively, such a default could require us to sell assets and otherwise curtail operations to pay our creditors. The proceeds of such a sale of assets, or curtailment of operations, might not enable us to pay all of our liabilities.\nOur inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could have an adverse effect on our business.\nAttracting and retaining skilled personnel across all of our business segments is an important factor in our future success. The market for the personnel employed is highly competitive, and we cannot be certain that we will be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel in the future.\nThe unplanned loss of our senior executives could affect our ability to manage our business profitably.\nWe depend on a small number of senior executives. Our future success will depend upon, among other things, our ability to retain these executives and to hire other highly qualified employees at all levels. We compete with other potential employers for employees, and we may not be successful in hiring and keeping the executives and other employees that we need. We do not have written employment agreements with certain of our officers and other key employees could leave us with little or no prior notice, either individually or as part of a group. Our loss of, or inability to hire, key employees could impair our ability to manage our business and direct its growth.\nWe rely on third-party contractors to provide important emergency response services to our customers.\nWe rely on independent contractors to provide services and support to our customers. While the use of independent contractors expands the reach and customer base for our services, the maintenance and administration of these relationships is costly and time consuming. If we do not enter into arrangements with these independent contractors on financially acceptable terms, these relationships may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors.\nThe environmental services and hazardous waste disposal industry is highly fragmented and competitive. Some of our competitors or potential competitors have greater financial or other resources than us and in some cases are government-supported. Our competitors may improve their competitive position in the respective end markets by successfully introducing new or substitute products, improving their processes or expanding their capacity. Furthermore, we operate in industries where capital investment is critical. We may not be able to obtain as much purchasing and borrowing leverage and access to capital as our competitors or potential competitors, which may impair our ability to compete against competitors or potential competitors.\nA violation of the FCPA and other anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws may adversely affect our business and operations.\nIn order to effectively compete in certain foreign jurisdictions, we seek to establish joint ventures with local operators or strategic partners. As a U.S. corporation, we are subject to the regulations imposed by the FCPA, which generally prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or maintaining business. We have adopted stringent procedures to educate our relevant workforce and enforce compliance with the FCPA, but we may be held liable for actions taken by our strategic or local partners, even though these partners may not be subject to the FCPA. Any determination that we have violated the FCPA could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur results of operations may fluctuate from quarter to quarter.\nOur operations can be affected by many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including the number and magnitude of emergency response events, the timing of commencement and completion of emergency response cleanup of major spills and other events, customers\u2019 decisions to undertake remedial projects, seasonal fluctuations due to weather and budgetary cycles influencing the timing of customers\u2019 spending for remedial activities, the timing of regulatory decisions relating to hazardous waste management projects, secular changes in the waste processing industry towards waste minimization, and the propensity for delays in the demand for remedial services. We do not control such factors and, as a result, our revenue and income can vary from quarter to quarter, and past financial performance for certain quarters may not be a reliable indicator of future performance for comparable quarters in subsequent years.\nA change in, or revocation of, our classification as an Oil Spill Removal Organization could result in a loss of business.\nWe are classified by the USCG as an OSRO. The USCG classifies OSROs based on their overall ability to respond to various types and sizes of oil spills. USCG-classified OSROs have a competitive advantage over non-classified service providers because customers of a classified OSRO may cite classified OSROs in their response plans in lieu of listing their oil spill response resources in filings with the USCG. A loss of our classification or changes in the requirements for classification could eliminate or diminish our ability to provide customers with this exemption. If this happens, our Domestic Standby Services segment could lose customers.\nIf activity in oil and gas exploration, development and production in the North Sea materially declines, our International Services segment\u2019s results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nCurrently a large portion of our International Services is located in the North Sea, which is known for its challenging and expensive conditions. Adverse weather conditions, such as extreme winter conditions, may interrupt or curtail our operations in the North Sea, or our customers\u2019 operations, cause supply disruptions or loss of productivity and may result in a loss of revenue or damage to our equipment and facilities, which may or may not be insured. If activity in oil and gas exploration, development and production in the North Sea materially declines, our International Services segment\u2019s results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. We cannot predict the levels of activity in these areas.\nThe waste management industry in which we participate is subject to significant economic and business risks.\nThe future operating results of our Sprint segment may be affected by such factors as our ability to utilize our facilities and workforce profitably in the face of price competition, maintain or increase market share in an industry which has in the past experienced significant downsizing and consolidation, realize benefits from cost reduction programs, invest in new technologies for treatment of oil and gas waste, generate incremental volumes of oilfield waste to be handled through our facilities from existing and acquired sales offices and service centers, obtain sufficient volumes of waste at prices which produce revenue sufficient to offset the operating costs of our facilities, minimize downtime and disruptions of operations and develop our field services business. In particular, lower industrial activity and deferred maintenance due to recessionary conditions have adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, the demand for our services. Our business is also cyclical to the extent that it is dependent upon a stream of waste from cyclical industries such as oil and gas. If those cyclical industries slow significantly, the business that we receive from them would likely decrease.\nIf our assumptions relating to expansion of our landfills should prove inaccurate, our results of operations and cash flow could be adversely affected.\nWhen we include expansion airspace in our calculation of available airspace, we adjust our landfill liabilities to the present value of projected costs for cell closure and landfill closure and post closure. It is possible that our estimates or assumptions could ultimately turn out to be significantly different from actual results. In some cases we may be unsuccessful in obtaining an expansion permit or we may determine that an expansion permit that we previously thought was probable has become unlikely. To the extent that such estimates, or the assumptions used to make those estimates, prove to be significantly different than actual results, or our belief that we will receive an expansion permit changes adversely in a significant manner, our landfill assets, including the assets incurred in the pursuit of the expansion, may be subject to impairment testing. Furthermore, lower prospective profitability may result due to increased interest accretion and depreciation or asset impairments related to the removal of previously included expansion airspace. In addition, if our assumptions concerning expansion airspace should prove inaccurate, certain of our cash expenditures for closure of landfills could be accelerated and adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow.\nWe may be unable to obtain permits for construction of our new waste disposal facilities.\nWe have one pending permit for a non-hazardous waste disposal site in the Permian Basin. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining the permit in a timely manner or at all. If we are not successful in receiving the permit, we may not be able to expand our waste disposal capacity to serve existing and new customers in the Delaware and Midland Basins. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, result of operations and cash flows.\nOur waste disposal services business is geographically concentrated\u037e Therefore, our results of operations may be adversely affected by unfavorable conditions in these local markets.\nOur Sprint segment\u2019s operations are subject to local economic, competitive and other conditions prevailing in Texas, Oklahoma and New Mexico. Our Sprint segment\u2019s waste disposal services depend substantially on general economic conditions and consumer spending habits in these local markets. Any decline in the general economic conditions or decreased consumer spending in these markets may have a negative impact our results of operations.\nIn connection with the audit of our fiscal year 2018 financial statements, the auditors identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. A failure to properly remediate a material weaknesses or the inability to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, may impact our ability to accurately report our financial results.\nMaterial weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting with respect to our financial statement close process, information technology general controls and journal entries existed as of December 31, 2018. Specifically, it was identified that the global IT director, as well as certain finance and information technology third party contractors have administrator and super user access rights and/or maintain access to develop changes to certain applications. Further, it was identified that we did not maintain adequate controls over the financial statement close process, including controls to identify and assess whether financial statement account balances are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, nor did we maintain adequate segregation of duties over the review and approval of journal entries. To remediate these material weaknesses, management has hired additional financial accounting and reporting personnel and provided additional training, and started to implement additional security access, program management controls and more stringent review procedures over journal entries.\nUnder standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, a material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented, detected or corrected on a timely basis.\nIf additional material weaknesses in the internal control over financial reporting are discovered or occur in the future, there exists a risk that our financial statements may contain material misstatements that are unknown to us at that time, and such misstatements could require us to restate our financial results. Our management or our independent registered public accounting firm may identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the future. The existence of material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting may affect our ability to accurately report our financial results, prevent fraud or file required SEC reports in a timely manner, which may cause our investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and may adversely affect our reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nPursuant to the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the \u201cJOBS Act\u201d), our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d) for so long as we are an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, and generally requires in the same report a report by our independent registered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We are required to provide management\u2019s attestation on internal controls effective with respect to the year ending December 31, 2019 in accordance with applicable SEC guidance. However, under the JOBS Act, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act until we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d We could be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following June 28, 2022, the fifth anniversary of the IPO, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our prior second fiscal quarter, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period.\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. An \u201cemerging growth company\u201d can therefore delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have chosen not to \u201copt out\u201d of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised with different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.\nRisks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters\nOur business would be adversely affected if we failed to comply with the Jones Act\u2019s (as defined below) restrictions on ownership of our capital stock by non-U.S. Citizens.\nA substantial portion of our operations is conducted in the U.S. coastwise trade and is subject to the requirements of certain provisions of U.S. cabotage laws that impose certain restrictions on the ownership and operation of vessels in the U.S. coastwise trade (such laws are principally contained in 46 U.S.C. Chapters 121, 505 and 551 and the related regulations and are commonly referred to collectively as the \u201cJones Act\u201d). The Jones Act restricts waterborne transportation of merchandise and passengers for hire by water or by land and water, either directly or via a foreign port, between points in the United States and certain of its island territories and possessions to U.S.-flag vessels meeting certain requirements, including ownership and control by U.S. Citizens (within the meaning of the Jones Act). We are responsible for monitoring the non-U.S. Citizen ownership of our common stock and other equity interests to ensure compliance with the Jones Act. We could lose the privilege of owning and operating vessels in the U.S. coastwise trade if non-U.S. Citizens were to own or control, in the aggregate, more than 25% of our common stock or other equity interests in us. Such a loss would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Violations of the Jones Act would result in us losing eligibility to engage in the U.S. coastwise trade, the imposition of substantial penalties against us, including fines and seizure and forfeiture of our vessels, and/or the temporary or permanent inability to document our vessels in the United States with coastwise endorsements, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Although we currently believe we meet the requirements to engage in the U.S. coastwise trade, and there are provisions in our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the \u201ccharter\u201d) and our Amended and Restated Bylaws (the \u201cbylaws\u201d) that were designed to assist us in complying with these requirements, there can be no assurance that we will be in compliance with the Jones Act in the future.\nRepeal, amendment, suspension or non-enforcement of the Jones Act would result in additional competition for a substantial portion of our services and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to the Jones Act, which restricts the transportation of merchandise and passengers for hire by water or by land and water, either directly or via a foreign port, between points in the United States and certain of its island territories and possessions to U.S.-flag vessels that meet certain requirements, including that they are built in the United States and owned by U.S. Citizens (within the meaning of the Jones Act), and manned by predominantly U.S. citizen crews. During the past several years, interest groups have lobbied the U.S. Congress, and legislation has been introduced, to repeal certain provisions of the Jones Act to facilitate foreign-flag vessel competition for trades and cargoes currently reserved for U.S.-flag vessels under the Jones Act. We expect that continued efforts will be made to modify or repeal the Jones Act. In addition, the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security may waive the requirement for using U.S.-flag vessels with coastwise endorsements in the U.S. coastwise trade in the interest of national defense. In addition, our advantage as a U.S. Citizen operator of Jones Act vessels could be eroded by periodic efforts and attempts by foreign interests to circumvent certain aspects of the Jones Act. In addition, maritime transportation services are currently excluded from the General Agreement on Trade in Services (\u201cGATS\u201d) and are the subject of reservations by the United States in the North American Free Trade Agreement (\u201cNAFTA\u201d) and other international free trade agreements. If maritime cabotage services were included in the GATS, NAFTA or other international trade agreements, or if the restrictions contained in the Jones Act were otherwise repealed, altered or waived, the transportation of cargo and passengers between U.S. ports could be could be opened to foreign-flag, foreign-built vessels or foreign-owned vessels. To the extent such foreign competition is permitted from vessels built in lower-cost shipyards with promotional foreign tax incentives or favorable tax regimes and crewed by non-U.S. Citizens with lower wages and benefits than U.S. citizens, such competition could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur common stock is subject to restrictions on ownership by non-U.S. Citizens, which could require divestiture by non-U.S. Citizen stockholders and could have a negative impact on the transferability of our common stock, its liquidity and market value, and upon a change of control of the Company.\nCertain of our operations are conducted in the U.S. coastwise trade and are governed by U.S. federal laws commonly known as the Jones Act. The Jones Act restricts the transportation of merchandise and passengers for hire by water or by land and water, either directly or via a foreign port, between points in the United States and certain of its island territories and possessions, to U.S.-flag vessels that meet certain requirements, including that they are built in the United States, owned and operated by U.S. Citizens (within the meaning of the Jones Act), and manned by predominantly U.S. Citizen crews. We could lose the privilege of owning and operating vessels in the U.S. coastwise trade and may become subject to penalties and risk seizure and forfeiture of our U.S.-flag vessels if non-U.S. Citizens were to own or control, in the aggregate, more than 25% of any class or series of our capital stock. Such loss would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe charter and the bylaws authorize, with respect to any class or series of our capital stock, certain rules, policies and procedures, including procedures with respect to transfer of shares, to assist in monitoring and maintaining compliance with the Jones Act\u2019s U.S. citizenship requirements, which may have an adverse effect on holders of shares of the common stock.\nIn order to provide a reasonable margin for compliance with the Jones Act, the charter contains provisions that limit the aggregate percentage beneficial ownership by non-U.S. Citizens of any class or series of our capital stock (including the common stock) to 24% of the outstanding shares of each such class or series to ensure that ownership by non-U.S. Citizens will not exceed the maximum percentage permitted by the Jones Act (presently 25%).\nThe aggregate percentage of non-U.S. Citizen ownership of our outstanding common stock is expected to fluctuate based on daily trading, and may increase above the 24% maximum permitted percentage. At and during such times that the 24% permitted percentage of shares of common stock held by non-U.S. Citizens is reached, we will be unable to issue any further shares of common stock to non-U.S. Citizens (including any shares issuable upon exercise of the public warrants) or permit transfers of common stock to non-U.S. Citizens. Any issuance or transfer of shares in excess of such permitted percentage shall be ineffective against us, and neither we nor our transfer agent are required to register such purported issuance or transfer of shares or be required to recognize the purported transferee or owner as our stockholder for any purpose whatsoever except to exercise our remedies. Any such excess shares in the hands of a non-U.S. Citizen shall not have any voting or dividend rights. In addition, we, in our discretion, are entitled to redeem all or any portion of such shares most recently acquired (as determined by our board of directors in accordance with guidelines that are set forth in the charter), by non-U.S. Citizens, in excess of such maximum permitted percentage for such class or series at a redemption price based on a fair market value formula that is set forth in the charter, which is to be paid by the issuance of redemption warrants (the \u201cRedemption Warrants\u201d) permitting the holders to receive shares of common stock in the future when the receipt thereof would not violate the charter at an exercise price of $0.01 per share. In the event that we determine that Redemption Warrants would be treated by the USCG as capital stock, or if we are unable to issue the Redemption Warrants for any other reason, we may redeem the excess shares with cash, promissory notes or a combination of both at the discretion of our board of directors.\nAs a result of these provisions, a purported stockholder who is a non-U.S. Citizen may not receive any return on its investment in any such excess shares it purportedly purchases or owns, as the case may be, and it may sustain a loss. Further, we may have to incur additional indebtedness, or use available cash (if any), to fund all or a portion of such redemption, in which case our financial condition may be materially weakened. The existence and enforcement of these requirements could have an adverse impact on the liquidity or market value of our equity securities in the event that U.S. Citizens were unable to transfer shares in the Company to non-U.S. Citizens. Furthermore, under certain circumstances, this ownership restriction could discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of the Company. So that we may monitor and maintain our compliance with the Jones Act, provisions in the charter permit us to require that owners of any shares of our capital stock provide confirmation of their citizenship. In the event that a person does not submit such documentation to us, those provisions provide us with certain remedies, including the suspension of voting, dividend and distribution rights and treatment of such person as a non-U.S. Citizen unless and until we receive the requested documentation confirming that such person is a U.S. Citizen. As a result of non-compliance with these provisions, an owner of the shares of our common stock may lose significant rights associated with those shares.\nIf, for any reason, we are unable to effect such a redemption when such ownership of shares by non-U.S. Citizens is in excess of 25% of the common stock, or otherwise prevent non-U.S. Citizens in the aggregate from owning shares in excess of 25% of any class or series of our capital stock, or we fail to exercise our redemption rights because we are unaware that such ownership exceeds such percentage, we will likely be unable to comply with the Jones Act and will likely be required by the applicable governmental authorities to suspend our operations in the U.S. coastwise trade. Any such actions by governmental authorities would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Relating to an Investment in Our Securities\nWe do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nWe do not expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock. Any future dividend payments are within the absolute discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, working capital requirements, capital expenditure requirements, financial condition, level of indebtedness, contractual restrictions with respect to payment of dividends, business opportunities, anticipated cash needs, provisions of applicable law and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant.\nA market for our securities may not continue, which would adversely affect the liquidity and price of our securities.\nThe price of our securities may fluctuate significantly due to general market and economic conditions. An active trading market for our securities may never develop or, if developed, it may not be sustained. In addition, the price of our securities can vary due to general economic conditions and forecasts, our general business condition and the release of our financial reports. Additionally, if our securities are not listed on, or become delisted from, the NYSE American for any reason, and are quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board, an interdealer automated quotation system for equity securities that is not a national securities exchange, the liquidity and price of our securities may be more limited than if we were quoted or listed on the NYSE American or another national securities exchange. You may be unable to sell your securities unless a market can be established or sustained.\nIf we do not continue to satisfy the NYSE American continued listing requirements, our common stock and warrants could be delisted from the NYSE American.\nThe listing of our common stock on the NYSE American is contingent on our compliance with the NYSE American\u2019s conditions for continued listing. We cannot assure you that we will be able to meet those listing conditions. If the NYSE American delists our common stock or warrants from trading on its exchange due to our failure to meet the NYSE American\u2019s listing conditions, we and our securityholders could face significant material adverse consequences, including:\n\u25cf a limited availability of market quotations for our securities;\n\u25cf a determination that our common stock is a \u201cpenny stock\u201d which will require brokers trading in our securities to adhere to more stringent rules, possibly resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities;\n\u25cf a limited amount of analyst coverage; and\n\u25cf a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nThe price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile.\nFluctuations in the price of our securities could contribute to the loss of all or part of your investment. If an active market for our securities develops and continues, the trading price of our securities could be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. Any of the factors listed below could have a material adverse effect on your investment in our securities and our securities may trade at prices significantly below the price you paid for them. In such circumstances, the trading price of our securities may not recover and may experience a further decline.\nFactors affecting the trading price of our securities may include:\n\u25cf market conditions affecting the environmental and emergency solutions industries\u037e\n\u25cf quarterly variations in our results of operations\u037e\n\u25cf changes in government regulations\u037e\n\u25cf the announcement of acquisitions by us or our competitors\u037e\n\u25cf changes in general economic and political conditions\u037e\n\u25cf volatility in the financial markets\u037e\n\u25cf results of our operations and the operations of others in our industry\u037e\n\u25cf changes in interest rates\u037e\n\u25cf threatened or actual litigation and government investigations\u037e\n\u25cf the addition or departure of key personnel\u037e\n\u25cf actions taken by our stockholders, including the sale or disposition of their shares of our common stock\u037e and\n\u25cf differences between our actual financial and operating results and those expected by investors and analysts and changes in analysts\u2019 recommendations or projections.\nBroad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of our securities irrespective of our operating performance. The stock market in general has experienced price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the particular companies affected. The trading prices and valuations of these stocks, and of our securities, may not be predictable. A loss of investor confidence in the market for retail stocks or the stocks of other companies which investors perceive to be similar to us could depress our stock price regardless of our business, prospects, financial conditions or results of operations. A decline in the market price of our securities also could adversely affect our ability to issue additional securities and our ability to obtain additional financing in the future.\nAnti-takeover provisions contained in the charter and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt.\nThe charter and the bylaws contain provisions that could have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or changes in our management without the consent of our board of directors. These provisions include:\n\u25cf no cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates\u037e\n\u25cf the exclusive right of our board of directors, subject to the rights of the holders of any outstanding series of preferred stock, to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors or the resignation, death, or removal of a director with or without cause by stockholders, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors\u037e\n\u25cf the ability of our board of directors to determine whether to issue shares of our preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders\u037e\n\u25cf the requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called, subject to the rights of the holders of any outstanding series of preferred stock, only by the chairman of the board of directors, the chief executive officer, the board of directors, or JFLCo (provided that JFL beneficially owns, in the aggregate, at least 50% in voting power of our stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors) which may delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors\u037e\n\u25cf limiting the liability of, and providing indemnification to, our directors and officers\u037e\n\u25cf controlling the procedures for the conduct and scheduling of stockholder meetings, subject to the rights of the holders of any outstanding series of preferred stock\u037e\n\u25cf providing for a staggered board, in which the members of the board of directors are divided into three classes to serve for a period of three years from the date of their respective appointment or election\u037e\n\u25cf granting the ability, subject to the rights of the holders of any outstanding series of preferred stock and the rights granted to JFLCo under the Investment Rights Agreement, to remove directors with or without cause by the affirmative vote of a majority in voting power of the outstanding shares of Company common stock entitled to vote thereon (provided that at any time JFL beneficially owns, in the aggregate, less than 50% of the voting power of Company common stock, any such director or all such directors may be removed only for cause by the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of the then outstanding shares of Company common stock)\u037e\n\u25cf requiring the affirmative vote of at least 66-2/3% of the voting power of the outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, to amend the bylaws or the charter (provided that JFL beneficially owns, in the aggregate, at least 10% of voting power of our stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors)\u037e and\n\u25cf advance notice procedures that stockholders must comply with in order to nominate candidates to our board of directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of the Company.\nThese provisions, alone or together, could delay hostile takeovers and changes in control of the Company or changes in our board of directors and management. As a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (\u201cDGCL\u201d), which prevents some stockholders holding more than 15% of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of substantially all of our outstanding common stock. Any provision of the charter, bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\nThe charter designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees.\nThe charter provides that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will, with certain limited exceptions, be the sole and exclusive forum for any stockholder (including any beneficial owner) to bring (a) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company, (b) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of the Company to us or our stockholders, (c) any action asserting a claim against us, our directors, officers or employees arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or the charter or bylaws, or (d) any action asserting a claim against us, our directors, officers or employees governed by the internal affairs doctrine.\nAny person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in shares of our capital stock is deemed to have notice of and consented to the foregoing provisions. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find this choice of forum provision inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about us, our business or our market, or if they change their recommendations regarding our common stock adversely, the price and trading volume of our common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will rely in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. We do not control these analysts. Furthermore, if one or more of the analysts who may cover us downgrade or provide negative outlook on our stock or our industry, or the stock of any of our competitors, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price of our common stock could decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our business or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nWe are a holding company and we conduct all of our operations through our subsidiaries.\nOther than any cash we may retain, all of our assets will be held by our direct and indirect subsidiaries. We will rely on the earnings and cash flows of our subsidiaries, which will be paid to us by our subsidiaries, if and only to the extent available, in the form of dividends and other payments or distributions, to meet our debt service obligations. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments or distributions to us will depend on their respective operating results and may be restricted by, among other things, the laws of their jurisdiction of organization (which may limit the amount of funds available for the payment of dividends and other distributions to us), the terms of existing and future indebtedness and other agreements of our subsidiaries and the covenants of any future outstanding indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur.\nThere is no guarantee that the warrants will ever be in the money, and they may expire worthless\nThe exercise price for our warrants is $11.50 per share of common stock. There is no guarantee that the warrants will ever be in the money prior to their expiration, and as such, the warrants may expire worthless. In addition, our warrants were issued in registered form under a warrant agreement between us and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as warrant agent (the \u201cWarrant Agreement\u201d). The Warrant Agreement provides that the terms of the warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder to cure any ambiguity or correct any defective provision, but requires the approval by the holders of at least 65% of the then outstanding warrants to make any change that adversely affects the interests of the registered holders.\nHolders of our 7.00% Series A Convertible Cumulative Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (\u201cSeries A Convertible Preferred Stock\u201d) may be subject to tax if we make or fail to make certain adjustments to the conversion rate of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock even though you do not receive a corresponding cash distribution.\nThe conversion rate of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances, including the payment of cash dividends on our common stock. If the conversion rate is adjusted as a result of a distribution that is taxable to our common stockholders, such as a cash dividend, you may be deemed to have received a dividend subject to U.S. federal income tax without the receipt of any cash. In addition, a failure to adjust (or to adjust adequately) the conversion rate after an event that increases your proportionate interest in us could be treated as a deemed taxable dividend to you. If a fundamental change (as more fully described in the Certificate of Designations, Preferences, Rights and Limitations of 7.00% Series A Convertible Cumulative Preferred Stock of NRC Group Holdings Corp. (the \u201cCertificate of Designations\u201d)) occurs, under some circumstances, we will increase the conversion rate for shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock converted in connection with such fundamental change. If you are a holder of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and you are either a nonresident alien individual or foreign corporation (within the meaning of Sections 1441 and 1442 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), respectively), any deemed dividend may be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax at a 30% rate, or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable treaty, which may be set off against subsequent payments on the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock.\nIf you are a non-U.S. holder, dividends on our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock that are paid in shares may be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax in the same manner as a cash dividend, which the withholding agent might satisfy through a sale of a portion of the shares you receive as a dividend or through withholding of other amounts payable to you.\nWe may elect to pay dividends on our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock in shares of common stock rather than in cash.
