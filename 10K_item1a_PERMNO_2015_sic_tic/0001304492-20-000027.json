Risk Factors.\nYou should carefully consider the following risk factors, together with the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the \u201cAnnual Report\u201d) and our other reports and filings made with the SEC, in evaluating our business and prospects. If any of the risks discussed in this Annual Report occur, our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected, in which case the trading price of our common stock could decline significantly. Some statements in this Annual Report, including statements in the following risk factors, constitute forward-looking statements. Please refer to the section entitled \u201cCautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nRisks Related to Obtaining Broadband Licenses, the Retuning Process and the Use of Our Spectrum\nOur plans to commercialize our 900 MHz spectrum assets depend on our ability to qualify for and obtain broadband licenses from the FCC in accordance with the requirements of the Report and Order. If we are unable to obtain broadband licenses on favorable terms and on a timely basis, or at all, our business, liquidity, results of operations and prospects will be materially adversely affected.\nOur plans to commercialize our 900 MHz spectrum assets depend on our ability to obtain broadband licenses in accordance with the requirements of the Report and Order approved by the FCC in May 2020. The Report and Order establishes three general eligibility requirements to obtain a broadband license, which we refer to herein as (i) the \u201c50% Licensed Spectrum Test,\u201d (ii) the \u201c90% Broadband Segment Test\u201d and (iii) the \u201c240 Channel Requirement.\u201d We will need to satisfy all eligibility requirements in each county in the United States for which we desire to obtain a broadband license. Under the 50% Licensed Spectrum Test, we must demonstrate that we hold more than 50% of the licensed channels in the 900 MHz band in the applicable county. Under the 90% Broadband Segment Test, we must provide the FCC with a plan demonstrating that we hold, or have agreements with Covered Incumbents for, at least 90% of the licensed channels in the 6 MHz broadband segment designated by the FCC and within 70 miles of the county boundary. Under the 240 Channel Requirement, we must surrender 6 MHz of broadband or narrowband spectrum (or 240 channels) in the applicable county to the FCC. If we do not have a sufficient number of channels to satisfy any of these tests, we will be required to purchase the additional channels from incumbents in privately negotiated transactions, swap our existing channels with incumbents (including any required retuning of the incumbent radio systems), or effectively purchase channels not previously licensed by the FCC by making an Anti-Windfall payment. The amount of spectrum we will be required to purchase and/or swap and the amount of any Anti-Windfall payment will vary in each county based on our existing spectrum holdings in such county. Our ability to acquire and/or swap the additional spectrum necessary to secure broadband licenses in a desired county on a timely and cost-effective basis will depend on the incumbents who hold the additional spectrum we need to acquire or swap and their operations that we may need to retune or replace. Obtaining the required spectrum to qualify for broadband licenses may take longer and be more expensive than we currently anticipate. In addition, as discussed in more detail below, incumbents may elect not to sell or swap their existing channels on reasonable terms, or at all, and if we cannot satisfy the 90% Broadband Segment Test, we will not be able to utilize the mandatory retuning procedures the FCC established in the Report and Order. If we are unable to obtain broadband licenses on favorable terms and on a timely basis, or at all, our business, liquidity, results of operations and prospects will be materially adversely affected. In addition, significant costs or delays beyond what we have anticipated in our business plan will further delay us from commercializing our spectrum assets, and may require us to seek additional sources of capital and liquidity in order to carry out our business and plans, which could cause significant dilution to our existing stockholders. See the risk factor entitled \u201cWe may not be able to correctly estimate our operating expenses or future revenues, which could lead to cash shortfalls and require us to secure additional financing sooner than planned.\u201d\nThe mandatory retuning process established by the FCC in the Report and Order may not allow us to obtain broadband licenses from incumbents in a timely manner and on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nThe Report and Order establishes a market-driven, voluntary exchange process for clearing the channels in the broadband segment on a county-by-county basis. When we apply for a broadband license, we will need to demonstrate that we satisfy the 90% Broadband Segment Test. The fact that we will need to account for 90% of the licensed channels in the broadband segment before we can file for a broadband application, can lead to holdouts by Covered Incumbents. For example, a Covered Incumbent may demand compensation in an amount that is disproportionate to the cost of relocating its system or any reasonable reflection of the value of its spectrum holdings or may elect not to negotiate an agreement at all. In the Report and Order, the FCC has established the 90% Broadband Segment Test, which if satisfied, triggers a mandatory relocation process to help a broadband applicant clear the remaining channels in the broadband segment. There is no assurance, however, that we can swap or acquire sufficient channels, including by purchasing additional spectrum, swapping spectrum or entering into protective agreements with Covered Incumbents to satisfy the 90% Broadband Segment Test on a timely basis and on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Further, even if we satisfy the 90% Broadband Segment Test, as part of the mandatory retuning process we will be required to pay the costs associated with providing Covered Incumbents with comparable facilities and paying relocation costs.\nIn addition, the FCC has exempted channels from the mandatory relocation process that are being utilized by incumbents operating Complex Systems. The FCC defines a Complex System as a radio system that has 45 or more functionally integrated sites. The FCC exempted Complex Systems from the mandatory retuning requirements because retuning these systems could be more complex and disruptive to the incumbent operators than the systems operated by most other incumbents. Complex Systems are located in some of the largest business and population centers in the United States. Most are operated by electric utilities, including\nsome utilities that actively opposed 900 MHz broadband. This exemption effectively prevents us from obtaining broadband licenses in counties where these Complex Systems are located (or if a Complex System is being operated within 70 miles of a county boundary for which we are attempting to obtain a broadband license) without the incumbent\u2019s consent, which could be withheld for any reason, or for no reason. As a result, the incumbents operating Complex Systems can make demands that are not commercially reasonable (including the commercial terms of any long-term lease of our spectrum), delay their decision or refuse altogether. Our inability to obtain broadband licenses in counties where Complex Systems are currently being operated (or are being operated within 70 miles of a county boundary for which we are attempting to obtain a broadband license) could have a material adverse effect on our operations and business plan, our future prospects and opportunities and on our ability to develop a profitable business.\nThe members of the Association of American Railroads may delay or hinder our ability to commercialize broadband licenses.\nThe AAR holds a nationwide geographic license for six non-contiguous channels in the 900 MHz band, three of which are located within the broadband segment established by the FCC in the Report and Order. These channels are used by freight railroads for Advanced Train Control System operations. We recognized from the outset of the 900 MHz proceedings the importance of reaching agreements with the railroads about their relocation and worked with them throughout the FCC process. The Report and Order acknowledged an agreement reached between AAR and Anterix. Delays by members of the AAR in clearing their channels in the broadband segment could delay or hinder our ability to commercialize broadband licenses and the ability of our customers to deploy 3/3 MHz broadband networks in the affected area, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and business plan, our future prospects and opportunities and on our ability to develop a profitable business.\nWe may not be successful in commercializing our spectrum assets.\nWe have identified utilities and other critical infrastructure enterprises as our initial target customers. As of the date of this filing, we have not signed our first binding customer contract with a utility or other critical infrastructure enterprise for the long-term lease of our spectrum assets. Further, even though the FCC adopted the Report and Order, there is no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to commercialize our spectrum assets. For example, utilities or other critical infrastructure enterprises may not elect to lease any broadband licenses we secure on terms satisfactory to us, on a timely basis, or at all. Similarly, there is no assurance that utilities or other critical infrastructure customers will retain us for any other value-added engineering or commercial services we offer them. As a result, our prospects must be considered in light of the uncertainties, risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stages of implementing a new business plan and pursuing opportunities in highly competitive and rapidly developing markets.\nIn addition, under our current business plan, we intend to enter long-term leasing or other transfer arrangements for our spectrum assets with one customer, or a limited number of customers, in each geographic area. We also expect that our customers will bear the costs of deploying and operating their private broadband networks. As a result, many geographic areas may have only one or a limited number of potential customers and if we are not successful with this customer or customers, our spectrum may not be utilized and we will not be able to generate revenues from owning spectrum in that geographic area. In addition, even if we enter a long-term lease or transfer arrangement for a geographic area, that customer will typically require rights to all spectrum we have in that geographic area. Because of this, we may not have additional spectrum assets to lease in such geographical area to other potential customers. Further, other than our lease or transfer arrangements, we will not generate revenue from the operation of the broadband networks or technologies deployed by our customers. As a result, there is considerable uncertainty as to whether we can generate sufficient revenues to develop a profitable business from leasing or otherwise transferring our licensed 900 MHz spectrum.\nOur ability to successfully commercialize our spectrum assets will also depend on the availability of technology, products and solutions that can both utilize the broadband licenses we secure and satisfy our customers\u2019 demands. Our spectrum assets are located within the 3GPP global standard of Band 8 (also known as the E-GSM band, or 880 - 915 MHz paired with 925 - 960 MHz). Band 8 has been internationally approved and is currently being utilized with LTE broadband networks. However, we may be unable to convince chipmakers and other technology, product and solution manufacturers and vendors to develop the technology, products and solutions required to satisfy our customers\u2019 various use cases and meet the technical specifications established in the Report and Order. If such technologies, products and solutions are not available, or are significantly delayed, our customers may decide not to lease any broadband licenses we secure on acceptable terms, on a timely basis, or at all.\nFurther, our assessment that we should target utilities and other critical infrastructure entities as customers for our spectrum is based on our determination that these entities have regulatory and other incentives to install a significant number of new technologies, such as smart devices and sensors, that will generate an increasing amount of data that cannot be addressed well by their existing communication networks and systems. Our potential customers, however, are large organizations and a decision to implement private broadband networks, technologies and solutions is a significant decision and will require significant capital outlays. Any negotiation and contract process with these potential customers may take longer than we currently expect. In addition, there is no assurance that the governmental agencies that regulate these entities will allow them to pass the capital costs of implementing broadband networks, technologies and solutions utilizing our spectrum on to their ratepayers. In addition, although there is broad availability of broadband LTE, there is no assurance that our targeted customers will be able to utilize existing broadband networks, technologies and solutions with our spectrum without requiring modifications to existing equipment or engaging in product and/or service development efforts, any of which could result in deployment delays, require them or us to invest in technology or other development activities or otherwise adversely limit the potential benefits or value of our spectrum assets. If any of these risks occur, our current plans to\ncommercialize our spectrum assets may not be as valuable as we expect or may face significant delays, any of which would adversely affect our business, liquidity, results of operations and prospects.\nThe ongoing coronavirus outbreak could adversely impact our business, including our broadband licensing and commercialization efforts and our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nAny outbreak of contagious diseases or other adverse public health developments could have a material adverse effect on our business operations. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, a global pandemic. In an effort to contain and mitigate the spread of COVID-19, many countries, including the United States, have imposed various unprecedented responses, including government-imposed quarantines, restrictions on travel and business and government operations and other public health safety measures, resulting in, among other things, business closures and a substantial reduction in economic activity globally.\nOur plans to commercialize our 900 MHz spectrum assets to support the deployment of broadband networks, technologies and solutions depend on our ability to obtain broadband licenses in accordance with the requirements of the Report and Order. Reduced business operations may prevent us from timely and successfully negotiating and entering into agreements with incumbents and the FCC to acquire and/or swap the spectrum required to qualify for broadband licenses. The reduced business operations may hinder our efforts to timely and successfully commercialize any broadband licenses we secure for our targeted utility and critical infrastructure customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect individuals and businesses around the globe, we will likely experience disruptions that could severely impact our financial condition, business and/or ability to obtain and commercialize broadband licenses, including:\n\u00b7\ninterruption of key business activities due to illness, work from home mandates and/or quarantine of key individuals, including employees and service providers;\n\u00b7\ndelays and difficulties in obtaining broadband licenses in accordance with the requirements of the Report and Order;\n\u00b7\nslower business development and sales efforts due to uncertainty in the business climate of our targeted customers based on their concerns regarding the impact of COVID-19 or their reduced cash flows and resources to invest in long-term leases of any broadband licenses we secure;\n\u00b7\ndelays in necessary interactions with businesses, the FCC and other federal and state governmental agencies and other important parties due to limitations in employee resources, travel restrictions, forced furlough of employees or other interruptions in operations;\n\u00b7\ndelays in AAR clearing its operations from its channels in the broadband segment in critical counties;\n\u00b7\ndelays and difficulties in meeting performance or build-out requirements to retain and renew each broadband license we obtain;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in raising additional capital that may be needed to execute our long-term business plan due to the slowing economy and near term and/or long-term negative effects of the pandemic on the financial, banking and capital markets; and\n\u00b7\ninability to correctly estimate our operating expenses or future revenues, which could lead to cash shortfalls and require us to secure additional financing sooner than planned.\nThe global outbreak of the COVID-19 continues to rapidly evolve. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations is unknown and will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the ultimate geographic spread of the disease, the duration of the COVID-19 outbreak, travel restrictions, required social distancing, new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and any additional preventative and protective actions that governments, or we, may direct, which could result in an extended period of continued business disruption, reduced customer, collaborator or supplier traffic and reduced operations.\nOur initiatives with the federal and state agencies and commissions that regulate electric utilities may not be successful.\nOur targeted utility and critical infrastructure customers are highly regulated by both federal and state agencies. Electrical utilities, for example, are regulated by federal agencies including the Department of Energy, the Department of Homeland Security, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the National Institute of Standards and Technologies. We are working with each of these agencies to educate them about the potential benefits that private broadband LTE networks, technologies and solutions utilizing our spectrum assets can offer utilities. We are also working with state agencies and commissions who regulate the electrical utilities in their respective states, and who have a strong influence over electric utility buying decisions in their jurisdictions. Our goal with these state agencies and commissions is to gain their support for allowing utilities to pass the capital costs of leasing our spectrum assets and deploying private broadband LTE networks, technologies and solutions to ratepayers, including at a customary rate of return for the electric utility company. We are in the early stages of our initiatives with these federal and state agencies and commissions. We may not be successful in gaining support from these governmental bodies on a timely basis, or at all, which could hinder or delay our commercialization efforts with electric utilities and other critical infrastructure entities. If we do not gain support from these governmental bodies, our targeted critical infrastructure customers may not find it commercially feasible to license our spectrum assets.\nWe may not be able to maintain any broadband licenses that we obtain from the FCC.\nThe FCC issues each spectrum license for a fixed period, typically ten years in the case of the FCC licenses for the narrowband spectrum we currently hold and 15 years for any broadband licenses we intend to secure in the future. The Report and Order establishes \u201cperformance\u201d or build-out requirements that we will be required to meet to retain and renew any broadband licenses we obtain. Performance will be measured at the six- and twelve-year anniversaries of each broadband license. A failure to satisfy this requirement could result in the FCC\u2019s termination of a broadband license or refusal to renew a previously issued broadband license. In addition, under our business plan, we intend for our customers to be responsible to pay the build-out and operating costs of such broadband systems. Such build-out requirements could impose a significant expense and could cause potential customers to decide not to license broadband licenses from us, or to seek alternatives from other providers.\nGovernment regulations or actions taken by governmental bodies could adversely affect our business prospects, liquidity and results of operations.\nThe licensing and sale of spectrum assets, as well as the deployment and operation of wireless networks and technologies, are regulated by the FCC and, depending on the jurisdiction, by state and local regulatory agencies. In particular, the FCC imposes significant regulation on licensees of wireless spectrum with respect to how FCC licenses may be transferred or sold. The FCC also regulates how the spectrum is used by licensees, the nature of the services that licensees may offer and how the services may be offered, including resolution of issues of interference between spectrum bands. Failure to comply with FCC requirements applicable to a given licensee could result in revocation or non-renewal of the license, depending on the nature and severity of the non-compliance. If we, or any of the future licensees of our spectrum assets, fail to comply with applicable FCC regulations, we may be subject to sanctions or lose our FCC licenses, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, results of operations and prospects. The Report and Order also states that the FCC will evaluate the success of the realignment process in 2021 and will consider whether it should adopt additional mechanisms to facilitate broadband deployment. Additionally, although the Report and Order was adopted by a unanimous vote of the FCC Commissioners, like all FCC actions the approval of the Report and Order is subject to an appeal process through the filing of a Petition for Reconsideration within 30 days of publication of the Report and Order in the Federal Register.\nIn addition, the FCC and other federal, state and local governmental authorities could adopt new regulations or take actions, including imposing taxes or fees on our business that could have a materially adverse effect on our business, liquidity, results of operations and prospects. Further, the FCC or Congress may make additional spectrum available for communications services, which may result in the introduction of additional competitive entrants to the already crowded wireless communications marketplace in which we compete. For example, the federal government created and funded the First Responder Network Authority which the federal government authorized to help accomplish, fund and oversee the deployment of a dedicated Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network (\u201cNPSBN\u201d). The NPSBN may provide an additional source of competition to utilizing our 900 MHz spectrum assets by our targeted critical infrastructure and enterprise customers.\nThe value of our spectrum assets may fluctuate significantly based on supply and demand, as well as technical and regulatory changes.\nThe FCC spectrum licenses we hold are our most valuable asset. The value of our spectrum, however, may fluctuate based on various factors, including, among others:\n\u00b7\nthe cost and time required to comply with the FCC\u2019s requirements to obtain broadband licenses in the 900 MHz band, including purchasing additional spectrum and retuning and relocating incumbents;\n\u00b7\nour ability to enter long-term leases or transfer arrangements with our targeted critical infrastructure and enterprise customers on a timely basis and on commercially reasonable terms;\n\u00b7\npotential uses of our spectrum based on the Report and Order and available technology;\n\u00b7\nthe market availability of, and demand for, broadband spectrum;\n\u00b7\nthe demand for private broadband networks, technologies and solutions by our targeted critical infrastructure and enterprise customers; and\n\u00b7\nregulatory changes by the FCC to make additional spectrum available or to promote more flexible uses of existing spectrum in other bands.\nSimilarly, the price of any additional spectrum we desire to purchase to enable us to qualify for broadband licenses or our future business plans will also fluctuate based on similar factors. Any decline in the value of our spectrum or increases in the cost of the spectrum we acquire could have an adverse effect on our market value and our business and operating results.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe may not be able to correctly estimate our operating expenses or future revenues, which could lead to cash shortfalls, and require us to secure additional financing sooner than planned.\nWe have dedicated significant resources to support and pursue the FCC\u2019s approval of the Report and Order and to promote the benefits of deploying broadband systems to our targeted utility and critical infrastructure customers. We will need to continue to expend substantial resources for the foreseeable future to qualify for and obtain broadband licenses, including the costs related to retuning incumbent systems, purchasing additional spectrum from incumbents and/or making Anti-Windfall payments to the U.S. Treasury, and to commercialize our spectrum assets. We believe our existing cash will be sufficient to fund our planned operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months.\nOur budgeted expense levels are based in part on our expectations and assumptions regarding the timing and costs to qualify for and obtain broadband licenses and the demand by our targeted customers to utilize our spectrum assets to deploy broadband networks, technologies and solutions. However, we may not correctly predict the amount or timing of our future revenues and our operating expenses, which may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, and may be materially different than our announced plans and expectations. These factors include:\n\u00b7\nthe cost and time required to obtain broadband licenses, including the costs to retune and clear the 900 MHz band and to acquire additional spectrum from incumbents and/or to make Anti-Windfall payments;\n\u00b7\nour ability to qualify for and utilize the mandatory retuning process established by the Report and Order;\n\u00b7\nour ability to negotiate agreements with the operators of Complex Systems;\n\u00b7\nthe cost and time to promote, market and commercialize our spectrum assets, including the long sales cycle required to enter long-term lease arrangements with our targeted utility and critical infrastructure customers;\n\u00b7\nthe commercial terms, including the length of the lease and the timing of payments, in our future commercial arrangements with our targeted customers; and\n\u00b7\nthe costs associated with increasing the size of our commercial and spectrum acquisition and retuning organizations, including the costs to attract and retain personnel with the skills required to support our business plans.\nIn addition, other unanticipated costs may arise that we currently do not anticipate. Further, other unanticipated events may occur that reduce the amounts and delay the timing of our future revenues, including the potential impacts of COVID-19. We may not be able to adjust our operations in a timely manner to compensate for any shortfall in our revenues, delays in obtaining broadband licenses, delays in entering long-term leases for our spectrum or increases in the expenses required to secure broadband licenses and implement our commercialization and business plans. As a result, a significant shortfall in our planned revenues, a significant delay in obtaining broadband licenses and entering into long-term leases for our spectrum assets or significant increases in our planned expenses could have an immediate and material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, results of operations and prospects. In such case, we may be required to issue additional equity or debt securities or enter into other commercial arrangements sooner than anticipated to secure the additional financial resources to support our future operations and the implementation of our business plans. Such financing may result in dilution to stockholders, imposition of debt covenants and repayment obligations, or other restrictions that may adversely affect our business, prospects and results of operations. In addition, we may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans.\nWe have no operating history with our proposed business plan, which makes it difficult to evaluate our prospects and future financial results and our business activities, strategic approaches and plans may not be successful.\nAlthough we were incorporated in 1997, our business is now reliant on our ability to secure broadband licenses pursuant to the Report and Order approved by the FCC in May 2020 and to commercialize our spectrum assets to our targeted utility and critical infrastructure customers. There is no assurance that we will be able to secure broadband licenses on a timely basis and on commercially available terms, or at all. Further, we have not signed our first binding customer contract with an electric utility or other critical infrastructure enterprise for the long-term lease of our spectrum asset. As a result, the ability to forecast our future operating results is limited and subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including our ability to accurately forecast and estimate our future revenues and the expenses and time required to obtain broadband licenses and pursue our commercialization plans. We have encountered, and expect to continue to encounter, risks and uncertainties frequently experienced by new businesses in highly competitive, technical and rapidly changing markets. If our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties are incorrect, or if\nthere are adverse changes in our commercialization plans or opportunities or general economic conditions, or if we do not manage or address these risks and uncertainties successfully, our results of operations could differ materially and adversely from our expectations.\nAs a new and unproven business, any future success will depend, in large part, on our ability to, among other things:\n\u00b7\ncomply with the requirements and restrictions the FCC has established in the Report and Order to qualify for and obtain broadband licenses in key geographic areas on a timely and cost-effective basis;\n\u00b7\nsuccessfully commercialize our spectrum assets to our targeted utility and critical infrastructure customers on favorable terms, on a timely basis, or at all;\n\u00b7\nmanage any ongoing costs, obligations and liabilities related to the transfer of our TeamConnect and pdvConnect businesses;\n\u00b7\ncompete against other wireless companies, including the Tier 1 carriers, manufacturers and vendors who have significantly greater resources and pricing flexibility, long-term relationships with our targeted customers and greater political and regulatory influence;\n\u00b7\nsuccessfully convince chipmakers and other technology, product and solution manufacturers and vendors to develop the technology, products and solutions required to satisfy our customers\u2019 various use cases and meet the technical specifications established in the Report and Order; and\n\u00b7\nsuccessfully manage and grow our internal business, regulatory, technical and commercial operations in an efficient and cost-effective manner.\nAny failure to achieve one or more of these objectives could adversely affect our business, our results of operations and our financial condition.\nMany of the third parties who offer spectrum and communication technologies, products and solutions to our targeted customers have existing long-term relationships with these targeted customers and have significantly more resources and greater political and regulatory influence than we do, and we may not be able to successfully compete with these third parties.\nOur competitors include the Tier 1 carriers (Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile and Sprint), private radio operators and other public and private companies who supply communication networks, technologies, products and solutions to our targeted utility and critical infrastructure entities. Many of these competitors have significantly more resources, a longer track record of providing technologies, products and solutions to our targeted customers and greater political and regulatory influence than we do, all of which could prevent, delay or increase the costs of commercializing the broadband licenses we secure to our targeted customers. In addition, under our business plan, our targeted customers will be required to enter a long-term lease for our broadband spectrum and bear the cost of installing and operating the broadband networks, technologies and solutions utilizing our licensed spectrum, thereby requiring the replacement of some or all of their existing communication systems. Given these significant capital requirements, there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully commercialize our spectrum assets, especially in light of the competitive environment in which we operate and the wide variety of technologies, products and solutions offered by our competitors. Further, in the process of pursuing broadband licenses, we may be required to make significant concessions or contractual commitments, purchase additional spectrum or replacement communication systems or limit the use of our spectrum assets or restrict our pursuit of business opportunities to address the concerns expressed by incumbents and other interested parties.\nSome of our competitors, including the Tier 1 carriers, have significantly greater pricing flexibility, have taken steps and may decide to compete against us more aggressively. These and other competitors have developed or may develop technologies that directly compete with our solutions. If competitors offer services, technologies and solutions to our targeted customers at prices and terms that make the licensing of our spectrum assets unattractive, our ability to license our spectrum assets could be impaired. As a result, we may be unable to attract customers at prices or on terms that would be favorable, or at all, which could have an adverse effect on the growth of our revenues. In addition, we may not be able to fund or invest in certain areas of our business to the same degree as our competitors. Many have substantially greater product development and marketing budgets and other financial and personnel resources than we do. Many also have greater name and brand recognition and a larger base of customers than we have. Competition could increase our selling and marketing expenses and related customer acquisition costs. We may not have the financial resources, technical expertise or marketing and support capabilities to compete successfully.\nIf we are unable to attract new customers, our results of operations and our business will be adversely affected.\nAs of the date of this report, we have not recognized revenues from our targeted critical infrastructure and enterprise customers. Our targeted customers are large, heavily-regulated enterprises and our business plan requires these customers to commit to long-term leases of our spectrum. As a result, sales to our targeted customers will require significant time and costly sales efforts. These factors will also require us to increase the size, resources and costs of our business development, sales and marketing organization. In addition, numerous other factors, many of which are out of our control, may now or in the future impact our ability to acquire new customers, including not gaining support from governmental bodies that regulate our customers, potential customers\u2019 commitments to other providers, real or perceived costs of licensing our spectrum assets, our failure to expand, retain and motivate our sales and marketing personnel, our failure to develop or expand relationships with our targeted critical infrastructure and enterprise customers, negative media, industry or financial analyst commentary regarding us or our solutions, litigation and deteriorating general\neconomic conditions. Any of these factors could impact our ability to attract new customers to license our spectrum assets. As a result of these and other factors, we may be unable to attract enough customers to support our operating costs, which would harm our business.\nWe have had net losses each year since our inception and may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future.\nWe have incurred net losses each year since our inception and we expect to continue to incur significant net losses in the future for a number of reasons, including without limitation, the costs to obtain broadband licenses, including the costs to clear the 900 MHz band, the costs to promote and commercialize our spectrum assets to our targeted utility and critical infrastructure customers and the costs associated with the transfer of our TeamConnect and pdvConnect businesses. Additionally, we may encounter unforeseen operating expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may result in significant delays in our business plans, levels of revenue below our current expectations, or losses or expenses that exceed our current expectations. If our losses or expenses exceed our expectations or our revenue assumptions are not met in future periods, we may never achieve or maintain profitability in the future.\nOur ability to use our net operating losses to offset future taxable income, if any, may be subject to certain limitations.\nAs of March 31, 2020, we had approximately $125.5 million of federal net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforwards, expiring in various amounts from 2020 through 2038, to offset future taxable income and the remaining $86.6 million of which can be carried forward indefinitely but limited to 80% of future taxable income when used. In the United States, utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), and similar state provisions due to ownership change limitations that have occurred previously or that could occur in the future. The NOL carryforwards and certain other tax attributes of ours may also be subject to limitations as a result of ownership changes. If we were to lose the benefits of these loss carryforwards, our future earnings and cash resources would be materially and adversely affected. We have incurred net losses since our inception, and we anticipate that we will continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future; thus, we do not know whether or when we will generate the U.S. federal taxable income necessary to utilize our NOLs.\nThe transfer of our TeamConnect and pdvConnect businesses and our related restructuring plans may result in higher costs and lower revenues than expected and cause us not to achieve the expected long-term operational benefits.\nIn December 2018, our Board approved the transfer of our TeamConnect and pdvConnect businesses to help reduce our operating costs and to allow our management team and company to focus on our FCC initiatives and future broadband opportunities. Specifically, we entered into: (i) a Customer Acquisition and Resale Agreement with A BEEP on January 2, 2019, (ii) a Customer Acquisition, Resale and Licensing Agreement with Goosetown on January 2, 2019 and (iii) a MOU with the principals of Goosetown on December 31, 2018. Under the A BEEP and Goosetown Agreements, we agreed to: (i) transfer our TeamConnect customers located in the Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Houston and Phoenix metropolitan markets to A BEEP, (ii) transfer our TeamConnect customers located in the Baltimore/Washington DC, Philadelphia and New York metropolitan markets to Goosetown, (iii) provide A BEEP and Goosetown with access to our MotoTRBO Systems and (iv) grant A BEEP and Goosetown the right to resell access to our MotoTRBO Systems pursuant to separate Mobile Virtual Network Operation arrangements for a two-year period. We also granted Goosetown a license to sell the business applications we developed for our TeamConnect service.\nWe retained a number of significant obligations under the A BEEP and Goosetown agreements related to the TeamConnect and pdvConnect businesses. For example, we are obligated to continue operating the TeamConnect networks in the seven launched markets through January 2, 2021. We are also required to continue to pay the cell tower leases for the TeamConnect networks we deployed for the balance of the lease terms. We also retained customer billing and collection responsibility for the pdvConnect business. In addition, if A BEEP, Goosetown or the principals of Goosetown do not comply with their contractual obligations or otherwise fail to adequately provide service to the transferred customers, we may recognize less revenue and incur more costs from these arrangements than anticipated, including potential litigation or damage claims from the transferred customers. In such case, the transfer of our TeamConnect and pdvConnect businesses and our related restructuring plans may result in higher costs and lower revenues than expected and cause us not to achieve the expected long-term operational benefits. Further, following the transfer of the pdvConnect and TeamConnect businesses, our prospects and future results are reliant on the success of our efforts to secure broadband licenses and plans to commercialize our spectrum assets.\nOur reputation and business may be harmed, and we may be subject to legal claims if there is loss, disclosure, or misappropriation of, or access to, our, or our customers\u2019, information.\nWe make extensive use of online services and centralized data processing, including through third-party service providers. The secure maintenance and transmission of customer information is an important element of our operations. Our information technology and other systems, and those of our service providers or contract partners (including A BEEP, Goosetown and TeamConnect LLC), that maintain and transmit customer information, including location or personal information, may be compromised by a malicious third-party penetration of our network security, or that of our third-party service providers or contract partners, or impacted by unauthorized intentional or inadvertent actions or inactions by our employees, or by the employees of our third-party service providers or contract partners. Cyber-attacks, which include the use of malware, computer viruses and other means of disruption or unauthorized access, have increased in frequency, scope and potential harm in recent years. While, to date, we have\nnot been subject to cyber-attacks or other cyber incidents which, individually or in the aggregate, have been material to our operations or financial condition, the preventive actions we and our third-party service providers and contract partners take to reduce the risk of cyber incidents and protect information technology resources and networks may be insufficient to repel a major cyber-attack in the future. As a result, our customers\u2019 information may be lost, disclosed, accessed, used, corrupted, destroyed or taken without the customers\u2019 consent. Any significant compromise of our data or network security, failure to prevent or mitigate the loss of customer information and delays in detecting any such compromise or loss could disrupt our operations, impact our reputation and subject us to additional costs and liabilities, including litigation, which could produce material and adverse effects on our business and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Organization and Structure\nWe may change our operations and business strategies without stockholder consent.\nOur executive management team, with oversight from our Board, establishes our operational plans, our commercialization plans and our business strategies. Our Board and executive management team may make changes to or approve transactions that deviate from our current operations and strategies without a vote of, or prior notice to, our stockholders. This authority to change our operations, commercialization plans and business strategies could result in us conducting operational matters, making investments, pursuing spectrum opportunities, or implementing business or growth strategies in a manner different than those that we are currently pursuing. Under any of these circumstances, we may expose ourselves to different and more significant risks, decrease our revenues or increase our expenses and financial requirements, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on our executive officers and key personnel.\nOur success depends to a significant degree upon the contributions of our executive officers and key personnel, who have unique experience and expertise in retuning and clearing spectrum to obtain FCC licenses. Although we have adopted a severance plan for our executive officers, we do not otherwise have long-term employment agreements with any of our executive officers or key personnel. There is no guarantee that these individuals will remain employed with us. In addition, we have not obtained and do not expect to obtain key man life insurance that would provide us with proceeds in the event of the death or disability of any of our executive officers or key personnel. If any of our executive officers or key personnel were to cease employment with us, our operating results and the implementation of our commercial and business terms could suffer. Further, the process of attracting and retaining suitable replacements for our executive officers and key personnel would result in transition costs and would divert the attention of other members of our senior management team from our existing operations. As a result, the loss of services from our executive officers or key personnel or a limitation in their availability could materially and adversely impact our business, prospects and results of operations. Further, such a loss could be negatively perceived in the capital markets.\nWe will need to continue to expand our organization and we may experience difficulties in managing this growth, which could disrupt our operations.\nAs we pursue broadband licenses and implement our commercialization plans, we expect to need additional managerial, operational, sales, marketing, financial, legal and other resources. Our management may need to divert its attention away from its day-to-day activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing these growth activities. We may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations, which may result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, operational mistakes, loss of business opportunities, loss of employees and reduced productivity among remaining employees. Our expected growth could require significant capital expenditures and may divert financial resources from other projects, such as deploying broadband systems to our targeted utility and critical infrastructure customers. If our management is unable to effectively manage our growth, our expenses may increase more than expected or budgeted, our ability to generate and/or grow revenue could be reduced and we may not be able to implement our currently anticipated business strategy. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize our spectrum assets and compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively manage any future growth. Failure to manage this growth could disrupt our business operations and negatively impact our ability to achieve success.\nIf we fail to implement and maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately determine our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, our stockholders could lose confidence in our financial results, which would materially and adversely affect our value and our ability to raise any required capital in the future.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud. We discovered in the past and may discover in the future areas of our internal controls that need improvement or additional documentation. For example, in connection with preparing our financial statements for the quarter ended June 30, 2018, we determined that we incorrectly interpreted the effective date of a change in the accounting treatment of our net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) in accordance with the new tax law provisions in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. This error was the result of an inadequate design of controls pertaining to our review and analysis of changing tax legislation, which represented a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls. As a result, we filed restated financial statements for the quarterly period ended December 31, 2017 and for the year ended March 31, 2018. In addition, in preparing our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2019, we determined that we had improper segregation of duties and other design gaps caused by user access deficiencies within the design of our information technology controls that support our financial reporting\nprocesses, and that this deficiency represented a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. As of March 31, 2020, we had remediated both of these material weaknesses. We cannot be certain that we will be successful in implementing or maintaining effective internal controls for all financial periods. As we grow our business, our internal controls will become more complex, and we will require significantly more resources to ensure our internal controls remain effective. The existence of any material weakness or significant deficiency in the future may require management to devote significant time and incur significant expense to remediate any such material weaknesses or significant deficiencies and management may not be able to remediate any such material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in a timely manner. In addition, the existence of any material weakness in our internal controls could also result in errors in our financial statements that could require us to restate our financial statements, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and cause stockholders to lose confidence in our reported financial information, all of which could materially and adversely affect our value and our ability to raise any required capital in the future.\nChanges in accounting rules, assumptions and/or judgments could materially and adversely affect us.\nAccounting rules and interpretations for certain aspects of our operations are highly complex and involve significant assumptions and judgments. Our reported financial statements have been and will continue to be based on our assumptions and judgments, and any changes in these assumptions or judgments could have a material impact on our results of operations and the other information contained in our financial statements. The complexities of these assumptions and judgments could also lead to a delay in the preparation and dissemination of our financial statements or could subject our financial statements to restatement if our independent auditors, the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) or we determine such assumptions or judgments must be changed. Furthermore, changes in accounting rules and interpretations could significantly impact our financial statements. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in restating prior period financial statements. Any of these circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have a concentration of risk related to the pdvConnect accounts receivable from a third-party carrier and failure to fully collect outstanding balances from this carrier may adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe historically offered pdvConnect to customers indirectly through two domestic Tier 1 carriers. As of March 31, 2020, we had accounts receivable balances owed to us by one domestic Tier 1 carrier representing approximately 39% of our accounts receivable balances. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the credit risk, historical trends and other information, as well as for any specific instances we become aware of that may preclude us from reasonably assuring collection on outstanding balances. Determining the allowance for doubtful accounts is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates. A determination that requires a change in our estimates for the accounts receivable from this carrier, or a failure by this carrier to pay a significant portion of its outstanding accounts receivable balances, could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nWe have a limited trading history and there is no assurance that a robust market in our common stock will develop or be sustained.\nSince our common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market in 2015, we have had limited daily trading volume. We cannot assure you that a more active or liquid trading market for our common stock will develop, or will be sustained if it does develop, either of which could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock, our ability to raise capital in the future and the ability of stockholders to sell their shares at the volume, prices and times desired. In addition, the risks and uncertainties related to our ability to obtain broadband licenses and our proposed business strategies makes it difficult to evaluate our business, our prospects and the valuation of our Company, which limits the liquidity and volume of our common stock and may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nOur common stock prices may be volatile, which could cause the value of our common stock to decline.\nThe market price of our common stock may be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations. Some of the factors that could negatively affect or result in fluctuations in the market price of our common stock include:\n\u00b7\nthe timing and costs of securing broadband licenses;\n\u00b7\nour ability to enter into contracts with our targeted critical infrastructure and enterprise customers on favorable terms, or at all;\n\u00b7\nmarket reaction to any changes in our business plans or strategies;\n\u00b7\nany unexpected costs or liabilities associated with the transfer of the TeamConnect and pdvConnect businesses;\n\u00b7\nadditions or departures of any of our executive officers or key personnel;\n\u00b7\nactions by our stockholders;\n\u00b7\nspeculation in the press or investment community;\n\u00b7\ngeneral market, economic and political conditions, including an economic slowdown or dislocation in the global credit markets;\n\u00b7\nour operating performance and the performance of other similar companies;\n\u00b7\nchanges in accounting principles, judgments or assumptions; and\n\u00b7\npassage of legislation or other regulatory developments that adversely affect us or our industry.\nConcentration of ownership will limit your ability to influence corporate matters.\nBased on our review of publicly available filings as of May 15, 2020, funds affiliated with Owl Creek Asset Management (\u201cOwl Creek\u201d) beneficially owned approximately 30.5% and the other holders of our common stock who have made filings with the SEC beneficially own, in the aggregate, a total of approximately 26% of our outstanding shares of common stock, and together with Owl Creek, approximately 56.5% of our outstanding shares of common stock. Specifically, based on publicly available filings as of May 15, 2020: funds affiliated with Pacific Investment Company owned approximately 7.9% of our outstanding common stock; funds affiliated with Lomas Capital Management LLC owned approximately 7.8% of our outstanding common stock; funds affiliated with American Financial Group Inc. owned approximately 5.2% of our outstanding common stock and funds affiliated with TPG Group Holdings (SBS) Advisors, Inc. owned approximately 5.1% of our outstanding common stock. Although we are not aware of any voting arrangements between these stockholders, our significant stockholders can determine (if acting together) or significantly influence (if acting as a group of two or more): (i) the outcome of any corporate actions submitted by our Board for approval by our stockholders and (ii) any proposals or director nominees submitted by a stockholder. Further, they could place significant pressure on our Board to pursue corporate actions, director candidates and business opportunities they identify. For example, we are engaged in cooperative discussions with Owl Creek regarding Owl Creek\u2019s interest in nominating an individual to our Board. In addition, in its Schedule 13D/A filed with the SEC on May 5, 2020, Owl Creek reported that it expects to continue to engage in cooperative discussions with our management and Board concerning ways to work together to achieve our strategic objectives. Owl Creek and our other significant stockholders could effectively block a proposed sale of the company, even if recommended by our Board. Alternatively, these stockholders could place pressure on our Board to pursue a sale of the company or its assets. As a result of this concentration of ownership, our other stockholders may have no effective voice in our corporate actions or the operations of our business, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe are a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d and may elect to comply with reduced public company reporting requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies, which could make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d (as defined under Section 12-b2 of the Exchange Act) meaning that we are not an investment company, an asset-backed issuer or a majority-owned subsidiary of a parent company and had either (i) a public float of less than $250 million as of the last business day of the most recently completed second fiscal quarter or (ii) if the public float was less than $700 million, had annual revenues of less than $100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year. Smaller reporting companies are permitted to provide simplified executive compensation disclosure in their filings; certain smaller reporting company are exempt from the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (\u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d) requiring that independent registered public accounting firms provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting; and they have certain other decreased disclosure obligations in their SEC filings, including, among other things, only being required to provide two years of audited financial statements in annual reports. For as long as we continue to be a smaller reporting company, we expect that we will take advantage of the reduced disclosure obligations available to us as a result of those respective classifications. Decreased disclosure in our SEC filings as a result of our having availed ourselves of scaled disclosure may make it harder for investors to analyze our results of operations and financial prospects. If investors find our common stock less attractive as a result of any choices to reduce future disclosure we may make, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nIf securities or industry analysts cease publishing, research or reports, or publish unfavorable research or reports, about us, our business, our market or our prospects, or if they change their recommendations regarding our stock adversely, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced, in part, by the research and reports that industry or financial research analysts publish about us, our business, our market or our prospects. We do not have any control over these analysts. If securities or industry analysts who provide coverage, or who initiate coverage in the future, downgrade our stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our market or our prospects, our stock price will likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which might cause our stock price and any trading volume to decline.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future.\nWe currently intend to retain our existing cash and our future earnings, if any, to finance the development and expansion of our business, securing broadband licenses and pursuing our commercialization of broadband licenses. Therefore, we do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. Any future determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of our Board and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, restrictions contained in any financing instruments and such other factors as our Board deems relevant in its discretion. Accordingly, you may need to sell your shares of our common stock to realize a return on your investment, and you may not be able to sell your shares at or above the price you paid for them.\nFuture sales of our common stock, or preferred stock, or of other securities convertible into our common stock or preferred stock, could cause the market value of our common stock to decline and could result in dilution of your shares.\nOur Board is authorized, without stockholder approval, to permit us to issue additional shares of common stock or to raise capital through the creation and issuance of preferred stock, other debt securities convertible into common stock or preferred stock, options, warrants and other rights, on terms and for consideration as our Board in its sole discretion may determine. In April 2020, we filed a shelf registration statement (the \u201cShelf Registration Statement\u201d) on Form S-3 with the SEC that was declared effective by the SEC on April 20, 2020, which permits us to offer up to $150 million of common stock, preferred stock and warrants in one or more offerings and in any combination, including in units from time to time. In April 2020, we entered into an Amended and Restated Controlled Equity OfferingSM Sales Agreement and an Amended and Restated Sales Agreement (collectively, the \u201cSales Agreements\u201d) with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. and B. Riley FBR, Inc., respectively (collectively, the \u201cAgents\u201d), and registered the sale of up to an aggregate of $50,000,000 in shares of our common stock in at-the-market sales transactions pursuant to the Sales Agreements under the Shelf Registration Statement. Our Sales Agreement is intended to provide us with additional flexibility to access the capital markets by selling registered shares under the Shelf Registration Statement. In addition, we have filed registration statements on Form S-8 to register the total number of shares of our common stock that may be issued under our 2014 Stock Plan, including the equity awards issued to our executive officers and directors. As of May 15, 2020, there are outstanding options to purchase 1,849,913 shares of our common stock and restricted stock unit agreements for 606,810 shares of our common stock and 1,053,832 shares remaining available for issuance under our 2014 Stock Plan, all of which are registered for sale on currently effective Forms S-8.\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock, including sales by our officers, directors or 5% and greater stockholders, or of preferred stock could cause the market price of our common stock to decrease significantly. We cannot predict the effect, if any, of future sales of our common stock, or the availability of our common stock for future sales, on the value of our common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock by any one or more of our large stockholders, or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nFuture offerings of debt securities or preferred stock, which would rank senior to our common stock in the event of our bankruptcy or liquidation, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nIn the future, we may attempt to increase our capital resources by making offerings of debt securities or otherwise incurring debt. In the event of our bankruptcy or liquidation, holders of our debt securities may be entitled to receive distributions of our available assets prior to the holders of our common stock. In addition, we may offer preferred stock that provides holders with a preference on liquidating distributions or a preference on dividend payments or both or that could otherwise limit our ability to pay dividends or make liquidating distributions to the holders of our common stock. Although we have no present plans to do so, our decision to issue debt securities or to issue preferred stock in any future offerings or otherwise incur debt may depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control. As a result, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings, and investors in our common stock bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of our common stock and/or diluting their ownership interest in us.\nCertain anti-takeover defenses and applicable law may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us.\nCertain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as amended (the \u201camended and restated certificate of incorporation\u201d) and amended and restated bylaws, as amended (the \u201camended and restated bylaws\u201d), could discourage, delay, or prevent a merger, acquisition, or other change of control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares. These provisions also could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for our common stock, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. These provisions, among other things:\n\u00b7\nallow the authorized number of directors to be changed only by resolution of our Board;\n\u00b7\nauthorize our Board to issue, without stockholder approval, preferred stock, the rights of which will be determined at the discretion of the Board and that, if issued, could operate as a \u201cpoison pill\u201d to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer to prevent an acquisition that our Board does not approve;\n\u00b7\nestablish advance notice requirements for stockholder nominations to our Board or for stockholder proposals that can be acted on at stockholder meetings; and\n\u00b7\nlimit who may call a stockholders meeting.\nIn addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \u201cDGCL\u201d). In general, Section 203 of the DGCL prevents an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d (as defined in the DGCL) from engaging in a \u201cbusiness combination\u201d (as defined in the DGCL) with us for three years following the date that person becomes an interested stockholder unless one or more of the following occurs:\n\u00b7\nBefore that person became an interested stockholder, our Board approved the transaction in which the interested stockholder became an interested stockholder or approved the business combination;\n\u00b7\nUpon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the interested stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at least 85% of our voting stock outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, excluding for purposes of determining the voting stock outstanding (but not the outstanding voting stock owned by the\ninterested stockholder) stock held by directors who are also officers of our Company and by employee stock plans that do not provide employees with the right to determine confidentially whether shares held under the plan will be tendered in a tender or exchange offer; or\n\u00b7\nFollowing the transaction in which that person became an interested stockholder, the business combination is approved by our Board and authorized at a meeting of stockholders by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of our outstanding voting stock not owned by the interested stockholder.\ufeff\nThe DGCL generally defines \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d as any person who, together with affiliates and associates, is the owner of 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock or is our affiliate or associate and was the owner of 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock at any time within the three-year period immediately before the date of determination. As a result, our election to be subject to Section 203 of the DGCL could limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us.\nClaims for indemnification by our directors and officers may reduce our available funds to satisfy successful third-party claims against us and may reduce the amount of money available to us.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws provide that we will indemnify our directors and officers, in each case to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. In addition, as permitted by Section 145 of the DGCL, our amended and restated bylaws and our indemnification agreements that we have entered into with our directors and officers provide that:\n\u00b7\nwe will indemnify our directors and officers for serving us in those capacities or for serving other business enterprises at our request, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. Delaware law provides that a corporation may indemnify such person if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the registrant and, with respect to any criminal proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe such person\u2019s conduct was unlawful;\n\u00b7\nwe may, in our discretion, indemnify employees and agents in those circumstances where indemnification is permitted by applicable law;\n\u00b7\nwe are required to advance expenses, as incurred, to our directors and officers in connection with defending a proceeding, except that such directors or officers shall undertake to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification;\n\u00b7\nwe will not be obligated pursuant to our amended and restated bylaws to indemnify a person with respect to proceedings initiated by that person against us or our other indemnitees, except with respect to proceedings authorized by our Board or brought to enforce a right to indemnification;\n\u00b7\nthe rights conferred in our amended and restated bylaws are not exclusive, and we are authorized to enter into indemnification agreements with our directors, officers, employees and agents and to obtain insurance to indemnify such persons; and\n\u00b7\nwe may not retroactively amend our bylaw provisions to reduce our indemnification obligations to directors, officers, employees and agents.\nAs a result, claims for indemnification by our directors and officers may reduce our available funds to satisfy successful third-party claims against us and may reduce the amount of money available to us.", "PERMNO": 15226, "SIC": 4899, "TIC": "ATEX"}
