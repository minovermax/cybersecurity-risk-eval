{"cik": "48465", "company": "HORMEL FOODS CORP /DE/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-12-06", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe Company\u2019s operations are subject to the general risks of the food industry. The food products manufacturing industry is subject to the risks posed by:\n\u25aa\nfood spoilage;\n\u25aa\nfood contamination caused by disease-producing organisms or pathogens, such as Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella, and pathogenic E coli.;\n\u25aa\nfood allergens;\n\u25aa\nnutritional and health-related concerns;\n\u25aa\nfederal, state, and local food processing controls;\n\u25aa\nconsumer product liability claims;\n\u25aa\nproduct tampering; and\n\u25aa\nthe possible unavailability and/or expense of liability insurance.\nThe pathogens that may cause food contamination are found generally in livestock and in the environment and thus may be present in our products. These pathogens can also be introduced to our products as a result of improper handling or cooking by customers or consumers. We do not have control over handling procedures once our products have been shipped for distribution. If one or more of these risks were to materialize, the Company\u2019s brand and business reputation could be negatively impacted. In addition, revenues could decrease, costs of doing business could increase, and the Company\u2019s operating results could be adversely affected.\nDeterioration of economic conditions could harm the Company\u2019s business. The Company's business may be adversely affected by changes in national or global economic conditions, including inflation, interest rates, availability of capital, energy availability and costs (including fuel surcharges), and the effects of governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions. Decreases in consumer spending rates and shifts in consumer product preferences could also negatively impact the Company.\nVolatility in financial markets and the deterioration of national and global economic conditions could impact the Company\u2019s operations as follows:\n\u25aa\nThe financial stability of our customers and suppliers may be compromised, which could result in additional bad debts for the Company or non-performance by suppliers; and\n\u25aa\nThe value of our investments in debt and equity securities may decline, including most significantly the Company\u2019s trading securities held as part of a rabbi trust to fund supplemental executive retirement plans and deferred income plans, and the Company\u2019s assets held in pension plans.\nThe Company utilizes hedging programs to manage its exposure to various commodity market risks, which qualify for hedge accounting for financial reporting purposes. Volatile fluctuations in market conditions could cause these instruments to become ineffective, which could require any gains or losses associated with these instruments to be reported in the Company\u2019s earnings each period. These instruments may limit the Company\u2019s ability to benefit from market gains if commodity prices become more favorable than those secured under the Company\u2019s hedging programs.\nAdditionally, if a highly pathogenic human disease outbreak developed in the United States, it may negatively impact the national economy, demand for Company products, and/or the Company\u2019s workforce availability, and the Company\u2019s financial results could suffer. The Company has developed contingency plans to address infectious disease scenarios and the potential impact on its operations, and will continue to update these plans as necessary. There can be no assurance given, however, these plans will be effective in eliminating the negative effects of any such diseases on the Company\u2019s operating results.\nOutbreaks of disease among livestock and poultry flocks could harm the Company\u2019s revenues and operating margins.\nThe Company is subject to risks associated with the outbreak of disease in pork and beef livestock, and poultry flocks, including African swine fever (ASF), Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), pneumo-virus, Porcine Circovirus 2 (PCV2), Porcine Reproduction & Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS), Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD), Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus (PEDv), and Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI). The outbreak of such diseases could adversely affect the Company\u2019s supply of raw materials, increase the cost of production, reduce utilization of the Company\u2019s harvest facilities, and reduce operating margins. Additionally, the outbreak of disease may hinder the Company\u2019s ability to market and sell products both domestically and internationally.\nMost recently, the outbreak of ASF in China has eliminated over 30 percent of that country's hog herd compared to last year, according to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of the People's Republic of China. The disease has also spread to additional countries in Asia and Europe. If an outbreak of ASF were to occur in the United States, the Company's supply of hogs and pork could be materially impacted.\nThe Company has developed business continuity plans for various disease scenarios and will continue to update these plans as necessary. There can be no assurance given, however, that these plans will be effective in eliminating the negative effects of any such diseases on the Company\u2019s operating results.\nFluctuations in commodity prices and availability of pork, poultry, beef, feed grains, avocados, peanuts, energy, and whey could harm the Company\u2019s earnings. The Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition are largely dependent upon the cost and supply of pork, poultry, beef, feed grains, avocados, peanuts, and whey as well as energy costs and the selling prices for many of our products, which are determined by constantly changing market forces of supply and demand.\nThe live hog industry has evolved to large, vertically-integrated operations using long-term supply agreements. This has resulted in fewer hogs being available on the cash spot market. Consequently, the Company uses long-term supply contracts based on market-based formulas or the cost of production to ensure a stable supply of raw materials while minimizing extreme fluctuations in costs over the long-term. This may result, in the short-term, in higher live hog costs compared to the cash spot market depending on the relationship of the cash spot market to contract prices. Market-based pricing on certain product lines, and lead time required to implement pricing adjustments, may prevent all or part of these cost increases from being recovered, and these higher costs could adversely affect our short-term financial results.\nJennie-O Turkey Store raises turkeys and contracts with turkey growers to meet its raw material requirements for whole birds and processed turkey products. Results in these operations are affected by the cost and supply of feed grains, which fluctuate due to climate conditions, production forecasts, and supply and demand conditions at local, regional, national, and worldwide markets. The Company attempts to manage some of its short-term exposure to fluctuations in feed prices by forward buying, using futures contracts, and pursuing pricing advances. However, these strategies may not be adequate to overcome sustained increases in market prices due to alternate uses for feed grains or other changes in these market conditions.\nThe supplies of natural and organic proteins may impact the Company\u2019s ability to ensure a continuing supply of these products. To mitigate this risk, the Company partners with multiple long-term suppliers.\nInternational trade barriers and other restrictions could result in decreased foreign demand and increased domestic supply of proteins, thereby potentially lowering prices. The Company occasionally utilizes in-country production to limit this exposure.\nMarket demand for the Company\u2019s products may fluctuate. The Company faces competition from producers of alternative meats and protein sources, including pork, beef, turkey, chicken, fish, nut butters, whey, and plant-based proteins. The factors on which the Company competes include:\n\u25aa\nprice;\n\u25aa\nproduct quality and attributes;\n\u25aa\nbrand identification;\n\u25aa\nbreadth of product line; and\n\u25aa\ncustomer service.\nDemand for the Company\u2019s products is also affected by competitors\u2019 promotional spending, the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s advertising and marketing programs, and consumer perceptions. Failure to identify and react to changes in food trends such as sustainability of product sources and animal welfare could lead to, among other things, reduced demand for the Company\u2019s brands and products. The Company may be unable to compete successfully on any or all of these factors in the future.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are subject to the general risks associated with acquisitions and divestitures. The Company has made several acquisitions and divestitures in recent years that align with the Company\u2019s strategic initiative of delivering long-term value to shareholders. The Company regularly reviews strategic opportunities to grow through acquisitions and to divest non-strategic assets. Potential risks associated with these transactions include the the inability to consummate a transaction on favorable terms, the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns, the potential loss of key employees and customers of current or acquired companies, the inability to integrate or divest operations successfully, the possible assumption of unknown liabilities, potential disputes with buyers or sellers, potential impairment charges if purchase assumptions are not achieved, and the inherent risks in entering markets or lines of business in which the Company has limited or no prior experience. Any or all of these risks could impact the Company\u2019s financial results and business reputation. In addition, acquisitions outside the United States may present unique challenges and increase the Company's exposure to the risks associated with foreign operations.\nThe Company is subject to disruption of operations at co-packers or other suppliers. Disruption of operations at co-packers or other suppliers may impact the Company\u2019s product or raw material supply, which could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial results. Additionally, actions taken to mitigate the impact of any potential disruption, including increasing inventory in anticipation of a potential production or supply interruption, may adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial results.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are subject to the general risks of litigation. The Company is involved on an ongoing basis in litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. Trends in litigation may include class actions involving employees, consumers, competitors, suppliers, shareholders, or injured persons, and claims relating to product liability, contract disputes, intellectual property, advertising, labeling, wage and hour laws, employment practices, or environmental matters. Litigation trends and the outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty and adverse litigation trends and outcomes could negatively affect the Company\u2019s financial results.\nThe Company is subject to the loss of a material contract. The Company is a party to several supply, distribution, contract packaging, and other material contracts. The loss of a material contract could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial results.\nGovernment regulation, present and future, exposes the Company to potential sanctions and compliance costs that could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business. The Company\u2019s operations are subject to extensive regulation by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, federal and state taxing authorities, and other federal, state, and local authorities who oversee workforce immigration laws, tax regulations, animal welfare, food safety standards, and the processing, packaging, storage, distribution, advertising, and labeling of the Company\u2019s products. The Company\u2019s manufacturing facilities and products are subject to continuous inspection by federal, state, and local authorities. Claims or enforcement proceedings could be brought against the Company in the future. The availability of government inspectors due to a government furlough could also cause disruption to the Company\u2019s manufacturing facilities. Additionally, the Company is subject to new or modified laws, regulations, and accounting standards. The Company\u2019s failure or inability to comply with such requirements could subject the Company to civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, recalls, or seizures, as well as potential criminal sanctions.\nThe Company is subject to stringent environmental regulation and potentially subject to environmental litigation, proceedings, and investigations. The Company\u2019s past and present business operations and ownership and operation of real property are subject to stringent federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations pertaining to the discharge of materials into the environment and the handling and disposition of wastes (including solid and hazardous wastes) or otherwise relating to protection of the environment. Compliance with these laws and regulations, as well as any modifications, is material to the Company\u2019s business. Some of the Company\u2019s facilities have been in operation for many years and, over time, the Company and other prior operators of these facilities may have generated and disposed of wastes that now may be considered hazardous. Future discovery of contamination of property underlying or in the vicinity of the Company\u2019s present or former properties or manufacturing facilities and/or waste disposal sites could require the Company to incur additional expenses related to additional investigation, assessment or other requirements. The occurrence of any of these events, the implementation of new laws and regulations, or stricter interpretation of existing laws or regulations could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial results.\nThe Company\u2019s foreign operations pose additional risks to the Company\u2019s business. The Company operates its business and markets its products internationally. The Company\u2019s foreign operations are subject to the risks described above, as well as risks related to fluctuations in currency values, foreign currency exchange controls, compliance with foreign laws, compliance with applicable U.S. laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and other economic or political uncertainties. International sales are subject to risks related to general economic conditions, imposition of tariffs, quotas, trade barriers and other restrictions, enforcement of remedies in foreign jurisdictions and compliance with applicable foreign laws, and other economic and political uncertainties. All of these risks could result in increased costs or decreased revenues, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial results.\nThe Company may be adversely impacted if the Company is unable to protect information technology systems against, or effectively respond to, cyber-attacks or security breaches. Information technology systems are an important part of the Company\u2019s business operations. Attempted cyber-attack and other cyber incidents are occurring more frequently and are being made by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives and expertise.\nIn addition, the Company is in the middle of a transformation project (Project Orion) to achieve better analytics, customer service, and process efficiencies through the use of Oracle Cloud Solutions. This project is expected to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of certain financial and business transaction processes and the underlying systems environment. Implementation is expected to occur in phases over the next several years, beginning in fiscal 2020. Such an implementation is a major undertaking from a financial, management, and personnel perspective. The implementation of the enterprise resource planning system may prove to be more difficult, costly, or time consuming than expected, and there can be no assurance that this system will be beneficial to the extent anticipated.\nIn an attempt to mitigate these risks, the Company has implemented and continues to evaluate security initiatives and business continuity plans.\nDeterioration of labor relations or increases in labor costs could harm the Company\u2019s Business. As of October 27, 2019, the Company had approximately 18,800 employees worldwide, of which approximately 3,310 were represented by labor unions, principally the United Food and Commercial Workers Union. A significant increase in labor costs or a deterioration of labor relations at any of the Company\u2019s facilities or contracted hog processing facilities resulting in work slowdowns or stoppages could harm the Company\u2019s financial results. The union contract at one of the Company's facilities will expire during fiscal 2020, covering less than 200 employees. Negotiations are expected to begin in December 2019.", "PERMNO": 32870, "SIC": 2011, "TIC": "HRL"}
