{"cik": "1301501", "company": "Achaogen, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-04-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Capital Requirements\nWe need substantial additional funding to fund our operations, and we cannot continue as a going concern if we are unable to obtain additional funding. Without substantial additional funding, we could be forced to delay, reduce or terminate the commercialization of ZEMDRI, our efforts to obtain regulatory approval for plazomicin from the European Medicines Agency (\u201cEMA\u201d), the development of C-Scape and other operations, payment of obligations in the normal course and we could be forced to default under our loan and security agreement dated February 26, 2018 (the \u201cSVB Loan Agreement\u201d) with Silicon Valley Bank (\u201cSVB\u201d) or seek protection under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.\nDeveloping and commercializing biopharmaceutical products, including launching new products into the marketplace and conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials, is an expensive and highly uncertain process that takes years to complete. We expect to incur substantial expenses as we continue to advance our commercialization efforts for our sole approved product, ZEMDRI, seek regulatory approval for plazomicin outside the United States and continue the development of C-Scape. The commercialization of ZEMDRI has involved and will continue to involve the incurrence of significant sales, marketing, manufacturing and supply expenses. We have had difficulty raising sufficient funds to advance our commercialization of ZEMDRI in the way we intended and our revenues from sales of ZEMDRI to date have been very limited. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized $0.8 million in net product revenues from sales of ZEMDRI.\nOn February 28, 2019, we commenced a restructuring of our organization to conserve our cash resources. The majority of the roles eliminated in the restructuring are field-based sales and medical scientist positions.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had negative working capital of $17.2 million and unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $31.0 million. Based on our available cash resources, which excludes restricted cash (including the $25.0 million of restricted cash collateralized in connection with the SVB Loan Agreement), and we believe we have sufficient cash resources to support current planned operations into June 2019. This condition results in the assessment that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nThere can be no assurance that we will obtain additional debt or equity financing or generate product revenue or revenues from collaborative partners, on terms acceptable to us, on a timely basis or at all. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity, the issuance of additional shares will result in dilution to our current stockholders. If additional financing is accomplished by the issuance of additional debt, the service cost, or interest will reduce net income or increase net loss, and we may also be required to issue shares of common stock or warrants to purchase shares of common stock in connection with issuing such debt. If we are unable to raise additional funding, a further reduction in the scope of our operations may become necessary and we may need to file for protection under the U.S. Bankruptcy code. Our ability to obtain debt financing may be limited by covenants we have made under the SVB Loan Agreement (such as our covenant not to incur indebtedness other than certain specified and limited forms of indebtedness) and our pledge to SVB of substantially all of our assets, other than our intellectual property, as collateral. The negative pledge in favor of SVB with respect to our intellectual property under the SVB Loan Agreement could further limit our ability to obtain additional debt financing. Our failure to raise capital as and when needed would adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition and may cause us to seek protection under the U.S. Bankruptcy code. The amount and timing of our future financing requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe size and timing of revenues from ZEMDRI;\n\u2022\nthe size, timing and type of the nonclinical and clinical studies, including post-marketing commitments, that we decide to pursue in the development of ZEMDRI and C-Scape;\n\u2022\nour ability to identify and consummate a strategic transaction for the Company and the timing and nature of any strategic transactions that we undertake (if any);\n\u2022\nthe timing of, and costs involved in, seeking and obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals for C-Scape and other product candidates, and for seeking and obtaining regulatory approvals outside the United States for plazomicin;\n\u2022\nour ability to enter into additional collaboration, licensing or other arrangements and the terms and timing of such arrangements;\n\u2022\nthe costs of preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining and enforcing any patent applications or claims and other intellectual property rights, including litigation costs and the results of such litigation;\n\u2022\nthe emergence of competing technologies and other adverse market developments;\n\u2022\nthe resources we devote to marketing and commercializing ZEMDRI;\n\u2022\nthe resources we devote to marketing, and, if approved, commercializing our product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe scope, progress, expansion, and costs of manufacturing our product or product candidates;\n\u2022\nour ability to enter into additional government contracts, or other collaborative agreements, to support the development of our product candidates and development efforts, including potential collaborative arrangements relating to the commercialization of ZEMDRI outside the United States, if approved; and\n\u2022\nthe costs associated with being a public company.\nFuture capital requirements will also depend on the extent to which we acquire or invest in additional businesses, products and technologies. We currently have no commitments or agreements relating to any of these types of transactions.\nIf we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, we may be required to delay, reduce or terminate the commercialization of ZEMDRI, our efforts to obtain regulatory approval for plazomicin from the EMA, the development of C-Scape and other operations and could be forced to default under the SVB Loan Agreement or file for relief under the provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. We may also be required to sell or license to others technologies or clinical product candidates or programs that we would prefer to develop and commercialize ourselves or on terms that are less favorable that we might otherwise obtain.\nOur recurring losses from operations and negative cash flows and our difficulty in raising additional capital have raised substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe may not be able to continue as a going concern for multiple reasons, many of which are not in our control. Our recurring losses from operations and negative cash flows raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Based on our available cash resources, which excludes restricted cash (including the $25.0 million of restricted cash collateralized in connection with the SVB Loan Agreement), we believe we have sufficient cash to support current planned operations into June 2019. Accordingly, our ability to continue as a going concern will require us to obtain substantial additional financing to fund our operations or significantly curtail our operations to conserve our capital resources. Further, the perception of our ability to continue as a going concern may make it more difficult for us to obtain financing for the continuation of our operations, or necessitate that we obtain financing on terms that are more favorable to investors, and could result in the loss of confidence by investors, suppliers and employees.\nOur activities to evaluate and pursue strategic alternatives may not be successful.\nOn November 5, 2018, we announced the beginning of a review of strategic alternatives to maximize stockholder value, including but not limited to the potential sale or merger of us or our assets. We have devoted significant time and resources to identifying and evaluating potential strategic alternatives, and the strategic review process continues alongside our continued focus on other corporate initiatives. We may be unable to identify strategic alternatives to maximize stockholder value, and even if we enter into a binding agreement, there is no guarantee that the transactions will be consummated due to regulatory or other obstacles, and even if executed and consummated, such strategic alternatives may not enhance stockholder value or our financial position.\nAny such strategic transaction may require us to incur non-recurring or other charges, may increase our near-and long-term expenditures and may pose significant integration challenges or disrupt our management or business, which could adversely affect our operations and financial results. For example, these transactions may entail numerous operational and financial risks, including:\n\u2022\nexposure to unknown liabilities;\n\u2022\nincurrence of dilutive issuances of equity securities;\n\u2022\nhigher-than-expected acquisition and integration costs;\n\u2022\nwrite-downs of assets or goodwill or impairment charges;\n\u2022\nincreased amortization expenses;\n\u2022\ndifficulty and cost in combining the operations and personnel of any merged businesses with our operations and personnel;\n\u2022\nimpairment of relationships with key suppliers or customers of any merged businesses due to changes in management and ownership; and\n\u2022\ninability to retain our key employees.\nAccordingly, although there can be no assurance that we will undertake or successfully complete any strategic transactions of the nature described above, any transactions that we do complete may be subject to the foregoing or other risks, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and prospects. In addition, any such strategic transaction may result in substantial dilution to existing stockholders and may not result in consideration to the Company or its stockholders in an amount that enhances stockholder value. If we are unable to complete a strategic transaction of the nature described above, we could experience a reduction in stock price and we may be unable to obtain additional financing, which could result in a slowdown of our operations, further reductions in force, or other restructuring or bankruptcy protection efforts.\nIf we file to reorganize under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, our future operations are uncertain and the reorganization could result in a substantial decrease in the value of our common stock, or no value at all.\nWe have had limited capital resources in the past year and have explored whether filing for bankruptcy protection is in the best interest of the Company and its stakeholders. If we file a voluntary petition for relief under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, such a filing could lead to significant adverse effects on the Company\u2019s liquidity, results of operations, business prospects, or abilities to operate. We cannot assure that the outcome of a bankruptcy proceeding would be favorable to us or our stockholders. Risks associated with such a filing could include the following:\n\u2022\nthe inability to maintain sufficient liquidity throughout a filing;\n\u2022\nincreased costs and expenses related to a bankruptcy filing;\n\u2022\nthe ability to manage contracts that are critical for operations, and to obtain and maintain appropriate terms with customers, suppliers and service providers;\n\u2022\nthe ability to develop, confirm and consummate a plan of reorganization;\n\u2022\nthe ability of third parties to seek and obtain court approval to terminate or shorten the exclusivity period for us to propose and confirm a plan of reorganization, to appoint a trustee, or to convert a proceeding under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code to a proceeding under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code;\n\u2022\nthe ability of the Company to continue as a going concern; and\n\u2022\nthe ability of the Company to obtain bankruptcy court approval with respect to motions and legal proceedings in general.\nThese risks and uncertainties could affect our business and operations in various ways. For example, negative events associated with bankruptcy proceedings could adversely affect our relationships with our suppliers, customers, employees, and other third parties, which in turn could adversely affect our operations and financial condition. Also, we would need the prior approval of the bankruptcy court for transactions outside the ordinary course of business, which would then limit our ability to respond timely to certain events or take advantage of certain opportunities. Additionally, if we do not raise additional capital before the end of the second quarter of 2019, we believe we likely will need to file to sell our assets or reorganize under the United States Bankruptcy Code, rendering our future operations uncertain and filing for bankruptcy protection could result in a substantial decrease in the value of our common stock, or no value at all.\nIf we default under the SVB Loan Agreement, we could be required to repay the outstanding indebtedness and SVB could exercise its rights to take possession of our cash and substantially all of our property as collateral. SVB could also encourage us or seek to require us to file for bankruptcy protection.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had $49.8 million of indebtedness outstanding under the SVB Loan Agreement, and no borrowings remain available under the SVB Loan Agreement. In December 2018, SVB collateralized $25.0 million of the borrowed funds meaning that these funds are restricted and no longer available for our use until our cash on deposit at SVB exceeds the \u2018Minimum Account Threshold\u2019 for thirty consecutive days, which is the greater of (a) $48.0 million and (b) the \u2018Monthly Cash Burn\u2019 which as defined as the difference of (1)(i) net loss plus (ii) unfinanced capital expenditures minus (2)(i) depreciation and amortization expenses, (ii) non-cash stock compensation expense and (iii) other non-cash expenses as approved by SVB.\nAn event of default will occur under the SVB Loan Agreement if, among other things, we fail to make payments, we breach any of our covenants, subject to specified cure periods with respect to certain breaches, we or our assets become subject to certain legal proceedings, such as bankruptcy proceedings, we are unable to pay our debts as they become due, we default on contracts with third parties which would permit the holder of indebtedness to accelerate the maturity of such indebtedness or that could have a material adverse change on us or SVB determines that a \u2018material adverse change\u2019 has occurred. The SVB Loan Agreement defines a \u2018material adverse change\u2019 as a material (a) impairment in the perfection or priority of SVB\u2019s lien in its collateral or the value of its collateral, (b) adverse change in our business, operations, or condition (financial or otherwise) or (c) impairment of the prospect of our repayment to SVB of any portion of our obligations under the SVB Loan Agreement.\nUpon the occurrence and for the duration of an event of default, including a determination by SVB that a \u2018material adverse change\u2019 has occurred, an additional default interest rate equal to 4.0% per annum will apply to all obligations owed under the SVB Loan Agreement. In addition, we may be required to repay the outstanding indebtedness if an event of default occurs under the SVB Loan Agreement. We may not have enough available cash or be able to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings to repay such indebtedness at the time any such event of default occurs. In this case, we may be required to delay, reduce or terminate the commercialization of ZEMDRI, our efforts to obtain regulatory approval for plazomicin from the EMA, the development of C-Scape and other operations and could be forced to file for relief under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. SVB could also exercise its rights as collateral agent to take possession of and to dispose of the collateral securing the term loans, which collateral includes our cash held in our bank accounts with SVB and substantially all of our property (excluding intellectual property, which is subject to a negative pledge). Our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected as a result of any of these events.\nOur operating activities are restricted as a result of covenants in the SVB Loan Agreement.\nThe SVB Loan Agreement subjects us to various customary affirmative and negative covenants, including, among others, requirements as to financial reporting and insurance and restrictions on our ability to dispose of our business or property, to change our line of business, to liquidate or dissolve, to enter into any change in control transaction, to merge or consolidate with any other entity or to acquire all or substantially all the capital stock or property of another entity, to incur additional indebtedness, to incur liens on our property, to pay any dividends or other distributions on capital stock other than dividends payable solely in capital stock, to redeem capital stock, to\nenter into licensing agreements, to engage in transactions with affiliates, and to encumber our intellectual property. Our business may be adversely affected by these restrictions on our ability to operate our business.\nWe have a limited operating history, have incurred net losses in each year since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future, and if we are unable to reduce our losses and achieve profitability, the market value of our common stock will likely decline.\nWe are a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company with a limited operating history. We generated revenue from the sale of products for the first time in the third quarter of 2018 and have incurred losses in each year since we commenced operations in 2004. Our sole product approved for sale, ZEMDRI, has only recently been commercialized. In the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we derived all of our revenue from sales of ZEMDRI and from non-profit foundation and government contracts for research and development. We may seek continued revenue from non-profit foundations and government contracts for research and development and additional sources of public health funding. Revenues from such contracts and other sources can be uncertain because milestones or other contingent payments under them may not be achieved or received. In addition, we may not be able to enter into other contracts that will generate significant cash. Our net losses for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were $186.5 million and $125.6 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, we had an accumulated deficit of $559.4 million.\nWe expect to continue incurring significant expenses and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future as we continue to advance our commercialization efforts for our sole approved product, ZEMDRI, seek marketing approvals for plazomicin from the EMA, build commercial supply and conduct commercialization activities for ZEMDRI in the United States, and continue the development of C-Scape. Our expenses will also increase substantially if and as we:\n\u2022\nconduct additional clinical trials for our product or product candidates;\n\u2022\nestablish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize ZEMDRI and any product candidates for which we may obtain marketing approval;\n\u2022\nestablish a manufacturing and supply chain sufficient for commercial quantities of ZEMDRI and any product candidates for which we may obtain marketing approval;\n\u2022\nmaintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;\n\u2022\nhire additional clinical, scientific and commercial personnel;\n\u2022\nadd operational, financial and management information systems and personnel; and\n\u2022\nacquire or in-license other products, product candidates and technologies.\nIf the commercialization of ZEMDRI is unsuccessful, or if our product candidates fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy in clinical trials, do not gain regulatory approval, or do not achieve market acceptance following regulatory approval and commercialization, we may never become profitable. Even if we achieve profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods. Our prior losses, combined with expected future losses, have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders\u2019 equity and working capital. If we are unable to achieve and sustain profitability, the market value of our common stock will likely decline. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing biopharmaceutical products, we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses or when, if ever, we will become profitable.\nWe are substantially dependent on the success of our sole approved product, ZEMDRI. If we are unable to successfully commercialize ZEMDRI, or experience significant delays in doing so, our business would be materially harmed.\nWe currently have one product approved for sale, ZEMDRI, and since 2007, we have invested a significant portion of our efforts and financial resources in the development of ZEMDRI. Our future success is substantially dependent on our ability to successfully commercialize ZEMDRI, which was first made available for ordering on\nJuly 20, 2018. Our ability to successfully commercialize ZEMDRI will depend on several factors, including the following:\n\u2022\nacceptance of ZEMDRI by patients, the medical community and third-party payors;\n\u2022\nestablishing market share while competing with other therapies;\n\u2022\nsuccessfully executing our pricing and reimbursement strategy;\n\u2022\nmaintaining commercial manufacturing and supply arrangements;\n\u2022\nmaintaining a commercial infrastructure;\n\u2022\nreceipt of marketing approvals for ZEMDRI from regulatory authorities outside the United States;\n\u2022\nthe commercial impact of the prescribing information for ZEMDRI, including the boxed warning;\n\u2022\nidentifying and successfully establishing one or more collaborations to commercialize ZEMDRI outside the United States;\n\u2022\na continued acceptable safety and adverse event profile of ZEMDRI; and\n\u2022\nqualifying for, identifying, registering, maintaining, enforcing and defending intellectual property rights and claims covering ZEMDRI.\nIn addition, we are seeking, but have not yet received, FDA approval for, an indication for ZEMDRI to treat bloodstream infections (\u201cBSI\u201d). In December 2018, we filed a Formal Dispute Resolution Request with the FDA regarding the indication for plazomicin for the treatment of BSI for which the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter in June 2018. The failure to obtain approval for the BSI indication for ZEMDRI may adversely impact the commercial uptake of ZEMDRI by healthcare professionals. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized $0.8 million in net product revenue from sales of ZEMDRI.\nClinical drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process with uncertain outcomes that may lead to delayed timelines and increased cost, and may prevent us from being able to complete clinical trials.\nClinical testing is expensive, can take many years to complete, and its outcome and timeline are inherently uncertain. The results of preclinical and clinical studies of our product candidates may not be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical trials. Product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy despite having progressed through preclinical studies and initial clinical trials. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or adverse safety profiles, notwithstanding promising results in earlier studies, and we cannot be certain that we will not face similar setbacks.\nWe cannot be certain that our future clinical trials for ZEMDRI (if any), C-Scape, or other product candidates, will progress as expected, not need to be redesigned, enroll an adequate number of patients on time or be completed on schedule, if at all, or support continued clinical development of the associated product candidate.\nClinical trials can be delayed, aborted or fail for a variety of reasons, including an inability:\n\u2022\nto obtain regulatory approval to commence a trial in the countries where the trial is to be conducted;\n\u2022\nto successfully initiate a clinical trial, enroll patients, and complete clinical trial activities in foreign countries;\n\u2022\nto recruit and enroll suitable patients to participate in a trial;\n\u2022\nto reach agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations (\u201cCROs\u201d) or clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;\n\u2022\nto obtain institutional review board (\u201cIRB\u201d) approval at each site;\n\u2022\nto have patients complete a trial or return for post-treatment follow-up;\n\u2022\nto obtain a sufficient number of clinical sites to participate in a trial and adhere to trial protocols;\n\u2022\nto address any patient safety concerns that arise during the course of a trial;\n\u2022\nto address any conflicts with new or existing laws or regulations;\n\u2022\nto manufacture sufficient quantities of product supply for use in clinical trials; or\n\u2022\nto ensure clinical trial sites comply with Good Clinical Practice (\u201cGCP\u201d) guidelines.\nEnrollment delays in our clinical trials may result in increased development costs for our product candidates, slow down or halt our product development and approval processes, and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenue, which would cause the value of our company to decline and limit our ability to obtain additional financing if needed. Patient enrollment in clinical trials is a function of many factors, including: the nature of clinical trial protocols, existence of competing protocols or treatments (if any), the size and longevity of the target patient population, proximity of patients to clinical sites and eligibility criteria for the clinical trials. Although we will continue to look for opportunities for faster regulatory approvals, we cannot guarantee that additional opportunities will arise, that the FDA or other regulatory authorities will agree with any additional proposals we make or that such additional proposals, even if approved, will be successful.\nWe could also encounter delays if a clinical trial is suspended or terminated by us upon recommendation of the data monitoring committee for such trial, by the IRBs of the institutions in which such trials are being conducted, or by the FDA or other regulatory authorities. Such authorities may suspend or terminate a clinical trial due to a number of factors, including failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols, inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial site by the FDA or other regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold, unforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects, failure to demonstrate a benefit from using a drug, changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions, or lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial.\nIf we experience delays in the completion of, or termination of, any clinical trial of our product candidates, the commercial prospects of our product candidates may be harmed, and our ability to generate revenue from the sale of any of these product candidates will be delayed. In addition, any delays in completing our clinical trials will increase our costs, slow down our product candidate development and approval processes, and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenue. Any of these occurrences may significantly harm our business, financial condition and prospects.\nFailure to ensure that a plazomicin IVD assay or related diagnostic is generally available could harm our commercialization strategy for ZEMDRI.\nAn important element of our commercialization strategy for ZEMDRI is the availability of IVD assays or related diagnostics to support the Therapeutic Drug Management (\u201cTDM\u201d) of certain patients dosed with ZEMDRI. The plazomicin IVD assay is intended to measure levels of plazomicin in the blood so such patients can receive safe and efficacious doses of ZEMDRI. There are currently two assays for plazomicin that are commercially available. Even once assays are commercially available, there are regulatory bases for them to be withdrawn or limited in use.\nShould an IVD assay or related diagnostic not be available generally, it could impact our ability to successfully commercialize ZEMDRI for the treatment of certain patients. Moreover, IVD assays may not be readily available or economically feasible in all territories where ZEMDRI could ultimately be commercialized. Failure to have an IVD assay generally available for ZEMDRI could impact our ability to optimize commercialization of ZEMDRI.\nIf the FDA does not conclude that our product candidate, C-Scape, satisfies the requirements for the 505(b)(2) regulatory approval pathway, or if the requirements for approval under Section 505(b)(2) are not as we expect,\nthe approval pathway for C-Scape will likely take significantly longer, cost significantly more and encounter significantly greater complications and risks than anticipated, and in any case may not be successful.\nWe may pursue clinical trials and, if successful, seek FDA approval through the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway for our product candidate, C-Scape, which is a combination of two previously FDA-approved drugs. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, also known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, added Section 505(b)(2) to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, (the \u201cFDCA\u201d). Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies that were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. If the FDA does not allow us to pursue the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway for C-Scape as anticipated, we may need to conduct additional clinical trials beyond our current expectations, provide additional data and information and meet additional standards for regulatory approval. If this were to occur, the time and financial resources required to obtain FDA approval for C-Scape would likely substantially increase. Moreover, the inability to pursue the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway could result in new competitive products reaching the market faster than C-Scape, which could materially adversely impact our competitive position and prospects. Even if we are allowed to pursue the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway for C-Scape, we cannot assure you that we will receive the requisite or timely approvals for commercialization of such product candidate. In addition, it is possible competitors or others will file citizens\u2019 petitions with the FDA in an attempt to persuade the FDA that C-Scape, or the clinical studies that support their approval, contain deficiencies. Such actions by our competitors or others could delay or even prevent the FDA from approving any NDA that we submit under Section 505(b)(2).\nIf we fail to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of product candidates that we develop to the satisfaction of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, we may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of such product candidates. This would adversely impact our ability to generate revenue, our business and our results of operations.\nWe are not permitted to commercialize, market, promote, or sell any product candidate in the United States without obtaining marketing approval from the FDA or in other countries without obtaining approvals from comparable foreign regulatory authorities, such as the EMA. To gain approval to market a product candidate, we must complete extensive preclinical development and clinical trials that demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the product for the intended indication to the satisfaction of the FDA or other regulatory authority.\nIn June 2018, we obtained approval from the FDA for the treatment of cUTI, including pyelonephritis, with ZEMDRI. We submitted a Marketing Authorization Application to the EMA in October of 2018. We cannot be certain that ZEMDRI will receive regulatory approval from the EMA and any other foreign regulatory authorities in a timely manner, or at all. Even if we successfully obtain regulatory approval to market ZEMDRI outside the United States, our revenue from this approval will be dependent, in part, upon our or a commercial partner\u2019s ability to obtain regulatory clearance or approval of an IVD assay or related diagnostic to be used with ZEMDRI outside the United States, as well as upon the size of the markets in the territories for which we gain regulatory approval and have commercial rights. Moreover, we cannot be certain that any product candidates other than ZEMDRI, such as C-Scape, will receive regulatory approval from the FDA, EMA and other foreign regulatory authorities in a timely manner, or at all.\nThe FDA, EMA or any other foreign regulatory authorities can delay, limit, or deny approval of our product candidates for many reasons, including:\n\u2022\nour inability to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory agency that the product candidate is safe and effective for the requested indication;\n\u2022\nthe FDA\u2019s or the applicable foreign regulatory agency\u2019s disagreement with the interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u2022\nour inability to demonstrate that the clinical and other benefits of the product candidate outweigh any safety or other perceived risks;\n\u2022\nthe FDA\u2019s or the applicable foreign regulatory agency\u2019s requirement for additional preclinical or clinical studies;\n\u2022\nthe FDA\u2019s or the applicable foreign regulatory agency\u2019s non-approval of the formulation, labeling or the specifications of the product candidate;\n\u2022\nthe FDA\u2019s or the applicable foreign regulatory agency\u2019s failure to approve the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we contract;\n\u2022\nthe potential for approval policies or regulations of the FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory agencies to significantly change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval; or\n\u2022\nfailure to adequately demonstrate study conduct oversight, ensure data integrity, and that clinical study sites complied with the principles of Good Clinical Practice, such that we do not pass pre-approval inspections by the FDA or other foreign regulatory agencies.\nEven if we receive approval of an NDA or foreign regulatory filing for product candidates, the FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory agency may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly additional clinical trials which may be required after approval. The FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory agency also may approve ZEMDRI for a more limited indication or a narrower patient population than we originally requested, and the FDA, or applicable foreign regulatory agency, may not approve the labeling that we believe is necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of the product candidate. Any delay in obtaining, or inability to obtain, applicable regulatory approval would delay or prevent commercialization of the product candidates and would materially adversely impact our business and prospects.\nZEMDRI may cause undesirable side effects. Serious adverse events or other unexpected properties of ZEMDRI and our product candidates may be identified during development or after approval that could delay, prevent or cause the withdrawal of regulatory approval, limit the commercial potential, or result in significant negative consequences following marketing approval.\nZEMDRI includes a boxed warning about its use. Serious adverse events or undesirable side effects caused by, or other unexpected properties of, our product and product candidates could result in a more restrictive label, the imposition of distribution or use restrictions or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. If ZEMDRI or any of our product candidates are associated with serious adverse events or undesirable side effects or have properties that are unexpected, we may need to abandon their sale or development or limit sales or development to certain uses or subpopulations in which the undesirable side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent, less severe or more acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective. Many compounds that initially showed promise in clinical or earlier stage testing have later been found to cause undesirable or unexpected side effects that prevented further development of the compound.\nUndesirable side effects or other unexpected adverse events or properties of ZEMDRI or any of our other product candidates could arise or become known either during clinical development or, if approved, after the approved product has been marketed. If such an event occurs during development, our trials could be suspended or terminated and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities could order us to cease further development of, or deny approval of, ZEMDRI or our other product candidates. If such an event occurs after ZEMDRI or such other product candidates are approved, a number of potentially significant negative consequences may result, including:\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may withdraw the approval of such product;\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may require additional warnings on the label or impose distribution or use restrictions;\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may require one or more post-market studies;\n\u2022\nwe may be required to create a medication guide outlining the risks of such side effects for distribution to patients;\n\u2022\nwe could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients;\n\u2022\nhealthcare providers may choose to treat patients with other drugs; and\n\u2022\nour reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product candidate, if approved, or could substantially increase commercialization costs and expenses, which could delay or prevent us from generating revenue from the sale of our products and harm our business and results of operations.\nWe cannot predict to what extent bacteria may develop resistance to ZEMDRI, C-Scape, or other product candidates, or how resistance could spread, which could affect the revenue potential for these products.\nWe developed ZEMDRI and are developing C-Scape and other product candidates to treat multi-drug resistant (\u201cMDR\u201d) infections. The bacteria responsible for these infections evolve quickly and readily transfer their resistance mechanisms within and between species. Furthermore, some resistance to ZEMDRI and C-Scape already exists and we cannot predict how the prevalence of bacterial resistance to ZEMDRI and C-Scape will change over time.\nAs with some other commercially available aminoglycosides, ZEMDRI is not active against organisms expressing a resistance mechanism known as ribosomal methyltransferase. Although occurrence of this resistance mechanism among CRE varies regionally and is currently rare in the United States, there have been isolated cases of infections by bacteria carrying ribosomal methyltransferase in the United States. We cannot predict whether ribosomal methyltransferase will become widespread in regions where we intend to market ZEMDRI if it is approved. The growth of MDR infections in community settings or in countries with poor public health infrastructures, or the potential use of ZEMDRI outside of controlled hospital settings, could contribute to the rise of ZEMDRI resistance. If resistance to ZEMDRI becomes prevalent, our ability to generate revenue from ZEMDRI could suffer. If resistance to C-Scape and other product candidates becomes prevalent, our ability to generate revenue from them, if approved, could similarly suffer.\nWe may become dependent on our partners, including but not limited to Thermo Fisher, to commercialize IVD or related assays.\nWe have entered into a collaboration with Thermo Fisher for the commercialization of a plazomicin IVD assay. We may be dependent on Thermo Fisher with respect to such manufacturing and supply and with respect to commercialization in the United States and EU. This reduces our control over these activities but would not relieve us of our responsibility to ensure compliance with all required legal, regulatory and scientific standards with respect to ZEMDRI.\nWe or Thermo Fisher may encounter difficulties in developing an assay for commercial application in one or more countries, including issues in relation to regulatory approval, automation, selectivity/specificity, analytical validation, reproducibility, or clinical validation of such assay. If Thermo Fisher does not perform its contractual duties or obligations, experiences work stoppages, does not meet expected deadlines, terminates its agreements with us or needs to be replaced, or if they otherwise do not meet our expectations for manufacture or commercialization of the assay, we may need to enter into new arrangements with one or more alternative third parties for development, manufacture or commercialization of the assay or an alternative assay. We may not be able to do so on commercially reasonably terms, or within the terms of the commercialization agreement without amending such terms, or at all, which could adversely impact our business and results of operations related to ZEMDRI.\nEven if a product candidate does obtain regulatory approval it may never achieve market acceptance by physicians, patients, hospitals, third-party payors and others in the medical community necessary for commercial success and the market opportunity may be smaller than we estimate.\nEven though we have obtained FDA approval for ZEMDRI and even if we obtain FDA or other regulatory approvals and are able to launch other product candidates commercially, our products or product candidates may not achieve market acceptance among physicians, patients, hospitals (including pharmacy directors) and third-party payors and, ultimately, may not be commercially successful. Market acceptance and market opportunity of any product candidate for which we receive approval depends on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe efficacy and safety of the product candidate as demonstrated in clinical trials;\n\u2022\nrelative convenience and ease of administration;\n\u2022\nthe clinical indications for which the product candidate is approved;\n\u2022\nthe potential and perceived advantages and disadvantages of the product candidates, including cost and clinical benefit relative to alternative treatments;\n\u2022\nthe willingness of physicians to prescribe the product;\n\u2022\nthe willingness of hospital pharmacy directors to purchase our products for their formularies;\n\u2022\nacceptance by physicians, operators of hospitals and treatment facilities and parties responsible for reimbursement of the product;\n\u2022\nthe availability of adequate coverage and reimbursement by third-party payors and government authorities;\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of sales and marketing efforts, including the effectiveness of the sales and marketing efforts of any collaboration partners, if any;\n\u2022\nthe strength of our marketing and distribution support, including the strength of marketing and distribution support of any collaboration partners, if any;\n\u2022\nlimitations or warnings, including distribution or use restrictions, contained in the product\u2019s approved labeling or an approved risk evaluation and mitigation strategy;\n\u2022\nwhether and how the product is designated under physician treatment guidelines for particular infections;\n\u2022\ncontinued development of MDR infections such as CRE;\n\u2022\nthe approval of other new products for the same indications;\n\u2022\nthe timing of market introduction of the approved product as well as competitive products;\n\u2022\nadverse publicity about the product or favorable publicity about competitive products;\n\u2022\nthe emergence of bacterial resistance to the product candidate; and\n\u2022\nthe rate at which resistance to other drugs in the target infections grow.\nAny failure by ZEMDRI or any product candidate that obtains regulatory approval to achieve market acceptance or commercial success would adversely affect our business prospects.\nThe availability of adequate third-party coverage and reimbursement for approved products is uncertain, and failure to obtain adequate coverage and reimbursement from government and other third-party payors could impede our ability to market any future products we may develop and could limit our ability to generate revenue.\nThere is significant uncertainty related to the third-party payor coverage and reimbursement of newly approved medical products. In addition, there is uncertainty for continued levels of reimbursement for any medical products in consideration of competition, issues concerning the global healthcare infrastructure and other issues that may be beyond our control. The commercial success of ZEMDRI and our future products in both domestic and international markets depends on whether third-party coverage and reimbursement is available and ongoing for such products. Governmental payors, including Medicare and Medicaid, health maintenance organizations and other third-party payors are increasingly attempting to manage their healthcare expenditures by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement of new drugs and biologics and, as a result, they may not cover or provide adequate reimbursement for ZEMDRI, our future products or related diagnostics. These payors may not view ZEMDRI or our future products as cost-effective, and coverage and reimbursement may not be available to our customers or may not be sufficient to allow our future products to be marketed on a competitive basis.\nThird-party payors are exerting increasing influence on decisions regarding the use of, and coverage and reimbursement levels for, particular treatments. Such third-party payors, including Medicare, are challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, and many third-party payors limit or delay coverage and reimbursement for newly approved healthcare products. In particular, third-party payors may limit the covered indications. Cost-control initiatives could cause us to decrease the price we might establish for products, which could result in lower than anticipated revenue from the sale of ZEMDRI or our product candidates. If we decrease the prices for ZEMDRI or our product candidates or are unable to occasionally increase prices because of competitive pressures or if governmental and other third-party payors do not provide adequate coverage or reimbursement, our prospects for revenue and profitability will suffer.\nIn addition, to the extent that ZEMDRI or our product candidates will be used in a hospital inpatient setting, hospitals often receive fixed reimbursement for all of a patient\u2019s care, including the cost of our drug products and IVD assay, based on the patient\u2019s diagnosis. For example, Medicare reimbursement for hospital inpatient stays is generally made under a prospective payment system that is determined by a classification system known as the Medicare severity diagnosis-related groups. Our patients\u2019 access to adequate coverage and reimbursement by government and private insurance plans is central to the acceptance of ZEMDRI and our future products. We may be unable to sell ZEMDRI and our future products on a profitable basis if third-party payors reduce their current levels of payment, or if our costs of production increase faster than increases in reimbursement levels.\nWe developed ZEMDRI for the treatment of serious bacterial infections due to MDR Enterobacteriaceae, which constitutes a growing but relatively small patient population. Antibiotics have historically been marketed towards broad patient populations at relatively low prices. Based on the high unmet medical need in the treatment of these infections and the high costs of treating antibiotic resistant infections, we are targeting value-based pricing for ZEMDRI. If hospitals or governmental or other third-party payors do not view the benefits of ZEMDRI as worth the cost, we will be unable to achieve our pricing and reimbursement objectives and our prospects for revenue and profitability will suffer.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct some of our preclinical studies and all of our clinical trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may be unable to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize any of our product candidates.\nWe rely on medical institutions, clinical investigators, contract laboratories and other third parties, such as CROs, to conduct our preclinical studies and clinical trials on our product candidates in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. These third parties are not our employees and, except for restrictions imposed by our contracts with such third parties, we have limited ability to control the amount or timing of resources that they devote to our programs. These third parties are located around the world and many of them are outside the United States. Although we rely on these third parties to conduct our preclinical studies and clinical trials, we remain responsible for ensuring that each of our preclinical studies and clinical trials is conducted in accordance with its investigational plan and protocol and the applicable legal, regulatory, and scientific standards, and our reliance on these third parties does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities, including with respect to FDA inspections. The FDA and regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions require us to comply with regulations and standards,\ncommonly referred to as current good clinical practices (\u201ccGCPs\u201d), for conducting, monitoring, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials, in order to ensure that the data and results are scientifically credible and accurate and that the trial subjects are adequately informed of the potential risks of participating in clinical trials. If we or any of our third-party contractors fail to comply with applicable cGCPs, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. In addition, we are required to report certain financial interests of our third-party investigators if these relationships exceed certain financial thresholds and meet other criteria. The FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may question the integrity of the data from those clinical trials conducted by principal investigators who previously served or currently serve as scientific advisors or consultants to us from time to time and receive cash compensation in connection with such services. Our clinical trials must also generally be conducted with products produced under current good manufacturing practice (\u201ccGMP\u201d) regulations. Our failure to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process.\nMany of the third parties with whom we contract may also have relationships with other commercial entities, some of which may compete with us. If the third parties conducting our preclinical studies or our clinical trials do not perform their contractual duties or obligations or comply with regulatory requirements we may need to enter into new arrangements with alternative third parties. This could be costly, and our preclinical studies or clinical trials may need to be extended, delayed, terminated or repeated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval in a timely fashion, or at all, for the applicable product candidate, or to commercialize such product candidate being tested in such studies or trials. If any of our relationships with these third parties terminate, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative third-party contractors or to do so on commercially reasonable terms. Though we carefully manage our relationships with our CROs, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter similar challenges or delays in the future or that these delays or challenges will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and prospects.\nWe rely on third-party contract manufacturing organizations to manufacture and supply ZEMDRI and C-Scape, for us, as well as certain raw materials and other ingredients used in the production thereof. If one of our suppliers or manufacturers fails to perform adequately we may be required to incur significant delays and costs to find new suppliers or manufacturers.\nWe currently have limited experience in, and we do not own facilities for, manufacturing our product candidates, including ZEMDRI and C-Scape. We rely upon third-party manufacturing organizations to manufacture and supply our product candidates and certain raw materials and other ingredients used in the production thereof. Some of our key components for the production of ZEMDRI have a limited number of suppliers. In particular, sisomicin, the aminoglycoside precursor for ZEMDRI, is supplied by a single manufacturer in China for which we do not have a commercial supply agreement.\nThe facilities used by our contract manufacturers to manufacture ZEMDRI and our product candidates must be approved by the FDA pursuant to inspections that will be conducted after we submit an NDA to the FDA. We do not control the manufacturing process of, and are completely dependent on, our contract manufacturing partners for compliance with cGMP regulations for manufacture of ZEMDRI and our product candidates. If any of our contract manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA or others, they may not be able to secure and/or maintain regulatory approval for their manufacturing facilities. If any of our contract manufacturers receive warning letters or other notices of violations from the FDA or other regulatory authorities, they may be unable to address the issues raised in such warnings or notices in a timely basis, or at all. This could cause a delay or inability to supply materials or services on a timely basis, or at all. There could also be a delay if we are required to seek additional or backup sources for any aspects of the manufacturing process. In addition, we have no control over the ability of our contract manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel. If the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority does not approve these facilities for the manufacture of our product candidates or if it delays or withdraws any such approval in the future, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which would significantly impact our ability to develop, obtain and maintain regulatory approval for or market our product and product candidates, if approved.\nOur third-party suppliers may not be able to meet our supply needs or timelines and this may negatively affect our business. A majority of the manufacturing process is operated internationally, and therefore may be subject to\nsimilar risks of the sort described by the risk factor entitled \u201cA variety of risks associated with international operations could materially adversely affect our business.\u201d\nThe failure of third-party manufacturers or suppliers to perform adequately or the termination of our arrangements with any of them may adversely affect our business.\nA variety of risks associated with international operations could materially adversely affect our business.\nCertain existing suppliers we use are located outside of the United States, including our sole source supplier for sisomicin, a key raw material for the production of ZEMDRI, which is located in China, and for which we do not have a commercial supply agreement. Additionally, if ZEMDRI is approved for commercialization outside the United States, we will likely seek to enter into agreements with third parties to market ZEMDRI outside the United States. Our product candidates are also likely to rely upon certain suppliers and other third parties outside the United States. We are, or we expect that we will be, subject to additional risks related to these international business relationships, including:\n\u2022\ndifferent regulatory requirements for drug approvals in foreign countries;\n\u2022\ndiffering U.S. and foreign drug import and export costs and rules;\n\u2022\nreduced protection for intellectual property rights in certain foreign countries;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers and regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\ndifferent reimbursement systems;\n\u2022\neconomic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets;\n\u2022\ncompliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad;\n\u2022\nforeign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenue, and other obligations incident to doing business in another country;\n\u2022\npotential liability resulting from development work conducted by these third parties; and\n\u2022\nbusiness interruptions resulting from geopolitical events, including war and terrorism, or natural disasters.\nIf the testing or use of ZEMDRI or our product candidates harms people or is perceived to harm them even when such harm is unrelated to our product or product candidates, we may be subject to costly and damaging product liability claims that may not be fully covered by our insurance.\nBecause we have a commercialized product, ZEMDRI, and because we conduct clinical trials with human patients as part of our business for product and product candidates, we face the risk that the use of our products and product candidates may cause harm or adverse side effects to patients. The FDA-approved label for ZEMDRI contains a boxed warning about its risks related to nephrotoxicity, ototoxicity, neuromuscular blockade and fetal harm. There are additional warnings, precautions and contraindications in our FDA-approved label as well. As only limited clinical safety and efficacy data for ZEMDRI are currently available, ZEMDRI is labeled to be reserved for use in cUTI patients who have limited or no alternative treatment options. Although we have product liability insurance, our insurance may be insufficient to reimburse us for any expenses or losses we may suffer. We do not know whether we will be able to continue to obtain product liability coverage and obtain expanded coverage if we require it, on acceptable terms, if at all. We may not have sufficient resources to pay for any liabilities resulting from a claim excluded from, or beyond the limits of, our insurance coverage. Where we have provided indemnities in favor of third parties under our agreements with them, there is also a risk that these third parties could incur liability and bring a claim under such indemnities. An individual may bring a product liability claim against us alleging that one of our product candidates or products causes, or is claimed to have caused, an injury or is found to be unsuitable for consumer use. Any product liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, could result in:\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of clinical trial volunteers, investigators, patients or trial sites;\n\u2022\nthe inability to commercialize our product candidates;\n\u2022\ndecreased demand for our product candidates;\n\u2022\nregulatory investigations that could require costly recalls or product modifications;\n\u2022\nloss of revenue;\n\u2022\nsubstantial costs of litigation;\n\u2022\nliabilities that substantially exceed our product liability insurance, which we would then be required to pay ourselves;\n\u2022\nan increase in our product liability insurance rates or the inability to maintain insurance coverage in the future on acceptable terms, if at all;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management\u2019s attention from our business; and\n\u2022\ndamage to our reputation and the reputation of our products.\nProduct liability claims may subject us to the foregoing and other risks, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nIf an effective distribution process is not maintained for ZEMDRI and any associated IVD assays, which includes cold-chain logistics, our business may be adversely affected.\nWe do not currently have our own infrastructure necessary for distributing pharmaceutical products to patients. We have contracted with a third-party logistics company to warehouse and distribute ZEMDRI, and we require ZEMDRI to be maintained at a controlled temperature for some of the distribution chain. Similarly, Thermo Fisher and others will be responsible for warehousing and distributing an IVD assay associated with ZEMDRI, which will also require cold-chain logistics. If we or Thermo Fisher are unable to effectively manage the distribution process of ZEMDRI or an associated IVD assay, sales of ZEMDRI and an associated IVD assay may be severely compromised and our results of operations may be harmed.\nIn addition, the use of third-party distributors, including with respect to cold-chain logistics for ZEMDRI and an associated IVD assay, involves certain risks, including, but not limited to, risks that distributors or pharmacies will:\n\u2022\nnot provide us with accurate or timely information regarding their inventories, the number of patients who are using ZEMDRI or the IVD assay, or complaints regarding them;\n\u2022\nnot effectively sell or support ZEMDRI or an associated IVD assay with sufficient cold storage;\n\u2022\nreduce their efforts or discontinue to sell or support ZEMDRI or the IVD assay;\n\u2022\nnot devote the resources necessary to sell ZEMDRI or the IVD assay in the volumes and within the time frames that we expect;\n\u2022\nfail to comply with applicable laws and regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nbe unable to satisfy financial obligations to us or others; or\n\u2022\ncease operations.\nCurrently cold-chain logistics are required for ZEMDRI. If we do not effectively maintain our cold-chain supply logistics, then we may experience an unusual number of product returns or out of date product. Any such failure may result in decreased product sales and lower product revenue, which would harm our business. If cold chain logistics are required for IVD assays associated with ZEMDRI, failure to maintain such logistics may also result in decreased sales and lower product revenues of ZEMDRI.\nIf we are unable to develop an adequate sales and marketing and distribution capability on our own or through third parties for commercializing ZEMDRI and our candidates outside the United States, we will not be successful in commercializing ZEMDRI and our future products outside the United States.\nWe currently seek to collaborate with companies that can provide a commercial presence and experience in targeted geographic markets outside of the United States for the commercialization of ZEMDRI, if approved. If we rely on third parties for selling, marketing and distributing our approved products outside the United States, any revenue we receive outside the United States will depend upon the efforts of third parties, which may not be successful and are only partially within our control, and our product revenue may be lower than if we directly sold or marketed our products. If we are unable to enter into arrangements with third parties to sell, market and distribute products for which we have received regulatory approval outside the United States on acceptable terms or at all, we will need to market these products ourselves. This is likely to be expensive and logistically difficult, as it would require us to build our own sales, marketing and distribution capacity outside the United States. We have no historical operations in this area, and if such efforts were necessary, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our future products. If we are not successful in commercializing our future products outside the United States, either on our own or through third parties, any future product revenue from product sales outside the United States will be materially and adversely affected, which would harm our business.\nWe face substantial competition and our competitors may discover, develop or commercialize products faster or more successfully than us.\nThe development and commercialization of new drug products is highly competitive. We face competition from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies worldwide with respect to ZEMDRI and our product candidates that we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future. There are a number of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that currently market and sell products or are pursuing the development of product candidates for the treatment of MDR infections. Potential competitors also include academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations. Our competitors may succeed in developing, acquiring or licensing technologies and drug products that are more effective, safer or less costly than ZEMDRI or our product candidates that we are currently developing or that we may develop, which could render ZEMDRI and our product candidates obsolete and noncompetitive.\nThere are a variety of available therapies marketed for the treatment of MDR infections that we would expect could compete with ZEMDRI, including but not limited to Avycaz\u00ae (ceftazadime/avibactam), which is marketed by Allergan plc in the United States and marketed by Pfizer outside the United States, VabomereTM (meropenem/vaborbactam), which is marketed by Melinta Therapeutics, ZerbaxaTM (ceftolozane/tazobactam) which is marketed by Merck, meropenem marketed by Pfizer as Merrem\u00ae, ertapenem which is marketed by Merck at EnvanzTM, XeravaTM (eravacycline), which is marketed by Tetraphase Pharmaceuticals, Inc., other aminoglycosides that are generically available (such as gentamicin, amikacin, tobramycin), and polymixins that are generically available (colistin and polymixin B). Many of the available therapies are well-established and widely accepted by physicians, patients and third-party payors. Insurers and other third-party payors may also encourage the use of generic products.\nThere are also a number of products in late-stage clinical development by third parties to treat MDR gram-negative infections. Merck & Co., Inc. is developing imipenem/relebactam for certain life-threatening infections caused by MDR strains, including infections due to metallo-beta-lactamase producing gram-negative pathogens. Nabriva Therapeutics plc is developing Contepo\u2122 (intravenous fosfomycin) for cUTI. Shionogi is developing cefiderocol for carbapenem-resistant gram-negative pathogens. Allergan plc and Pfizer Inc. are developing aztreonam/avibactam for infections caused by MDR strains. Iterum is developing sulopenem for uUTI and cUTI and Spero Therapeutics is developing tebipenem for cUTI. We may also eventually face competition from products in earlier development stage. If our competitors obtain marketing approval from the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities for their product candidates more rapidly than us, it could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market.\nIn July 2012, the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act was passed, which included the Generating Antibiotics Incentives Now (\u201cGAIN\u201d) Act. The GAIN Act provides incentives for the development of new, qualified infectious disease products, including adding five years to the otherwise applicable regulatory exclusivity period. The incentives provided under the GAIN Act, along with government contract funding and other incentives for antibiotic research, may result in more competition in the market for new antibiotics.\nIn addition to the GAIN Act, the 21st Century Cures Act was signed into law in December 2016. This act establishes a new mechanism to help streamline the development programs for certain antibacterial and antifungal drugs that are intended to treat serious or potentially fatal infections in limited populations of patients where unmet need exists due to lack of available therapies. This mechanism, referred to as the limited population pathway for certain antibacterial and antifungal drugs, would permit FDA to rely on data primarily targeting these limited populations and approve such drugs for limited patient populations, notwithstanding a lack of evidence to fully establish a favorable benefit-risk profile in a population that is broader than the intended limited population. The statement \u201cLimited Population\u201d would appear prominently next to the drug\u2019s name in labeling, which would provide notice to healthcare providers that the drug is indicated for use in a limited and specific population of patients. The limited population statement, additional labeling statements describing the data, and FDA review of promotional materials, are intended to help assure these drugs are used narrowly to treat these serious and life-threatening infections while additional evidence is generated to assess safety and effectiveness for broader use. The 21st Century Cures Act also provides a mechanism to establish, update, and communicate susceptibility test interpretive criteria for antimicrobial drugs. Although the 21st Century Cures Act and other contemplated acts in this space may help or support us, they also increase competition in the market for antimicrobials and provide incentives for the potential of new competitors in this disease area.\nMany of our competitors have materially greater name recognition and financial, manufacturing, marketing, research and drug development resources than we do. Additional mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated in our competitors. Large pharmaceutical companies in particular have extensive expertise in preclinical and clinical testing and in obtaining regulatory approvals for drugs. In addition, academic institutions, government agencies, and other public and private organizations conducting research may seek patent protection with respect to potentially competitive products or technologies. These organizations may also establish exclusive collaborative or licensing relationships with our competitors.\nFinally, the success of any product that is successfully commercialized will depend in large part on our ability to prevent competitors from launching a generic version that would compete with such product. If such competitors are able to establish that our patents are invalid or not infringed by the generic version of our product, they may be\nable to launch a generic product prior to the expected expiration of our relevant patents, and any generic competition could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nWe may also attempt to form collaborations in the future with respect to ZEMDRI and our technology and product candidates, but we may not be able to do so, which may cause us to alter our development and commercialization plans.\nWe may form strategic alliances, create joint ventures or collaborations or enter into licensing arrangements with third parties with respect to our programs that we believe will complement or augment our existing business. We face significant competition in seeking appropriate strategic partners, and the negotiation process to secure appropriate terms is time-consuming and complex. We may not be successful in our efforts to establish strategic partnerships for ZEMDRI or our product candidates and programs on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all.\nAny delays in identifying suitable collaborators and entering into agreements to develop or commercialize our products or product candidates could negatively impact the development or commercialization of our products or product candidates in geographic regions where we do not have development and commercialization infrastructure. Absent a collaboration partner for the commercialization of ZEMDRI or for our product candidates, we would need to undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense. If we elect to fund and undertake development or commercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional expertise and additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we are unable to do so, we may not be able to develop our products or product candidates or bring them to market within or outside of the United States in a timely manner or at all and our business may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may be unable to realize the potential benefits of any collaboration.\nEven if we are successful in entering into a collaboration with respect to the development or commercialization of one or more products or product candidates, there is no guarantee that the collaboration will be successful. Collaborations may pose a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\ncollaborators often have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to the collaboration, and may not commit sufficient resources to the development, marketing or commercialization of the product or products that are subject to the collaboration;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may not perform their obligations as expected;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may cease to devote resources to the development or commercialization of our products or product candidates if the collaborators view our products or product candidates as competitive with their own products or product candidates;\n\u2022\ndisagreements with collaborators, including disagreements over proprietary rights, contract interpretation or the course of development, might cause delays or termination of the development or commercialization of product candidates, and might result in legal proceedings, which would be time-consuming, distracting and expensive;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may be impacted by changes in their strategic focus or available funding, or business combinations involving them, which could cause them to divert resources away from the collaboration;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may expose us to litigation and potential liability;\n\u2022\nthe collaborations may not result in us achieving revenue to justify such transactions; and\n\u2022\ncollaborations may be terminated and, if terminated, may result in a need for us to raise additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable product or product candidate.\nAs a result, a collaboration may not result in the successful development or commercialization of our products or product candidates.\nWe are highly dependent on the services of our executive team and our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel.\nWe may not be able to attract or retain qualified management and scientific and clinical personnel in the future due to the intense competition for qualified personnel among biotechnology, pharmaceutical and other businesses, particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area. We are highly dependent on the principal members of our management and scientific staff, particularly our executive team. If we are not able to retain our executive team or are not able to attract, on acceptable terms, additional qualified personnel necessary for the continued development of our business, we may not be able to sustain our operations or grow. Although we have executed employment agreements with each member of our current executive management team, we may not be able to retain their services as expected. In addition to the competition for personnel, the San Francisco Bay Area in particular is characterized by a high cost of living. We may be required to expend significant financial resources in our employee recruitment and retention efforts, particularly if we file for bankruptcy protection.\nIn addition, we have scientific and clinical advisors who assist us in formulating our product development and clinical strategies. These advisors are not our employees and may have commitments to, or consulting or advisory contracts with, other entities that may limit their availability to us, or may have arrangements with other companies to assist in the development of products that may compete with ours.\nOur ability to attract, retain and motivate necessary personnel may further be challenged by our recent corporate restructurings. These restructurings may make future potential executives and employees wary to accept roles with us.\nIf we are not able to attract, retain and motivate necessary personnel to accomplish our business objectives, we may experience constraints that will significantly impede the achievement of our development objectives, our ability to raise additional capital and our ability to implement our business strategy.\nOur recent corporate restructurings and any similar changes in the future may serve as a significant distraction for our management and employees and may negatively affect our product revenues from ZEMDRI.\nWe have conducted three significant corporate restructurings since July 2018, including one which commenced on February 28, 2019, which each resulted in the elimination of a significant amount of our workforce. In addition, we may file a voluntary petition for relief under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, which may result in further restructurings. Such changes, or any other future changes in our executive leadership or in our workforce generally, may disrupt our operations as we assimilate new leadership and potential differing perspectives on our strategic direction and as we adjust to the reallocation of responsibilities among our workforce. If transitions in executive leadership, our workforce or corporate structure are not smooth, the resulting disruption could negatively affect our operations and employees\u2019 morale and could impede our ability to attract and retain personnel and execute our strategic plan. In addition, the corporate restructuring and similar changes in the future could lead to legal claims which may be time consuming and expensive to manage. If such costs are substantial, this could significantly harm our financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, the corporate restructurings may negatively affect our product revenues from ZEMDRI as a result of reductions in the number of our employees focused on commercialization of ZEMDRI.\nOur business could be negatively affected as a result of a proxy contest or certain other stockholder actions or disputes.\nResponding to certain stockholder actions and disputes can be costly, disruptive and time-consuming, and could also impact our ability to attract, retain and motivate our employees. For example, a proxy contest for our annual meeting of stockholders relating to stockholder proposals or director nominees would require significant time and could divert the attention of our management, other employees and our board of directors. In addition, a proxy contest would require us to incur significant costs, including legal fees and proxy solicitation expenses. Any disputes with stockholders, including stockholder litigation, would similarly be distracting, time consuming and expensive to manage.\nOur business involves the use of hazardous materials and we and our third-party manufacturers must comply with environmental laws and regulations, which may be expensive and restrict how we do business.\nOur third-party manufacturers\u2019 activities and our own activities involve the controlled storage, use and disposal of hazardous materials, including the components of our pharmaceutical products and product candidates, test samples and reagents, biological materials and other hazardous compounds. We and our manufacturers are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations governing the use, generation, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these hazardous materials. We currently carry no insurance specifically covering environmental claims relating to the use of hazardous materials. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials and waste products comply with the standards prescribed by these laws and regulations, we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental injury or contamination from the use, storage, handling or disposal of hazardous materials. In the event of an accident, state or federal or other applicable authorities may curtail our use of these materials and/or interrupt our business operations. In addition, if an accident or environmental discharge occurs, or if we discover contamination caused by prior operations, including by prior owners and operators of properties we acquire, we could be liable for cleanup obligations, damages and fines. If such unexpected costs are substantial, this could significantly harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur internal computer systems, or those of our CROs or other contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer security breaches, which could result in a material disruption of our business operations.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our CROs and other contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage or disruption from computer viruses, software bugs, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war, and telecommunication, equipment and electrical failures. While we have not, to our knowledge, experienced any significant system failure, accident or security breach to date, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our programs. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or ongoing clinical trials for any of our product candidates could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss of or damage to our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure or theft of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability, or adversely affect our business operations and/or financial condition.\nWe rely significantly on information technology and services that utilize the cloud computing environment and any failure, inadequacy, interruption or security lapse of that technology, including any cybersecurity incidents, could harm our ability to operate our business effectively.\nWe rely significantly on our information technology to effectively manage and maintain our clinical records, internal infrastructure systems and internal reports. Any failure, inadequacy or interruption of that infrastructure or security lapse of that technology, including cybersecurity incidents, could harm our ability to operate our business effectively. Cybersecurity attacks in particular are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, misappropriation of our confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. A breach in security, unauthorized access resulting in misappropriation, theft, or sabotage with respect to our proprietary and confidential information, including research or clinical data, could require significant capital investments to remediate and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, CROs, consultants and vendors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements.\nWe are exposed to the risk that our employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, CROs, consultants and vendors may engage in fraudulent or other illegal activity. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional, reckless and/or negligent conduct or disclosure of unauthorized activities to us that violates: (1) FDA regulations, including those laws requiring the reporting of true, complete and accurate information to the FDA; (2) manufacturing standards; (3) federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations; or (4) laws that require the true, complete and accurate reporting of financial information or data. Specifically, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other\nbusiness arrangements. Activities subject to these laws also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. It is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by our employees and other third parties, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.\nWe incur significant costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management devotes substantial time to new compliance initiatives.\nPrior to our initial public offering (\u201cIPO\u201d) in March 2014, we had not been subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), or the other rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) or any securities exchange relating to public companies. We continue to identify those areas in which changes should be made to our financial and management control systems to manage our growth and our obligations as a public company. These areas include corporate governance, corporate control, disclosure controls and procedures and financial reporting and accounting systems. We have made, and will continue to make, changes in these and other areas. Expenses associated with being a public company are material. Compliance with the various reporting and other requirements applicable to public companies requires considerable time and attention of management. In addition, the changes we make may not be sufficient to allow us to satisfy our obligations as a public company on a timely basis.\nIn addition, certain types of insurance, including directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance are more expensive as a public company. Being a public company makes it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as executive officers.\nIf we are not able to adequately comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we may be subject to sanctions by regulatory authorities.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and provide a management report on the internal control over financial reporting. If we have a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting, as occurred in for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, we may not detect errors on a timely basis and our financial statements may be materially misstated. As of December 31, 2018, our management believes our internal controls were effective, and our independent auditors have attested that the operation of our internal controls was effective as of December 31, 2018; however, there can be no assurance that management and our independent auditors will be able to make similar reports in the future.\nIf in the future we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identifies deficiencies in our internal controls that are deemed to be material weaknesses, as occurred for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which would entail expenditure of additional financial and management resources and could materially adversely affect our stock price. Deficient internal controls could also cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations or cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on our stock price.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud.\nWe have designed our disclosure controls and procedures to reasonably assure that information we must disclose in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, and recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. We believe that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures, no matter how well-conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.\nThese inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the acts of some individuals, by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the controls. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in our control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nFor example, in connection with the preparation of our interim financial statements for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to a design deficiency in our internal controls over the preparation and review of our earnings per share calculation. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected and corrected on a timely basis. Specifically, our controls were not adequately designed to ensure that all potentially dilutive securities were accurately reflected in the calculation of our diluted earnings per share.\nWe implemented a remediation plan to address the underlying causes of the material weakness described above. The remediation plan included:\n\u2022\nReassessing the design and operation of internal controls over financial reporting, including setting up a model with sufficient detail to ensure that all potentially dilutive securities were accurately reflected in the calculation of our diluted earnings per share;\n\u2022\nTraining of accounting personnel to further educate the staff on the accounting of new and ongoing complex and/or technical transactions relevant to us; and\n\u2022\nIncreasing staffing levels and expertise to implement this remediation plan.\nAs of December 31, 2018, our management believes our internal controls were effective, and our independent auditors have attested that the operation of our internal controls was effective as of December 31, 2018, however there can be no assurance that management and our independent auditors will be able to make similar reports in the future. We cannot assure that the measures we took in response to this material weakness are sufficient to avoid potential future material weaknesses.\nAdditionally, we cannot provide assurance that a similar material weakness will not recur, or that we will be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the related rules and regulations of the SEC when required. If we cannot in the future favorably assess, or our independent registered public accounting firm, when required, is unable to provide an unqualified attestation report on, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investor confidence in the reliability of our financial reports may be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our stock price. In addition, any failure to report our financial results on an accurate and timely basis could result in sanctions, lawsuits, delisting of our shares from The Nasdaq Global Market or other adverse consequences that would materially harm our business.\nWe or the third parties upon whom we depend may be adversely affected by earthquakes or other natural disasters and our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect us from a serious disaster.\nOur corporate headquarters is located in the San Francisco Bay Area, which in the past has experienced severe earthquakes. We do not carry earthquake insurance. Earthquakes or other natural disasters could severely disrupt our operations, and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nIf a natural disaster, power outage or other event occurred that prevented us from using all or a significant portion of our headquarters, that damaged critical infrastructure, such as our information technology systems, or that otherwise disrupted operations, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible for us to continue our business for a substantial period of time. The disaster recovery and business continuity plans we have in place currently are limited and are unlikely to prove adequate in the event of a serious disaster or similar event. We may incur substantial expenses as a result of the limited nature of our disaster recovery and business continuity plans, which,\nparticularly when taken together with our lack of earthquake insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFurthermore, integral parties in our supply chain are geographically concentrated and operating from single sites, increasing their vulnerability to natural disasters or other sudden, unforeseen and severe adverse events. If such an event were to affect our supply chain, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nUnder Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d (generally defined as a greater than 50 percentage points change (by value) in the ownership of its equity by certain significant stockholders over a rolling three year period), the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and certain other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income and taxes may be limited. We may have experienced such ownership changes in the past, and we may experience ownership changes in the future and/or subsequent shifts in our stock ownership, some of which would be outside our control. If our ability to use our net operating losses and other tax attributes is limited by ownership changes, we may be unable to utilize a material portion of our net operating losses and other tax attributes.\nRisks Related to Our U.S. Government Contracts and to Certain Grant Agreements\nOur use of government funding for certain of our programs adds uncertainty to our research and commercialization efforts with respect to those programs and may impose requirements that increase the costs of commercialization and production of product candidates developed under those government-funded programs.\nOur development of products has been funded in significant part through contracts with BARDA. Contracts funded by the U.S. government and its agencies include provisions that reflect the government\u2019s substantial rights and remedies, many of which are not typically found in commercial contracts, including powers of the government to:\n\u2022\nterminate agreements, in whole or in part, for any reason or no reason;\n\u2022\nreduce or modify the government\u2019s obligations under such agreements without the consent of the other party;\n\u2022\nclaim rights, including intellectual property rights, in products and data developed under such agreements;\n\u2022\naudit contract-related costs and fees, including allocated indirect costs;\n\u2022\nsuspend the contractor from receiving new contracts pending resolution of alleged violations of procurement laws or regulations;\n\u2022\nimpose U.S. manufacturing requirements for products that embody inventions conceived or first reduced to practice under such agreements;\n\u2022\nsuspend or debar the contractor from doing future business with the government;\n\u2022\ncontrol and potentially prohibit the export of products; and\n\u2022\npursue criminal or civil remedies under the False Claims Act (\u201cFCA\u201d), the False Statements Act and similar remedy provisions specific to government agreements.\nWe may not have the right to prohibit the U.S. government from using or allowing others to use certain technologies developed by us, and we may not be able to prohibit third-party companies, including our competitors, from using those technologies in providing products and services to the U.S. government. The U.S. government generally obtains the right to royalty-free use of technologies that are developed under U.S. government contracts.\nIn addition, government contracts normally contain additional requirements that may increase our costs of doing business, reduce our profits, and expose us to liability for failure to comply with these terms and conditions. These requirements include, for example:\n\u2022\nspecialized accounting systems unique to government contracts;\n\u2022\nmandatory financial audits and potential liability for price adjustments or recoupment of government funds after such funds have been spent;\n\u2022\npublic disclosures of certain contract information, which may enable competitors to gain insights into our research program; and\n\u2022\nmandatory socioeconomic compliance requirements, including labor standards, anti-human-trafficking, non-discrimination, and affirmative action programs and environmental compliance requirements.\nIf we fail to maintain compliance with these requirements, we may be subject to potential contract or FCA liability and to termination of our contracts.\nU.S. government agencies have special contracting requirements that give them the ability to unilaterally control our contracts.\nU.S. government contracts typically contain unfavorable termination provisions and are subject to audit and modification by the government at its sole discretion, which will subject us to additional risks. These risks include the ability of the U.S. government to unilaterally:\n\u2022\naudit and object to our BARDA contract-related costs and fees, and require us to reimburse all such costs and fees;\n\u2022\nsuspend or prevent us for a set period of time from receiving new contracts or extending our existing contracts based on violations or suspected violations of laws or regulations;\n\u2022\ncancel, terminate or suspend our contracts based on violations or suspected violations of laws or regulations;\n\u2022\nterminate our contracts if in the government\u2019s interest, including if funds become unavailable to the applicable governmental agency;\n\u2022\nreduce the scope and value of our contract; and\n\u2022\nchange certain terms and conditions in our contract.\nThe U.S. government will be able to terminate any of its contracts with us, either for convenience or if we default by failing to perform in accordance with or to achieve the milestones set forth in the contract schedules and terms. Termination-for-convenience provisions generally enable us to recover only our costs incurred or committed and settlement expenses on the work completed prior to termination. Except for the amount of services received by the government, termination-for-default provisions do not permit these recoveries and would make us liable for excess costs incurred by the U.S. government in procuring undelivered items from another source.\nThe U.S. government\u2019s determination to award a future contract or contract option may be challenged by an interested party, such as another bidder, at the U.S. Government Accountability Office (the \u201cGAO\u201d), or in federal court. If such a challenge is successful, our BARDA contracts or any future contract we may be awarded may be terminated.\nThe laws and regulations governing the procurement of goods and services by the U.S. government provide procedures by which other bidders and interested parties may challenge the award of a government contract. If we are awarded a government contract, such challenges or protests could be filed even if there are not any valid legal grounds on which to base the protest. If any such protests are filed, the government agency may decide to suspend our performance under the contract while such protests are being considered by the GAO or the applicable federal court, thus potentially delaying delivery of payment. In addition, we could be forced to expend considerable funds to\ndefend any potential award. If a protest is successful, the government may be ordered to terminate any one or more of our contracts and reselect bids. The government agencies with which we have contracts could even be directed to award a potential contract to one of the other bidders.\nOur business is subject to audit by the U.S. government and other potential sources for grant funding, including under our contract with BARDA, and a negative outcome in an audit could adversely affect our business.\nU.S. government agencies such as the Department of Health and Human Services (\u201cDHHS\u201d) and the Defense Contract Audit Agency (the \u201cDCAA\u201d) routinely audit and investigate government contractors. These agencies review a contractor\u2019s performance under its contracts, cost structure and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards.\nThe DHHS and the DCAA also review the adequacy of, and a contractor\u2019s compliance with, its internal control systems and policies, including the contractor\u2019s purchasing, property, estimating, compensation and management information systems. Any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be paid, while such costs already paid must be refunded. If an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including:\n\u2022\ntermination of contracts;\n\u2022\nforfeiture of profits;\n\u2022\nsuspension of payments;\n\u2022\nfines; and\n\u2022\nsuspension or prohibition from conducting business with the U.S. government.\nIn addition, we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us, which could cause our stock price to decrease.\nLaws and regulations affecting government contracts make it more expensive and difficult for us to successfully conduct our business.\nWe must comply with numerous laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of government contracts, which can make it more difficult for us to retain our rights under our BARDA contracts. These laws and regulations affect how we conduct business with government agencies. Among the most significant government contracting regulations that affect our business are:\n\u2022\nthe Federal Acquisition Regulations (\u201cFAR\u201d) and agency-specific regulations supplemental to the FAR, which comprehensively regulate the procurement, formation, administration and performance of government contracts;\n\u2022\nbusiness ethics and public integrity obligations, which govern conflicts of interest and the hiring of former government employees, restrict the granting of gratuities and funding of lobbying activities and include other requirements such as the Anti-Kickback Statute and Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;\n\u2022\nexport and import control laws and regulations; and\n\u2022\nlaws, regulations and executive orders restricting the use and dissemination of information classified for national security purposes and the exportation of certain products and technical data.\nAny changes in applicable laws and regulations could restrict our ability to maintain our existing BARDA contracts and obtain new contracts, which could limit our ability to conduct our business and materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain sufficient intellectual property protection for our product or product candidates, or if the scope of the intellectual property protection is not sufficiently broad, our competitors could develop and commercialize products similar or identical to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates may be adversely affected.\nWe rely upon a combination of patents, trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect the intellectual property related to our technologies. If we do not adequately protect our intellectual property, competitors may be able to use our technologies and erode or negate any competitive advantage we may have, which could harm our business and ability to achieve profitability. In particular, our success depends in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in the United States and other countries with respect to our product and product candidates. However, we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. We may also fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development before it is too late to obtain patent protection.\nFurther, the patentability of inventions, and the validity, enforceability and scope of patents in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical field involve complex legal and scientific questions and can be uncertain. As a result, patent applications that we own or license may fail to result in issued patents in the United States or in other foreign countries for many reasons. For example, there is no assurance that we were the first to invent or the first to file patent applications in respect of the inventions claimed in our patent applications. Since patent applications in the United States and most other countries are confidential for a period of time after filing, we cannot be certain that we were the first to file any patent application related to our product candidates. We may also be unaware of certain prior art relating to our patent applications and patents, which could prevent a patent from issuing from a pending patent application, or result in an issued patent being invalidated. Even if patents have issued, or do successfully issue, from patent applications, third parties may challenge the validity, enforceability or scope thereof, which may result in such patents being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable. Furthermore, even if they are unchallenged, our patents and patent applications may not adequately protect our intellectual property or prevent others from designing around our claims. If the breadth or strength of protection provided by the patents and patent applications we hold, license or pursue with respect to our product candidates is threatened, it could threaten our ability to commercialize our product candidates. Further, if we encounter delays in our clinical trials, the period of time during which we could market any of our product candidates under patent protection, if approved, would be reduced. Changes to the patent laws in the United States and other jurisdictions could also diminish the value of our patents and patent applications or narrow the scope of our patent protection.\nFurther, one of our product candidates, C-Scape, involves an innovative treatment combination of two previously-identified and approved products. In addition to all of the risks and uncertainties with pharmaceutical candidates in general, these prior products have extensive patent and intellectual property portfolios that once protected them and may continue to protect certain aspects of these products. Such portfolios create additional risks and uncertainties for our own ability to obtain material patent or intellectual property protection on our combination development candidate, including the possibility that existing patents or applications relate to and cover combinations of these same products or product classes and the possibility that prior patent positions on these compounds will make it more difficult for us to obtain our own affirmative patents in this area. Antibacterial products are commonly used in combination with one another in research, development and treatment. We may not be aware of all the ways these prior products have been used in combination and of the various intellectual property that may relate to such combination or combinations or the prior uses of these compounds that may prevent us from obtaining our own intellectual property.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, the value of our technology could be materially adversely affected and our business would be harmed.\nIn addition to the protection afforded by patents, we rely on confidential proprietary information, including trade secrets, and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position. Any disclosure to or misappropriation by third parties of our confidential proprietary information could enable competitors to quickly duplicate or surpass our technological achievements, thus eroding our competitive position in our market. We seek to protect our confidential proprietary information, in part, by confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors and collaborators. These agreements are\ndesigned to protect our proprietary information. However, we cannot be certain that such agreements have been entered into with all relevant parties, and we cannot be certain that our trade secrets and other confidential proprietary information will not be disclosed or that competitors will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques. For example, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our confidential proprietary information by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems, but it is possible that these security measures could be breached. If any of our confidential proprietary information were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent such competitor from using that technology or information to compete with us, which could harm our competitive position. Further, the laws of some foreign countries, including China, where we currently source raw materials for ZEMDRI, do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent or in the same manner as the laws of the United States. As a result, we may encounter significant problems in protecting and defending our intellectual property both in the United States and abroad. If we are unable to prevent material disclosure of the intellectual property related to our technologies to third parties, we will not be able to establish or maintain a competitive advantage in our market, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we are sued for infringing intellectual property rights of third parties, such litigation could be costly and time consuming and could prevent or delay us from developing or commercializing our product and/or product candidates.\nThere is a substantial amount of intellectual property litigation in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, and we may become party to, or threatened with, litigation or other adversarial proceedings regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our technology, ZEMDRI or our product candidates, including proceedings such as post-grant review and inter partes review (\u201cIPR\u201d) before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cUSPTO\u201d). Third parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing or future intellectual property rights. The outcome of intellectual property litigation is subject to uncertainties that cannot be adequately quantified in advance. The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have produced a significant number of patents, and it may not always be clear to industry participants, including us, which patents cover various types of products or methods of use. The coverage of patents is subject to interpretation by the courts, and the interpretation is not always uniform. If we are sued for patent infringement, we would need to demonstrate that our product candidates, products or methods either do not infringe the patent claims of the relevant patent or that the patent claims are invalid, and we may not be able to do this. Proving that a patent is invalid is difficult. For example, in the United States, proving invalidity requires a showing of clear and convincing evidence to overcome the presumption of validity enjoyed by issued patents. Even if we are successful in these proceedings, we may incur substantial costs and the time and attention of our management and scientific personnel could be diverted in pursuing these proceedings, which could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, we may not have sufficient resources to bring these actions to a successful conclusion.\nIf we are found to infringe a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, we could be forced, including by court order, to cease developing, manufacturing or commercializing the infringing product candidate or product. Alternatively, we may be required to obtain a license from such third party in order to use the infringing technology and continue developing, manufacturing or marketing the infringing product candidate or product. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. In addition, we could be found liable for monetary damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing our product or product candidates or force us to cease some of our business operations, which could materially harm our business. We may also elect to enter into license agreements in order to settle patent infringement claims or to resolve disputes prior to litigation, and any such license agreements may require us to pay royalties and other fees that could be significant. Claims that we have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties could have a similar negative impact on our business.\nWe may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe or otherwise violate our patents, the patents of our licensors, or our other intellectual property rights. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming. Any claims that we assert against perceived infringers could also provoke these parties to assert counterclaims against us alleging that we infringe their intellectual property rights. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours is not valid or is unenforceable, in whole or in part, or may refuse to stop the other party in such infringement proceeding from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated, held unenforceable or interpreted narrowly, and could put any of our patent applications at risk of not yielding an issued patent.\nInterference or derivation proceedings provoked by third parties or brought by the USPTO or any foreign patent authority may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions or other matters of inventorship with respect to our patents or patent applications. We may also become involved in other proceedings, such as re-examination or opposition proceedings, before the USPTO or its foreign counterparts relating to our intellectual property or the intellectual property rights of others. An unfavorable outcome in any such proceedings could require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing party, or could cause us to lose valuable intellectual property rights. Our business could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms, if any license is offered at all. Litigation or other proceedings may fail and, even if successful, may result in substantial costs and distract our management and other employees. We may also become involved in disputes with others regarding the ownership of intellectual property rights. For example, we jointly develop intellectual property with certain parties, and disagreements may therefore arise as to the ownership of the intellectual property developed pursuant to these relationships. If we are unable to resolve these disputes, we could lose valuable intellectual property rights.\nWe may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our trade secrets or confidential information, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the United States. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nEven if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses, and could distract our technical and/or management personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce the resources available for development activities or any future sales, marketing or distribution activities. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of intellectual property litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on all of our product and product candidates throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and, further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection but where enforcement is not as strong as in the United States. These products may compete with our products in jurisdictions where we do not have any issued patents and our patent claims or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from so competing. Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions, including China, where we currently source raw materials for ZEMDRI. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other\nintellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biopharmaceuticals, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial cost and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business.\nIf we breach any of the agreements with third parties under which we license certain use, development and commercialization rights to ZEMDRI and our product candidates, we could lose license rights that are important to our business.\nWhile we own the primary patent family covering ZEMDRI, our development and commercialization of ZEMDRI is subject to our license agreement with Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (formerly known as Isis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.). Under our existing license agreements, we are subject to various obligations, including diligence obligations with respect to development and commercialization activities, payment obligations for achievement of certain milestones and royalties on product sales, as well as other material obligations. If we fail to comply with any of these obligations or otherwise breach our license agreements, our licensing collaborators may have the right to terminate the applicable license in whole or in part. In particular, the loss of our license agreement with Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. could materially adversely affect our ability to continue commercializing ZEMDRI.\nThe risks described elsewhere pertaining to our patents and other intellectual property rights also apply to the intellectual property rights that we license, and any failure by us or our licensors to obtain, maintain and enforce these rights could have a material adverse effect on our business. In some cases, we do not have control over the prosecution, maintenance or enforcement of the patents that we license, and may not have sufficient ability to consult and input into the patent prosecution and maintenance process with respect to such patents, and our licensors may fail to take the steps that we believe are necessary or desirable in order to obtain, maintain and enforce the licensed patents.\nIntellectual property rights do not necessarily address all potential threats to our competitive advantage.\nThe degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations, and may not adequately protect our business or permit us to maintain our competitive advantage. The following examples are illustrative:\n\u2022\nothers may be able to make compounds that are similar to ZEMDRI or our product candidates but that are not covered by the claims of the patents that we own or license;\n\u2022\nwe or our licensors or collaborators might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by an issued patent or pending patent application that we own or license;\n\u2022\nwe or our licensors or collaborators might not have been the first to file patent applications covering an invention;\n\u2022\nothers may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies without infringing our intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\npending patent applications that we own or license may not lead to issued patents;\n\u2022\nissued patents that we own or license may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or may be held invalid or unenforceable, as a result of legal challenges by our competitors;\n\u2022\nour competitors might conduct research and development activities in countries where we do not have patent rights and then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in our major commercial markets;\n\u2022\nwe may not develop or in-license additional proprietary technologies that are patentable; and\n\u2022\nthe patents of others may have an adverse effect on our business.\nShould any of these events occur, they could significantly harm our business, results of operations and prospects.\nObtaining and maintaining patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nPeriodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and various other governmental fees on patents and/or applications will be due to be paid to the USPTO and various governmental patent agencies outside of the United States in several stages over the lifetime of the patents and/or applications. The USPTO and various non-U.S. governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. In many cases, an inadvertent lapse can be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules. However, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, our competitors might be able to use our technologies and this circumstance would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe do not have exclusive rights to intellectual property we developed under U.S. federally-funded research grants and contracts in connection with certain neglected diseases initiatives, including our collaboration with the Gates Foundation, and, in the case of those funded research activities, we could ultimately share or lose the rights we do have under certain circumstances. Provisions in our U.S. government contracts, including our contracts with BARDA, may affect our intellectual property rights.\nCertain of our activities have been funded, and may in the future be funded, by the U.S. government, including our contracts with BARDA. When new technologies are developed with U.S. government funding, the government obtains certain rights in any resulting patents, including the right to a nonexclusive license authorizing the government to use the invention under these rights that may permit the government to disclose our confidential information to third parties and to exercise \u201cmarch-in\u201d rights to use or allow third parties to use our patented technology. The government can exercise its march-in rights if it determines that action is necessary because we fail to achieve practical application of the U.S. government-funded technology, because action is necessary to alleviate health or safety needs, to meet requirements of federal regulations, or to give preference to U.S. industry. In addition, U.S. government-funded inventions must be reported to the government, U.S. government funding must be disclosed in any resulting patent applications, and our rights in such inventions may be subject to certain requirements to manufacture products in the United States.\nIf we do not obtain patent term extension in the United States under the Hatch-Waxman Act and in foreign countries under similar legislation, thereby potentially extending the term of our marketing exclusivity for our product candidates, our business may be materially harmed.\nDepending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA marketing approval of our product candidates, if any, one or more of our U.S. patents, if any, covering our approved product(s) or the use thereof may be eligible for up to five years of patent term restoration under the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act allows a maximum of one patent to be extended per FDA approved product. Patent term extension also may be available in certain foreign countries upon regulatory approval of our product candidates. Nevertheless, we may not be granted patent term extension either in the United States or in any foreign country because of, for example, failing to apply within applicable deadlines, failing to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise failing to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the term of extension, as well as the scope of patent protection during any such extension, afforded by the governmental authority could be less than we request.\nIf we are unable to obtain patent term extension or restoration, or the term of any such extension is less than we request, the period during which we will have the right to exclusively market our product will be shortened and our competitors may obtain approval of competing products following our patent expiration, and our revenue could be reduced, possibly materially.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation\nThe regulatory approval process is expensive, time consuming and uncertain and may prevent us from obtaining, or cause delays in obtaining, approvals for the commercialization of some or all of our product candidates, and of ZEMDRI outside the United States, which will materially impair our ability to generate revenue.\nThe design, development, research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, approval, selling, import, export, advertising, promotion, and distribution of drug products are subject to extensive and evolving regulation by federal, state and local governmental authorities in the United States, principally by the FDA, and foreign regulatory authorities, with regulations differing from country to country. Failure to obtain marketing approval for a product candidate will prevent us from commercializing the product candidate. Neither we nor any future collaboration partner is permitted to market any product candidate in the United States until we receive regulatory approval of an NDA from the FDA.\nIn June 2018, we announced the receipt of FDA approval for ZEMDRI for adults with cUTI, including pyelonephritis, caused by certain Enterobacteriaceae in patients with limited or no alternative treatment options. In December 2018, we filed a Formal Dispute Resolution Request with the FDA regarding the indication for plazomicin for the treatment of bloodstream infections (BSI), for which the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter in June 2018. In October 2018, we filed a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for plazomicin with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in the fourth quarter of 2018. We recently received the Day 120 questions and we continue to advance the regulatory process with the rapporteurs and the EMA.\nOther than the NDA for ZEMDRI and the MAA for plazomicin, we have not submitted an application or obtained marketing approval for ZEMDRI or any product candidate anywhere in the world. An NDA must include extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to establish to the FDA\u2019s satisfaction the product candidate\u2019s safety and efficacy for each desired indication. An NDA must also include significant information regarding the chemistry, manufacturing and controls for the product candidate. Obtaining regulatory approval of an NDA can be a lengthy, expensive and uncertain process. In addition, failure to comply with FDA and other applicable U.S. and foreign regulatory requirements may subject us to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions, including:\n\u2022\nwarning letters;\n\u2022\ncivil and criminal penalties;\n\u2022\ninjunctions;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of approved products;\n\u2022\nproduct seizure or detention;\n\u2022\nproduct recalls;\n\u2022\ntotal or partial suspension of production; and\n\u2022\nrefusal to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs.\nPrior to receiving approval to commercialize any of our product candidates in the United States or abroad, we and any applicable collaboration partners must demonstrate with substantial evidence from well-controlled clinical trials, and to the satisfaction of the FDA and other regulatory authorities abroad, that such product candidates are safe and effective for their intended uses. Preclinical testing and clinical trials are long, expensive and uncertain processes. We may spend several years completing our testing for any particular product candidate, and failure can occur at any stage. Negative or inconclusive results or adverse medical events during a clinical trial could also cause the FDA or us to terminate a clinical trial or require that we repeat it or conduct additional clinical trials. Additionally, data obtained from preclinical studies and clinical trials can be interpreted in different ways and the FDA or other regulatory authorities may interpret the results of our studies and trials less favorably than we do. Even if we believe the preclinical or clinical data for a product candidate is promising, such data may not be sufficient to support approval by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. Administering any product candidates to\nhumans may produce undesirable side effects, which could interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials of such product candidates and result in the FDA or other regulatory authorities denying approval of such product candidates for any or all targeted indications. The FDA or other regulatory authorities may determine that ZEMDRI or any product candidate that we develop is not effective, or is only moderately effective, or has undesirable or unintended side effects, toxicities, safety profile or other characteristics that preclude marketing approval or prevent or limit commercial use. In addition, any marketing approval we ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-approval commitments that render the approved product not commercially viable.\nThe regulatory approval process is expensive and may take several years to complete. The FDA and foreign regulatory entities have substantial discretion in the approval process. Despite the time and expense exerted, failure can occur at any stage, and we could encounter problems that cause us to abandon or repeat clinical trials, or perform additional preclinical studies and clinical trials. The number of preclinical studies and clinical trials that will be required for FDA approval varies depending on the product candidate, the disease or condition that the product candidate is designed to address, and the regulations applicable to any particular product candidate. The FDA can delay, limit or deny approval of a product candidate for many reasons, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nproduct candidate may not be deemed safe or effective;\n\u2022\nFDA officials may not find the data from preclinical studies and clinical trials sufficient;\n\u2022\nthe FDA may request additional analyses, reports, data and studies;\n\u2022\nthe FDA may ask questions regarding, or adopt different interpretations of, data and results;\n\u2022\nthe FDA might not approve our or our third-party manufacturer\u2019s processes or facilities; or\n\u2022\nthe FDA may change its approval policies or adopt new regulations.\nIf any of our product candidates fails to demonstrate safety and efficacy in clinical trials or does not gain regulatory approval, or if we experience delays in obtaining regulatory approval, our business and results of operations will be materially and adversely harmed.\nEven after we receive regulatory approval for a product candidate, we are subject to ongoing regulatory obligations and continued regulatory review, which may result in significant additional expense and subject us to restrictions, withdrawal from the market, or penalties if we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements or if we experience unanticipated problems with our product and/or product candidates, when and if approved.\nEven after regulatory approval has been granted, the approved product and its manufacturer are subject to continual review by the FDA and/or non-U.S. regulatory authorities. Any regulatory approval that we receive for our product candidates may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or contain requirements for potentially costly post-marketing follow-up studies or surveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of the product. In addition, if the FDA and/or non-U.S. regulatory authorities approve any of our product candidates, we will be subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements by the FDA and other regulatory authorities with regard to labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, storage, distribution, advertising, promotion, recordkeeping and submission of safety and other post-market information. Manufacturers of our products and manufacturers\u2019 facilities are required to comply with cGMP regulations, which include requirements related to quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Further, regulatory authorities must approve these manufacturing facilities before they can be used to manufacture our products, and these facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with cGMP regulations. Accordingly, we and others with whom we work must continue to expend time, money and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance, including manufacturing, production and quality control. We will also be required to report certain adverse reactions and production problems, if any, to the FDA and to comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotion for our products. If we, any future collaboration partner or a regulatory authority discovers previously unknown problems with a product, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, a regulatory authority may impose restrictions on that product, the collaboration partner, the manufacturer or us, including requiring withdrawal of the product from the market or suspension of manufacturing.\nThe FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs to ensure drugs are marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling and regulatory requirements. The FDA also imposes stringent restrictions on manufacturers\u2019 communications regarding off-label use and if we do not restrict the marketing of our products only to their approved indications, we may be subject to enforcement action for off-label marketing. If we, our product and product candidates or the manufacturing facilities for our product and product candidates fail to comply with regulatory requirements of the FDA and/or other non-U.S. regulatory authorities, we could be subject to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions, including:\n\u2022\nwarning letters or untitled letters;\n\u2022\nmandated modifications to promotional materials or the required provision of corrective information to healthcare practitioners;\n\u2022\nrestrictions imposed on the product or its manufacturers or manufacturing processes;\n\u2022\nrestrictions imposed on the labeling or marketing of the product;\n\u2022\nrestrictions imposed on product distribution or use;\n\u2022\nrequirements for post-marketing clinical trials;\n\u2022\nsuspension of any ongoing clinical trials;\n\u2022\nsuspension of or withdrawal of regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nvoluntary or mandatory product recalls and publicity requirements;\n\u2022\nrefusal to approve pending applications for marketing approval of new products or supplements to approved applications filed by us;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements;\n\u2022\nseizure or detention of our products;\n\u2022\nrefusal to permit the import or export of our products;\n\u2022\nrequired entry into a consent decree, which can include imposition of various fines (including restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenue), reimbursements for inspection costs, required due dates for specific actions and penalties for noncompliance;\n\u2022\ncivil or criminal penalties; or\n\u2022\ninjunctions.\nWidely publicized events concerning the safety risk of certain drug products have resulted in the withdrawal of drug products, revisions to drug labeling that further limit use of the drug products and the imposition by the FDA of risk evaluation and mitigation strategies (\u201cREMS\u201d) to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. In addition, because of the serious public health risks of high profile adverse safety events with certain products, the FDA may require, as a condition of approval, costly REMS programs.\nThe regulatory requirements and policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted for which we may also be required to comply. For example, in December 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act, or Cures Act, was signed into law. The Cures Act, among other things, is intended to modernize the regulation of drugs and spur innovation, but its ultimate implementation is unclear. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we or any future collaboration partner are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained, which would adversely affect our business, prospects and ability to achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or in other countries. For example, certain policies of the current presidential administration may impact our business and industry. The current administration has taken several executive actions, including the issuance of a number of Executive Orders, that could impose significant burdens on, or otherwise materially delay, FDA\u2019s ability to engage in routine regulatory and oversight activities such as implementing statutes through rulemaking, issuance of guidance, and review and approval of marketing applications. It is difficult to predict how these Executive Orders will be implemented, and the extent to which they will impact the FDA\u2019s ability to exercise its regulatory authority. If these executive actions impose constraints on FDA\u2019s ability to engage in oversight and implementation activities in the normal course, our business may be negatively impacted.\nFailure to obtain regulatory approvals in foreign jurisdictions will prevent us from marketing our product or product candidates internationally.\nWe may seek a distribution and marketing collaborator for ZEMDRI or our product candidates commercialized outside of the United States. In order to market our product or product candidates in the European Economic Area (the \u201cEEA\u201d), which is comprised of the 28 Member States of the EU, plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, and many other foreign jurisdictions, we or our collaboration partners must obtain separate regulatory approvals. More concretely, in the EEA, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization (\u201cMA\u201d). There are two types of marketing authorizations:\n\u2022\nthe Community MA, which is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the EMA, and which is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as for drugs produced through certain specified biotechnological processes (such as recombinant DNA technology, controlled expression of genes coding for biologically active proteins in prokaryotes and eukaryotes including transformed mammalian cells, and hybridoma and monoclonal antibody methods), advanced therapy medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, and medicinal products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of specified diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune diseases and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU.\n\u2022\nnational MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member State through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure.\nUnder the above described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.\nWe have had limited interactions with foreign regulatory authorities, and approval procedures vary among countries and can involve additional clinical testing. In addition, the time required to obtain approval from foreign regulatory authorities may differ from that required to obtain FDA approval. Clinical trials conducted in one country may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other countries. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries, and approval by one or more foreign regulatory authorities does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other foreign countries or by the FDA. However, a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may have a negative effect on our ability to obtain approval in other countries. The foreign regulatory approval process generally includes all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval. In addition, in many countries outside the United States, it is required that the product be approved for reimbursement before the product can be approved for sale in that country. We may or may not obtain foreign\nregulatory approvals on a timely basis, if at all. We may not be able to file for regulatory approvals and even if we file, we may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our product candidates in any market.\nHealthcare reform measures could hinder or prevent our product or product candidates\u2019 commercial success.\nIn the United States, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could affect our future revenue and profitability and the future revenue and profitability of our potential customers. Federal and state lawmakers regularly propose and, at times, enact legislation that results in significant changes to the healthcare system, some of which is intended to contain or reduce the costs of medical products and services. For example, in March 2010, the President signed one of the most significant healthcare reform measures in decades, the Affordable Care Act (\u201cACA\u201d). It contains a number of provisions, including those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement changes and fraud and abuse measures, all of which will impact existing government healthcare programs and will result in the development of new programs. The ACA, among other things:\n\u2022\nimposes a non-deductible annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell \u201cbranded prescription drugs\u201d to specified federal government programs;\n\u2022\nincreases the minimum level of Medicaid rebates payable by manufacturers of brand-name drugs from 15.1% to 23.1%;\n\u2022\nimposes a 2.3% medical device excise tax that manufacturers and importers will be required to pay on their sales of certain medical devices, which is suspended from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2019, and, absent further legislative action, will be reinstated starting January 1, 2020;\n\u2022\nrequires collection of rebates for drugs paid by Medicaid managed care organizations;\n\u2022\naddresses new methodologies by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, and for drugs that are line extension products;\n\u2022\nrequires manufacturers to participate in a coverage gap discount program, under which they must agree to offer point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer\u2019s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; and\n\u2022\nexpands eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing a manufacturer\u2019s Medicaid rebate liability.\nSince its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. As a result, there have been delays in the implementation of, and action taken to repeal or replace, certain aspects of the ACA. We expect that the current administration and U.S. Congress may continue to seek to modify, repeal, or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of, the ACA. We cannot predict the ultimate content, timing or effect of any healthcare reform legislation or the impact of potential legislation on us.\nOther legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. These changes included aggregated reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013, and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will remain in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. On January 2, 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Recently, there has also been heightened\ngovernmental scrutiny over the manner in which drug manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products once approved or additional pricing pressures.\nIn the EU, similar political, economic and regulatory developments may affect our ability to profitably commercialize our product and product candidates, if approved. In addition to continuing pressure on prices and cost containment measures, legislative developments at the EU or member state level may result in significant additional requirements or obstacles that may increase our operating costs. The delivery of healthcare in the EU, including the establishment and operation of health services and the pricing and reimbursement of medicines, is almost exclusively a matter for national, rather than EU, law and policy. National governments and health service providers have different priorities and approaches to the delivery of health care and the pricing and reimbursement of products in that context. In general, however, the healthcare budgetary constraints in most EU member states have resulted in restrictions on the pricing and reimbursement of medicines by relevant health service providers. Coupled with ever-increasing EU and national regulatory burdens on those wishing to develop and market products, this could prevent or delay marketing approval of our product and product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to commercialize our product and product candidates, if approved.\nIn markets outside of the United States and EU, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country, and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies.\nWe expect that additional foreign, federal and state healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that governmental programs will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products once approved or additional pricing pressures.\nWe are subject to healthcare laws, regulation and enforcement and our failure to comply with those laws could adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition.\nEven though we do not and will not control referrals of healthcare services or bill directly to Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors, certain U.S. federal and state healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse and patients\u2019 rights are and will be applicable to our business. We could be subject to healthcare fraud and abuse and patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The regulations that may affect our ability to operate include, without limitation:\n\u2022\nthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly and willfully offering, soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, for an item or service or the purchasing or ordering of a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;\n\u2022\nfederal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the federal False Claims Act, which prohibits, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false claims, or knowingly using false statements, to obtain payment from the federal government, and which may apply to entities that provide coding and billing advice to customers;\n\u2022\nfederal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;\n\u2022\nfederal civil monetary penalties laws, which impose civil fines for, among other things, the offering or transfer of remuneration to a Medicare or state healthcare program beneficiary if the person knows or should know it is likely to influence the beneficiary\u2019s selection of a particular provider, practitioner, or supplier of services reimbursable by Medicare or a state healthcare program, unless an exception applies;\n\u2022\nfederal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers;\n\u2022\nthe federal physician sunshine requirements under the ACA, which require manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians, other healthcare providers, and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and other healthcare providers and their immediate family members;\n\u2022\nthe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, which governs the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protects the security and privacy of protected health information;\n\u2022\nfederal price reporting laws, which require manufacturers to calculate and report complex pricing metrics to government programs, where such reported prices may be used in the calculation of reimbursement and/or discounts on approved products;\n\u2022\nstate law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures and pricing information; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts; and\n\u2022\nsimilar healthcare laws and regulations in the European Union and other jurisdictions, including reporting requirements detailing interactions with and payments to healthcare providers and requirements regarding the collection, distribution, use, security, and storage of personally identifiable information and other data relating to individuals (including the European Union enacted Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation)).\nBecause of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. In addition, healthcare reform legislation has strengthened these laws. For example, the ACA, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute and criminal healthcare fraud statutes. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the ACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act.\nAchieving and sustaining compliance with these laws may prove costly. In addition, any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal and other related expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental laws and regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, imprisonment, additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance, or the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock is extremely volatile and our stockholders may not be able to resell shares of our common stock at or above the price they paid.\nThe trading volume of our common stock on The Nasdaq Global Market has been limited since our IPO which occurred in March 2014, and there can be no assurance that an active and liquid trading market for our common stock will be sustained. We cannot predict the extent to which investor interest in our company will lead to an active trading market on The Nasdaq Global Market or otherwise or how liquid that market might become. If an active public market is not sustained, it may be difficult for stockholders to sell their shares of common stock at prices that are attractive to them, or at all. Further, an inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital by selling shares of our common stock and may impair our ability to enter into strategic partnerships or acquire companies or products, product candidates or technologies by using our shares of common stock as consideration. The trading price of our common stock is highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. Factors that could cause volatility in the market price of our common stock include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\ncommercial success and market acceptance of ZEMDRI or our product candidates following regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nresults from, or any delays in, clinical trial programs relating to ZEMDRI or our product candidates;\n\u2022\ndelays in commercializing or obtaining regulatory approvals for ZEMDRI or our product candidates;\n\u2022\nresults or announcements (if any) from, or any delays in, our evaluation of strategic alternatives for the Company focusing on enhancing stockholder value and the timing and nature of any strategic transactions that we undertake (if any);\n\u2022\nany need to suspend or discontinue clinical trials due to side effects or other safety risks, or any need to conduct studies on the long-term effects associated with the use of ZEMDRI or our product candidates;\n\u2022\ncapital fundraising or other financing activities that contain onerous or unfavorable terms;\n\u2022\nmanufacturing issues related to ZEMDRI or our product candidates for clinical trials or future products for commercialization;\n\u2022\nundesirable side effects caused by ZEMDRI or our product candidates after they have entered the market;\n\u2022\nspread of bacterial resistance to ZEMDRI or our product candidates;\n\u2022\nability to discover, develop and commercialize additional product candidates;\n\u2022\nannouncements relating to collaborations that we may enter into with respect to the development or commercialization of ZEMDRI or our product candidates, or the timing of payments we may make or receive under these arrangements;\n\u2022\nannouncements relating to the receipt, modification or termination of government contracts or grants, or the timing of payments we may receive under these arrangements;\n\u2022\nsuccess of our competitors in discovering, developing or commercializing products;\n\u2022\ndelay or failure to successfully develop, validate and obtain regulatory clearance or approval of plazomicin IVD assay or related diagnostic;\n\u2022\nstrategic transactions undertaken by us;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022\nproduct liability claims related to our clinical trials, ZEMDRI or product candidates;\n\u2022\nprevailing economic conditions;\n\u2022\nbusiness disruptions caused by earthquakes or other natural disasters;\n\u2022\ndisputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights;\n\u2022\nlitigation or the threat of litigation;\n\u2022\nFDA or other U.S. or foreign regulatory actions affecting us or our industry;\n\u2022\nhealthcare reform measures in the United States or other countries;\n\u2022\nsales of our common stock by our officers, directors or significant stockholders;\n\u2022\nfuture sales or issuances of equity or debt securities by us;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in our quarterly operating results; and\n\u2022\nthe issuance of new or changed securities analysts\u2019 reports or recommendations regarding us.\nIn addition, the stock markets in general, and the markets for pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology stocks in particular, have experienced extreme volatility that has been often unrelated to the operating performance of the issuer. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price or liquidity of our common stock. In the past, when the market price of a stock has been volatile, holders of that stock have sometimes instituted securities class action litigation against the issuer. If any of our stockholders were to bring such a lawsuit against us, we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit and the attention of our management would be diverted from the operation of our business, which could seriously harm our financial position. Any adverse determination in litigation could also subject us to significant liabilities.\nWe may not meet the continued listing standards of The Nasdaq Global Market, which requires a minimum closing bid price of $1.00 per share, which could result in our delisting and negatively impact the price of our common stock and our ability to access the capital markets.\nOur common stock is currently listed on The Nasdaq Global Market. Nasdaq provides various continued listing requirements that a company must meet in order for its stock to continue trading on The Nasdaq Global Market. Among these requirements is the requirement that the Company\u2019s stock trades at a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share. Our stock price first traded at below $1.00 on February 15, 2019 and has closed at a price less than $1.00 every trading day since that date. If our stock price closes with a bid price below $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive trading days, we would expect to receive a notice from Nasdaq providing us with 180 calendar days to regain compliance with the rule. After this 180 day period is up, if we still do not comply with the minimum $1.00 bid price we may be eligible for an additional 180 day period to regain compliance. However, if we fail to comply with the minimum stock price of $1.00 per share or any other continued listing standards of Nasdaq, including maintaining a minimum market value of listed securities of $35 million, or alternative standards under Nasdaq Listing Rules 5550(b)(1) and 5550(b)(3), our common stock may be delisted. If that were to occur, our stock would be subject to rules that impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell our securities. The additional burdens imposed upon broker-dealers by these requirements could discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our common stock. This would significantly affect the ability of investors to trade our securities and would significantly negatively affect the value and liquidity of our common stock. These factors could contribute to lower prices and larger spreads in the bid and ask prices for our common stock.\nWe are currently considering actions that we may take in order to regain compliance with continued listing requirements. For example, in order to regain compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s minimum bid price requirement, we may seek stockholder approval of a reverse stock split at our 2019 annual meeting of the stockholders, although there can be no assurance that stockholder approval will be obtained or that the reverse stock split will cure the issue. Also, the announcement and/or implementation of a reverse stock split could significantly negatively affect the price of our common stock.\nAlternatively, the Company may apply to transfer the listing of its common shares to the Nasdaq Capital Market if it satisfies all criteria for initial listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market, other than compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. If such application to the Nasdaq Capital Market is approved, then the Company may be eligible for an additional 180 day period to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. If our common stock is not eligible for quotation on another exchange, trading of our common stock could be conducted in the over-the-counter market or on an electronic bulletin board established for unlisted securities such as Pink Quote (formerly known as the Pink Sheets) or the OTC Bulletin Board. In such event, it could become more difficult to dispose of, or obtain accurate quotations for the price of our common stock, and there would likely also be a reduction in our coverage by security analysts and the news media, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline further.\nOur principal stockholders and management own a significant percentage of our stock and will be able to exert significant control over matters subject to stockholder approval.\nOur principal stockholders, including management, may continue to have significant influence over the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets or any other significant corporate transaction. The interests of these stockholders may not be the same as or may even conflict with your interests. For example, these stockholders could delay or prevent a change of control of our company, even if such a change of control would benefit our other stockholders, which could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of our company or our assets and might affect the prevailing market price of our common stock. The concentration of stock ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock due to investors\u2019 perception that conflicts of interest may exist or arise.\nRaising additional funds by issuing securities or through licensing or lending arrangements may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish proprietary rights.\nTo the extent that we continue to raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, the share ownership of existing stockholders will continue to be diluted. For example, on February 27, 2018, we filed an amended Registration Statement on Form S-3 (the \u201c2018 Shelf Registration Statement\u201d) covering the offering of up to $250.0 million of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants and units. In addition, on February 27, 2018, we filed a prospectus supplement to the 2018 Shelf Registration Statement covering the offering, issuance and sale of up to $50.0 million shares of our common stock in \u201cat the market\u201d (\u201cATM\u201d) offerings pursuant to a Common Stock Sales Agreement entered into with Cowen and Company, LLC (the \u201c2018 Sales Agreement\u201d). During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, we sold 3,089,358 shares of common stock under the 2018 Sales Agreement, at a weighted-average price of approximately $2.46 per share for aggregate gross proceeds of $7.6 million and net proceeds of $7.4 million. We have not sold any additional shares of common stock under the 2018 Sales Agreement since December 2018.\nMoreover, on February 20, 2019, we announced the completion of an underwritten public offering of 15,000,000 shares of our common stock and accompanying short-term warrants to purchase up to 15,000,000 shares of our common stock and long-term warrants to purchase up to 15,000,000 shares of our common stock. To the extent these warrants are exercised, the share ownership of existing stockholders may experience significant additional dilution.\nAny future debt financing may involve covenants that restrict our operations, including, among other restrictions, limitations on our ability to incur liens or additional debt, pay dividends, redeem our stock, make certain investments, and engage in certain merger, consolidation, or asset sale transactions. In addition, if we raise additional funds through licensing arrangements, it may be necessary to grant potentially valuable rights to our product candidates or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. Further, we may choose to raise additional capital due to market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans. To the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, including pursuant to the 2018 Shelf Registration Statement or the 2018 Sales Agreement, or the exercise of outstanding warrants to purchase shares of common stock, the issuance of these securities could result in further dilution to our stockholders or result in downward pressure on the price of our common stock.\nFuture sales by our existing holders of our common stock or securities convertible or exchangeable for our common stock may depress our stock price.\nIf our existing stockholders or holders of our options or warrants sell, or indicate an intention to sell, substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, the market price of our common stock could decline. In the first quarter of 2019, our largest shareholder has publicly disclosed repeated sales of our common stock and continued sales could impact our stock price. The perception in the market that any such sales may occur could also cause the trading price of our common stock to decline. As of March 25, 2019, we have outstanding a total of 63,879,995 shares of common stock. Other than any shares held by our directors, officers and certain existing investors, all of these are currently freely tradable.\nIn addition, based on the number of shares subject to outstanding awards under our Amended and Restated 2003 Stock Plan (our \u201c2003 Plan\u201d) or subject to outstanding awards or available for issuance under our 2014 Equity Incentive Award Plan (our \u201c2014 Plan\u201d), our 2014 Employment Commencement Incentive Plan (our \u201cInducement Plan\u201d) and our 2014 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (our \u201cESPP\u201d), in each case, as of March 25, 2019, 9,381,072 shares of common stock that are either subject to outstanding awards, outstanding but subject to vesting, or reserved for future issuance under our 2003 Plan, 2014 Plan, Inducement Plan or ESPP will become eligible for sale in the public market to the extent permitted by the provisions of various vesting schedules. We have filed registration statements permitting shares of common stock issued in the future pursuant to the 2003 Plan, 2014 Plan, Inducement Plan or ESPP to be freely resold by plan participants in the public market and, for shares held by directors, executive officers and other affiliates, subject to compliance with Rule 144. The 2014 Plan and ESPP also contain a provision for the annual increase of the number of shares reserved for issuance under such plan, which shares we also intend to register in the future as such annual increases occurs. If the shares we may issue from time to time under the 2003 Plan, 2014 Plan, the Inducement Plan or ESPP are sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold, by the award recipient in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nAs of March 25, 2019, certain holders of 1,746,461 shares of our common stock and warrants exercisable for 17,514 shares of our common stock are entitled to rights with respect to the registration of their shares under the Securities Act. Registration of these shares under the Securities Act would result in the shares becoming freely tradable without restriction under the Securities Act, except for shares purchased by affiliates. Sales of such shares could also cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.\nProvisions of our charter documents or Delaware law could delay or prevent an acquisition of our company, even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders, and could make it more difficult for you to change management.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempt by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult to replace or remove our board of directors. These provisions include:\n\u2022\na classified board of directors so that not all directors are elected at one time;\n\u2022\na prohibition on stockholder action through written consent;\n\u2022\nno cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n\u2022\nthe exclusive right of our board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director;\n\u2022\na requirement that special meetings of stockholders be called only by the board of directors, the chairman of the board of directors, the chief executive officer or, in the absence of a chief executive officer, the president;\n\u2022\nan advance notice requirement for stockholder proposals and nominations;\n\u2022\ndirectors may not be removed without cause and may only be removed with cause by the affirmative vote of 66 2/3% of all outstanding shares of our capital stock with the power to vote in the election of directors;\n\u2022\nthe authority of our board of directors to issue preferred stock with such terms as our board of directors may determine; and\n\u2022\na requirement of approval of not less than 66 2/3% of all outstanding shares of our capital stock with the power to vote to amend any bylaws by stockholder action, or to amend specific provisions of our certificate of incorporation.\nIn addition, Delaware law prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder, generally a person who, together with its affiliates, owns or within the last three years has owned 15% or more of our voting stock, for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. Accordingly, Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company. Furthermore, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation specifies that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for most legal actions involving actions brought against us by stockholders. We believe this provision benefits us by providing increased consistency in the application of Delaware law by chancellors particularly experienced in resolving corporate disputes, efficient administration of cases on a more expedited schedule relative to other forums and protection against the burdens of multi-forum litigation. However, the provision may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors and officers. The enforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies\u2019 certificates of incorporation has been challenged in legal proceedings, and it is possible that, in connection with any applicable action brought against us, a court could find the choice of forum provisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in such action.\nProvisions in our charter and other provisions of Delaware law could limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.\nWe do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future; as a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business. In addition, the terms of any future debt financing arrangement may contain terms prohibiting or limiting the amount of dividends that may be declared or paid on our common stock. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research, about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend, in part, on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. In addition, if our operating results fail to meet the forecast of analysts, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which might cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.", "PERMNO": 14530, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "AKAOQ"}
