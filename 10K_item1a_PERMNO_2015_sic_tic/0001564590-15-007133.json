{"cik": "1308161", "company": "TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY FOX, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-08-13", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nProspective investors should consider carefully the risk factors set forth below before making an investment in the Company\u2019s securities.\nThe Company Must Respond to Changes in Consumer Behavior as a Result of New Technologies in Order to Remain Competitive.\nTechnology, particularly digital technology used in the entertainment industry, continues to evolve rapidly, leading to alternative methods for the delivery and storage of digital content. These technological advancements have driven changes in consumer behavior and have empowered consumers to seek more control over when, where and how they consume digital content. Content owners are increasingly delivering their content directly to consumers over the Internet and innovations in distribution platforms have enabled consumers to view such Internet-delivered content on televisions and portable devices. The growth of direct to consumer video offerings, including video on demand offerings, as well as offerings by cable providers of smaller packages of programming to customers at price points lower than traditional cable distribution offerings could adversely affect demand for our cable channels. There is a risk that the Company\u2019s responses to these changes and strategies to remain competitive, or failure to effectively anticipate or adapt to new market changes, could adversely affect our business. In addition, enhanced Internet capabilities and other new media may reduce television viewership, the demand for DVDs and Blu-rays and the desire to see motion pictures in theaters, which could negatively affect the Company\u2019s revenues. The Company\u2019s failure to protect and exploit the value of its content, while responding to and developing new technology and business models to take advantage of advancements in technology and the latest consumer preferences, could have a significant adverse effect on the Company\u2019s businesses, asset values and results of operations.\nAcceptance of the Company\u2019s Films and Television Programming by the Public is Difficult to Predict, Which Could Lead to Fluctuations in Revenues.\nFeature film and television production and distribution are speculative businesses since the revenues derived from the production and distribution of a feature film or television series depend primarily upon its acceptance by the public, which is difficult to predict. The commercial success of a feature film or television series also depends upon the quality and acceptance of other competing films and television series released into the marketplace at or near the same time, the availability of a growing number of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure time activities, general economic conditions and their effects on consumer spending and other tangible and intangible factors, all of which can change and cannot be predicted with certainty. Further, the theatrical success of a feature film and the audience ratings for a television series are generally key factors in generating revenues from other distribution channels, such as home entertainment and premium pay television, with respect to feature films, and syndication, with respect to television series.\nThe Inability to Renew Sports Programming Rights Could Cause the Company\u2019s Affiliate and Advertising Revenue to Decline Significantly in any Given Period or in Specific Markets.\nThe sports rights contracts between the Company, on the one hand, and various professional sports leagues and teams, on the other, have varying duration and renewal terms. As these contracts expire, renewals on favorable terms may be sought; however, third parties may outbid the current rights holders for the rights contracts. In\naddition, professional sports leagues or teams may create their own networks or the renewal costs could substantially exceed the original contract cost. The loss of rights could impact the extent of the sports coverage offered by the Company and its affiliates, as it relates to FOX, and could adversely affect the Company\u2019s advertising and affiliate revenues. Upon renewal, the Company\u2019s results could be adversely affected if escalations in sports programming rights costs are unmatched by increases in advertising rates and, in the case of cable networks, subscriber fees.\nA Decline in Advertising Expenditures Could Cause the Company\u2019s Revenues and Operating Results to Decline Significantly in any Given Period or in Specific Markets.\nThe Company derives substantial revenues from the sale of advertising on or in its television stations, broadcast and cable networks and direct broadcast satellite services. Expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical, reflecting overall economic conditions, as well as budgeting and buying patterns. A decline in the economic prospects of advertisers or the economy in general could alter current or prospective advertisers\u2019 spending priorities. Demand for the Company\u2019s products is also a factor in determining advertising rates. For example, ratings points for the Company\u2019s television stations and broadcast and cable networks are factors that are weighed when determining advertising rates, and with respect to the Company\u2019s television stations and broadcast and television networks, when determining the affiliate rates received by the Company. In addition, newer technologies, including new video formats, streaming and downloading capabilities via the Internet, video-on-demand, personal video recorders and other devices and technologies are increasing the number of media and entertainment choices available to audiences. Some of these devices and technologies allow users to view television or motion pictures from a remote location or on a time-delayed basis and provide users the ability to fast-forward, rewind, pause and skip programming and advertisements. These technological developments which are increasing the number of media and entertainment choices available to audiences could negatively impact not only consumer demand for our content and services but also could affect the attractiveness of the Company\u2019s offerings to viewers, advertisers and/or distributors. Failure to effectively anticipate or adapt to emerging technologies or changes in consumer behavior could have an adverse effect on our business. Further, a decrease in advertising expenditures, reduced demand for the Company\u2019s offerings or the inability to obtain market ratings that adequately measure demand for the Company\u2019s content on personal video recorders and mobile devices could lead to a reduction in pricing and advertising spending, which could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s businesses and assets.\nThe Loss of Carriage Agreements Could Cause the Company\u2019s Revenue and Operating Results to Decline Significantly in any Given Period or in Specific Markets.\nThe Company\u2019s broadcast stations and cable networks maintain affiliation and carriage arrangements that enable them to reach a large percentage of cable and direct broadcast satellite households across the United States. The loss of a significant number of these arrangements or the loss of carriage on basic programming tiers could reduce the distribution of the Company\u2019s broadcast stations and cable networks, which may adversely affect those networks\u2019 revenues from subscriber fees and their ability to sell national and local advertising time. The Company is dependent upon the maintenance of affiliation agreements with third party owned television stations and there can be no assurance that these affiliation agreements will be renewed in the future on terms acceptable to the Company. The loss of a significant number of these affiliation arrangements could reduce the distribution of FOX and MyNetworkTV and adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to sell national advertising time.\nThe Company Relies on Network and Information Systems and Other Technology Whose Failure or Misuse, Could Cause a Disruption of Services or Improper Disclosure of Personal Data, Business Information, Including Intellectual Property, or Other Confidential Information, Resulting in Increased Costs or Loss of Revenue.\nNetwork and information systems and other technologies, including those related to the Company\u2019s network management, are important to its business activities. Network and information systems-related events, such as computer hackings, theft, computer viruses, worms or other destructive or disruptive software, process breakdowns, denial of service attacks, malicious social engineering or other malicious activities, or any combination of the foregoing, as well as power outages, natural disasters (including extreme weather), terrorist activities or human error that may affect such systems, could result in disruption of our services or improper disclosure of personal data, business information, including intellectual property, or other confidential information. In recent years, there has been a rise in the number of sophisticated cyber attacks on network and information systems, and as a result, the risks associated with such an event continue to increase. The Company has experienced, and expects to continue to be subject to, cybersecurity threats and incidents, none of which has been material to the Company to date. While\nwe continue to develop, implement and maintain security measures seeking to prevent unauthorized access to or misuse of our network and information systems, such efforts may not be successful in preventing these events from occurring given that the techniques used to access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently. The development and maintenance of these measures is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. Significant security breaches, such as misappropriation, misuse, leakage, falsification, accidental release, or otherwise improper disclosure of information maintained in the Company\u2019s information systems and networks or those of our vendors, including financial, personal, confidential and proprietary information relating to personnel, customers, vendors and our business, including our intellectual property, could result in a disruption of our operations, customer or advertiser dissatisfaction, damage to our reputation or brands, regulatory investigations, lawsuits or loss of customers or revenue. In addition the Company may be subject to liability under relevant contractual obligations and laws and regulations protecting personal data and privacy, and may require us to expend significant resources to remedy any such security breach.\nTechnological Developments May Increase the Threat of Content Piracy and Signal Theft and Limit the Company\u2019s Ability to Protect Its Intellectual Property Rights.\nContent piracy and signal theft present a threat to the Company\u2019s revenues from products and services, including, but not limited to, films, television shows, cable and other programming. The Company seeks to limit the threat of content piracy and direct broadcast satellite programming signal theft; however, policing unauthorized use of the Company\u2019s products and services and related intellectual property is often difficult and the steps taken by the Company may not in every case prevent the infringement by unauthorized third parties. Developments in technology, including digital copying, file compressing and the growing penetration of high-bandwidth Internet connections, increase the threat of content piracy by making it easier to duplicate and widely distribute high-quality pirated material. In addition, developments in software or devices that circumvent encryption technology and the falling prices of devices incorporating such technologies increase the threat of unauthorized use and distribution of direct broadcast satellite programming signals and the proliferation of user-generated content sites and live and stored video streaming sites, which deliver unauthorized copies of copyrighted content, including those emanating from other countries in various languages, may adversely impact the Company\u2019s businesses. The proliferation of unauthorized distribution and use of the Company\u2019s content could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s businesses and profitability because it reduces the revenue that the Company could potentially receive from the legitimate sale and distribution of its products and services.\nThe Company has taken, and will continue to take, a variety of actions to combat piracy and signal theft, both individually and, in some instances, together with industry associations. However, protection of the Company\u2019s intellectual property rights is dependent on the scope and duration of the Company\u2019s rights as defined by applicable laws in the United States and abroad and the manner in which those laws are construed. If those laws are drafted or interpreted in ways that limit the extent or duration of the Company\u2019s rights, or if existing laws are changed, the Company\u2019s ability to generate revenue from intellectual property may decrease, or the cost of obtaining and enforcing our rights may increase. There can be no assurance that the Company\u2019s efforts to enforce its rights and protect its products, services and intellectual property will be successful in preventing content piracy or signal theft. Further, while piracy and technology tools continue to escalate, if any U.S. or international laws intended to combat piracy and protect intellectual property are repealed or weakened or not adequately enforced, or if the legal system fails to evolve and adapt to new technologies that facilitate piracy, we may be unable to effectively protect our rights and the value of our intellectual property may be negatively impacted and our costs of enforcing our rights could increase.\nFluctuations in Foreign Exchange Rates Could Have an Adverse Effect on the Company\u2019s Results of Operations.\nThe Company has significant operations in a number of foreign jurisdictions and certain of the Company operations are conducted in foreign currencies. The value of these currencies fluctuates relative to the U.S. dollar. For example, in fiscal 2015, the U.S. dollar appreciated in relation to the Euro, the Canadian dollar, the Mexican Peso and the Brazilian Real. As a result, the Company is exposed to exchange rate fluctuations, which could have an adverse effect on its results of operations in a given period or in specific markets. Even though the Company uses foreign currency derivative instruments to hedge certain exposures to foreign currency exchange rate risks, the use of such derivative instruments may not be effective in reducing the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates.\nFor example, our business activities in Venezuela operate in a highly inflationary economy. In February 2015, the Venezuelan government introduced a new foreign currency exchange system called the Marginal Currency System (\u201cSIMADI\u201d). Accordingly, the Company has remeasured all its Venezuelan Bolivar denominated net monetary assets at the devalued SIMADI exchange rate. The Company had previously used the Supplementary Foreign Currency Administration System (\u201cSICAD 2\u201d) rate. During fiscal 2014 and 2015, we remeasured all our Bolivar denominated net monetary assets at the SICAD 2 and SIMADI exchange rates, respectively, resulting in devaluation losses (See Note 22 - Additional Financial Information to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements of Twenty-First Century Fox for further discussion). The Venezuelan government may issue more regulations or take other steps that might introduce significant uncertainty regarding the exchange rate that we can access to convert our Venezuelan Bolivar denominated monetary assets to U.S. dollars. Such measures can also affect our decision on which exchange rate(s) to use for financial reporting purposes. In addition, other countries where we have operations, including in Latin America, may be determined in the future to be highly inflationary economies, requiring special accounting and financial reporting treatment for such operations.\nLabor Disputes May Have an Adverse Effect on the Company\u2019s Business.\nIn a variety of the Company\u2019s businesses, the Company and its partners engage the services of writers, directors, actors and other talent, trade employees and others who are subject to collective bargaining agreements, including employees of the Company\u2019s film and television studio operations. If the Company or its partners are unable to renew expiring collective bargaining agreements, it is possible that the affected unions could take action in the form of strikes or work stoppages. Such actions, as well as higher costs in connection with these collective bargaining agreements or a significant labor dispute, could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business by causing delays in production or by reducing profit margins.\nChanges in U.S. or Foreign Regulations May Have an Adverse Effect on the Company\u2019s Business.\nThe Company is subject to a variety of U.S. and foreign regulations in the jurisdictions in which its businesses operate. In general, the television broadcasting and multichannel video programming and distribution industries in the United States are highly regulated by federal laws and regulations issued and administered by various federal agencies, including the FCC. The FCC generally regulates, among other things, the ownership of media, broadcast and multichannel video programming and technical operations of broadcast licensees. Our program services and online properties are subject to a variety of laws and regulations, including those relating to issues such as content regulation, user privacy and data protection, and consumer protection, among others. Further, the United States Congress, the FCC and state legislatures currently have under consideration, and may in the future adopt, new laws, regulations and policies regarding a wide variety of matters, including technological changes and measures relating to privacy and data security, which could, directly or indirectly, affect the operations and ownership of the Company\u2019s U.S. media properties. Similarly, new laws or regulations or changes in interpretations of law or in regulations imposed by governments in other jurisdictions in which the Company, or entities in which the Company has an interest, operate could require changes in the operations or ownership of our media properties. In addition, laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions which regulate, among other things, licensing arrangements, local content requirements, carriage requirements regarding pricing and distribution, and limitations on advertising time, may impact the operations and results of our international businesses.\nIn addition, changes in tax laws, regulations or the interpretations thereof in the U.S. and other jurisdictions in which the Company has operations could affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nU.S. Citizenship Requirements May Limit Common Stock Ownership and Voting Rights.\nThe Company owns broadcast station licensees in connection with its ownership and operation of U.S. television stations. Under U.S. law, no broadcast station licensee may be owned by a corporation if more than 25% of its stock is owned or voted by non-U.S. persons, their representatives, or by any other corporation organized under the laws of a foreign country. The Company\u2019s Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the Board of Directors to prevent, cure or mitigate the effect of stock ownership above the applicable foreign ownership threshold by taking any action including: refusing to permit any transfer of common stock to or ownership of common stock by a non-U.S. stockholder; voiding a transfer of common stock to a non-U.S. stockholder; suspending rights of stock ownership if held by a non-U.S. stockholder; or redeeming common stock held by a non-U.S. stockholder. In order to maintain compliance with U.S. law, the suspension of voting rights of the Class B Common Stock held by non-\nU.S. stockholders is currently at 10%. This suspension will remain in place for as long as the Company deems it necessary to maintain compliance with applicable U.S. law, and may be adjusted by the Audit Committee as it deems appropriate. The Company is not able to predict whether it will need to adjust the suspension or whether additional action pursuant to its Restated Certificate of Incorporation may be necessary. The FCC could review the Company\u2019s compliance with applicable U.S. law in connection with its consideration of the Company\u2019s renewal applications for licenses to operate the broadcast stations the Company owns.\nThe Company is exposed to risks associated with weak domestic and global economic conditions and increased volatility and disruption in the financial markets.\nThe Company\u2019s businesses, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by weak domestic and global economic conditions. Factors that affect economic conditions include the rate of unemployment, the level of consumer confidence and changes in consumer spending habits. The Company also faces risks, including currency volatility and the stability of global local economies, associated with the impact of weak domestic and global economic conditions on advertisers, affiliates, suppliers, wholesale distributors, retailers, insurers, theater operators and others with which it does business.\nIncreased volatility and disruptions in the financial markets could make it more difficult and more expensive for the Company to refinance outstanding indebtedness and obtain new financing. Disruptions in the financial markets can also adversely affect the Company\u2019s lenders, insurers, customers and counterparties, including vendors, retailers and film co-financing partners. For instance, the inability of the Company\u2019s counterparties to obtain capital on acceptable terms could impair their ability to perform under their agreements with the Company and lead to negative effects on the Company, including business disruptions, decreased revenues and increases in bad debt expenses.\nThe Company Could Suffer Losses Due to Asset Impairment Charges for Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Programming.\nIn accordance with applicable generally accepted accounting principles, the Company performs an annual impairment assessment of its recorded goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including FCC licenses, during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. The Company also continually evaluates whether current factors or indicators, such as the prevailing conditions in the capital markets, require the performance of an interim impairment assessment of those assets, as well as other investments and other long-lived assets. Any significant shortfall, now or in the future, in advertising revenue and/or the expected popularity of the programming for which the Company has acquired rights could lead to a downward revision in the fair value of certain reporting units. A downward revision in the fair value of a reporting unit, indefinite-lived intangible assets, investments or long-lived assets could result in an impairment and a non-cash charge would be required. Any such charge could be material to the Company\u2019s reported net earnings.\nRisks Related to the Separation\nIf the Separation, Together with Certain Related Transactions, Were Ultimately Determined to be Taxable Transactions for U.S. Federal Income Tax Purposes, then We Could Be Subject to Significant Tax Liability.\nThe Company received (i) a private letter ruling from the IRS substantially to the effect that, among other things, the distribution of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock of News Corp qualifies as tax-free under Sections 368 and 355 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d) except for cash received in lieu of fractional shares of News Corp stock and (ii) an opinion from the law firm of Hogan Lovells US LLP confirming the tax-free status of the distribution for U.S. federal income tax purposes, including confirming the satisfaction of the requirements under Section 368 and 355 of the Code not specifically addressed in the IRS private letter ruling. The opinion of Hogan Lovells US LLP will not be binding on the IRS or the courts, and there is no assurance that the IRS or a court will not take a contrary position.\nThe private letter ruling and the opinion rely on certain facts and assumptions, and certain representations from the Company and News Corp regarding the past and future conduct of our respective businesses and other matters. Notwithstanding the receipt of the private letter ruling and the opinion, the IRS could determine on audit that the distribution or the internal transactions should be treated as taxable transactions if it determines that any of\nthese facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings is not correct or has been violated, or that the distribution or the internal transactions should be taxable for other reasons, including as a result of a significant change in stock or asset ownership after the distribution. If the distribution ultimately is determined to be taxable, the distribution could be treated as a taxable dividend or capital gain for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and U.S. stockholders and certain non-U.S. stockholders could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities. In addition, if the internal reorganization and/or the distribution is ultimately determined to be taxable, the Company would recognize gains on the internal reorganization and/or recognize gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of shares of the News Corp common stock distributed to our stockholders on the distribution date over our tax basis in such shares of our common stock.\nWe Could Be Liable for Income Taxes Owed by News Corp.\nEach member of our consolidated group, which until June 28, 2013 included News Corp and each of our other subsidiaries, is jointly and severally liable for the U.S. federal income tax liability of each other member of the consolidated group. Consequently, we could be liable in the event any such liability is incurred, and not discharged, by any other member of our consolidated group. Under the terms of the tax sharing and indemnification agreement that we entered into in connection with the Separation, we will be required to indemnify News Corp for any such liability. Disputes or assessments could arise during future audits by the IRS in amounts that we cannot quantify.\nCertain of Our Directors and Officers May Have Actual or Potential Conflicts of Interest Because of Their Equity Ownership in News Corp, and Certain of Our Officers and Directors May Have Actual or Potential Conflicts of Interest Because They Also Serve as Officers and/or on the Board of Directors of News Corp.\nCertain of our directors and executive officers own shares of News Corp\u2019s common stock, and the individual holdings may be significant for some of these individuals compared to their total assets. In addition, certain of our officers and directors also serve as officers and/or as directors of News Corp, including our Executive Chairmen K. Rupert Murdoch, who serves as News Corp\u2019s Executive Chairman, and Lachlan K. Murdoch, who serves as News Corp\u2019s Co-Chairman. This ownership or service to both companies may create, or may create the appearance of, conflicts of interest when these directors and officers are faced with decisions that could have different implications for News Corp and us. In addition to any other arrangements that the Company and News Corp may agree to implement, the Company and News Corp agreed that officers and directors who serve at both companies will recuse themselves from decisions where conflicts arise due to their positions at both companies.", "PERMNO": 90442, "SIC": 4888, "TIC": "TFCFA"}
