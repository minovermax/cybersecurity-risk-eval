{"cik": "1680378", "company": "SenesTech, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-31", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAs discussed under Item 1 of Part I, \u201cBusiness-Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d our actual results could differ materially from those expressed in our forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows and the trading price of our common stock could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to Commercialization of Our Product Candidates\nContraPest and our other product candidates, if approved, may not achieve adequate market acceptance necessary for commercial success.\nEven following receipt of any regulatory approval for ContraPest or any of our other product candidates, such products may not gain market acceptance. Market acceptance of any of our product candidates for which we receive approval depends on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022 The efficacy and safety of such product candidates as demonstrated in trials;\n\u2022 The uses, indications or limitations for which the product candidate is approved;\n\u2022 Acceptance of the product candidate as a safe and effective alternative;\n\u2022 The potential and perceived advantages of product candidates over alternative products;\n\u2022 Product labeling or product insert requirements of the EPA or other regulatory authorities;\n\u2022 The timing of market introduction of our products as well as future competitive products;\n\u2022 Relative convenience and ease of use;\n\u2022 The effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts and those of our collaborators; and\n\u2022 Unfavorable publicity relating to the product.\nIf any of our product candidates are approved but fail to achieve market acceptance, we will not be able to generate significant revenues, which would compromise our ability to become profitable. Furthermore, the commercial success of ContraPest will depend on a number of factors, including the following:\n\u2022 The development of a commercial organization or establishment of a commercial partnership with a commercial infrastructure;\n\u2022 Establishment of a commercially viable pricing;\n\u2022 Our ability to manufacture quantities of ContraPest using commercially acceptable processes and at a scale sufficient to meet anticipated demand and enable us to reduce our cost of manufacturing;\n\u2022 Our success in educating end users about the benefits, administration, and use of ContraPest;\n\u2022 The effectiveness of our own or our potential strategic partners\u2019 marketing, sales and distribution strategy, and operations; and\n\u2022 A continued acceptable safety profile of ContraPest following approval.\nMany of these factors are beyond our control. If we are unable to successfully commercialize ContraPest, we may not be able to earn sufficient revenues to continue our business.\nWe have never marketed a product before, and if we are unable to establish an effective sales force and marketing and distribution infrastructures, or enter into and rely upon acceptable third party relationships, we may be unable to generate any revenue.\nWe are developing but do not currently have an infrastructure for the sales, marketing, and distribution of our products and the cost of establishing and maintaining such an infrastructure may exceed the cost-effectiveness of doing so. In order to market ContraPest and any other products that may be approved by the EPA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, we must build our sales, marketing, managerial and other non-technical capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services for which we would incur substantial costs. If we are unable to establish adequate sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities, whether independently or with third parties, we may not be able to generate product revenue and may not become profitable. Without an internal commercial organization or the support of a third party to perform sales and marketing functions, we may be unable to compete successfully against more established companies.\nRisks Related to our Financial Condition and Capital Requirements\nWe have incurred significant operating losses every quarter since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur significant operating losses in the future.\nInvestment in product development is highly speculative because it entails substantial upfront capital expenditures and significant risk that any potential product candidate will fail to demonstrate adequate efficacy or an acceptable safety profile, gain regulatory approval, or become commercially viable. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through research grants as well as through the sale of equity securities and debt financings. Until August 2, 2016, we did not have any products approved by a regulatory authority for marketing or commercial sale, and we have not generated any revenue from product sales to date. We continue to incur significant research, development, and other expenses related to our ongoing operations. As a result, we are not profitable and have incurred losses in every reporting period since our inception. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we reported net losses of $11.0 million and $18.2 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit since inception of $61.3 million.\nSince inception, we have dedicated a majority of our resources to the discovery and development of our proprietary product candidates. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future. The size of our losses will depend, in part, on the rate of future expenditures and our ability to generate revenues. In particular, we expect to incur substantial and increased expenses as we:\n\u2022 Continue the research and development of ContraPest and our other product candidates, including engaging in any necessary field studies;\n\u2022 Seek regulatory approvals for ContraPest in various jurisdictions and for our other product candidates;\n\u2022 Scale up manufacturing processes and quantities to prepare for the commercialization of ContraPest and any other product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval;\n\u2022 Establish an infrastructure for the sales, marketing and distribution of ContraPest and any other product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval;\n\u2022 Attempt to achieve market acceptance for our products;\n\u2022 Expand our research and development activities and advance the discovery and development programs for other product candidates;\n\u2022 Maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; and\n\u2022 Add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our clinical development and commercialization efforts and operations as a public company.\nWe may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays, and other unknown factors that may adversely affect our financial condition. Our prior losses and expected future losses have had, and will continue to have, an adverse effect on our financial condition. If ContraPest or any other product candidate does not gain sufficient regulatory approval, or if approved, fails to achieve market acceptance, we may never become profitable. Even if we achieve profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods. Our failure to become and remain profitable would decrease the value of our company and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, diversify our product offerings or continue our operations. A decline in the value of our company could cause you to lose all or part of your investment.\nDepending on the commercial success of ContraPest, we may require additional capital to fund our operations. Failure to obtain this necessary capital if needed may force us to delay, limit, or terminate our product development efforts or other operations.\nDeveloping product candidates, including conducting experiments and field studies, obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval and commercializing any products later approved for sale, is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete. We expect our expenses to continue to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we advance our commercialization activities.\nBased upon our current operating plan, we expect that our cash and cash equivalents of approximately $11.8 million as of December 31, 2016, will be sufficient to fund our current operations for at least the next 12 months. However, we plan to substantially expand our operations, and as a result of many factors, some of which may be currently unknown to us, our expenses may be higher than expected.\nSecuring additional financing may divert our management from their day-to-day activities, which may adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates, including ContraPest. In addition, we cannot guarantee that future financing will be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when required or on acceptable terms, we may be required to:\n\u2022 Significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of our product candidates, including ContraPest;\n\u2022 Seek strategic partners for the manufacturing, sales and distribution of ContraPest or any of our other product candidates at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable or on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be available; and\n\u2022 Relinquish, or license on unfavorable terms, our rights to technologies or product candidates that we otherwise would seek to develop or commercialize ourselves.\nThe occurrence of any of the events described above would have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and prospects and on our ability to develop our product candidates.\nIf we are unable to continue as a going concern, our securities will have little or no value.\nWe have incurred operating losses since our inception, and we expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future. If we encounter significant issues or delays in the launch of ContraPest, these prior losses and expected future losses could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, negatively impact our ability to fund continued operations, our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and our ability to continue as a going concern. There are no assurances that such financing, if necessary, will be available to us at all or will be available in sufficient amounts or on reasonable terms. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Although we have raised additional capital since December 31, 2015 through private offerings of our equity securities and our initial public offering of 1,875,000 shares of our common stock in December, 2016, if we are unable to generate additional funds in the future through financings, sales of our products, licensing fees, royalty payments, or from other sources or transactions, we will exhaust our resources and will be unable to continue operations. If we cannot continue as a going concern, our stockholders would likely lose most or all of their investment in us.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations, or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or product candidates.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate sufficient product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs primarily through the sale of equity securities, debt financings, credit facilities and government and foundation grants. We may also seek to raise capital through third-party collaborations, strategic alliances and similar arrangements. We currently do not have any committed external source of funds. Raising funds in the future may present additional challenges and future financing may not be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. The terms of any financing arrangements we enter into may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders and the issuance of additional securities by us, or the possibility of such issuance, may cause the market price of our shares to decline. The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would dilute all of our stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness through credit facilities would result in increased fixed payment obligations and, potentially, the imposition of restrictive covenants. Those covenants may include limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends, and may impose limitations on our ability to acquire, sell, or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances, or licensing arrangements or other marketing or distribution arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates, or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to expand our operations or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or commercialization efforts, or grant others rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nRisks Relating to the Development and Regulatory Approval of Our Product Candidates\nOur future success is dependent on the regulatory approval and commercialization of ContraPest and any of our other product candidates.\nThe EPA granted registration approval for ContraPest effective August 2, 2016, but we must still obtain applicable state approval and will also seek regulatory approval in other jurisdictions. As a result, our near-term prospects, including our ability to finance our operations and generate revenue, are substantially dependent on our ability to obtain sufficient regulatory approval for ContraPest, and, if approved, to successfully commercialize ContraPest. We cannot commercialize our product candidates in the U.S. without first obtaining regulatory approval for each product and each use pattern from the EPA or, if applicable, the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and from any related applicable state authorities. Before obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of any product candidate for a target indication, the law requires that applicants demonstrate through laboratory and field studies and related data that the product candidate will perform its intended function without causing unreasonable adverse effects on the environment. The EPA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority may require more information, including additional data to support approval that may delay or prevent approval.\nRegulatory approval processes of the EPA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities are lengthy, time-consuming and unpredictable, and if we are ultimately unable to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, our business may fail.\nAlthough we obtained EPA approval for ContraPest in less than one year, the EPA review process for a product with one or more new active ingredients typically takes approximately two years to complete and approval is never guaranteed. Our other product candidates could fail to receive marketing approval from the EPA or, with respect to ContraPest or our other product candidates, from a comparable foreign regulatory authority for many reasons, including:\n\u2022 Disagreement over the design or implementation of our trials;\n\u2022 Failure to demonstrate a product candidate that is safe;\n\u2022 Failure to demonstrate a product candidate\u2019s benefits outweigh its risks;\n\u2022 Disagreement over our interpretation of data;\n\u2022 Disagreement over whether to accept efficacy results from trials;\n\u2022 The insufficiency of data collected from trials of ContraPest or our other product candidates to obtain regulatory approval;\n\u2022 Irreparable or critical compliance issues relating to our manufacturing process; or\n\u2022 Changes in the approval policies or regulations that render our data insufficient for approval.\nAny of these factors, some of which are beyond our control, could jeopardize our ability to obtain regulatory approval for and successfully market any of our product candidates. Any such setback in our pursuit of regulatory approval would have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects.\nEven following receipt of any regulatory approval for ContraPest and our other product candidates, we will continue to face extensive regulatory requirements and our products may face future development and regulatory difficulties.\nEven following receipt of any regulatory approval for ContraPest or our product candidates, such products will be subject to ongoing requirements by the EPA and comparable state and foreign regulatory authorities governing the manufacture, quality control, further development, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, safety surveillance, import, export, advertising, promotion, recordkeeping, and reporting of safety and other post-market information. The safety profile of any product will continue to be closely monitored by the EPA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities after approval. If the EPA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities become aware of new safety information after approval of ContraPest or any other product candidate, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:\n\u2022 We may be forced to suspend marketing of such product;\n\u2022 Regulatory authorities may withdraw their approvals of such product after certain procedural requirements have been met;\n\u2022 Regulatory authorities may require additional warnings on the label that could diminish the usage or otherwise limit the commercial success of such product;\n\u2022 The EPA or other regulatory bodies may issue safety alerts, press releases, or other communications containing warnings about such product;\n\u2022 The EPA may require the establishment or modification of restricted use or a comparable foreign regulatory authority may require the establishment or modification of a similar strategy that may, for instance, restrict distribution of our product and impose burdensome implementation requirements on us;\n\u2022 We may be required to change the way the product is administered or conduct additional trials;\n\u2022 We could be sued and held liable for harm caused;\n\u2022 We may be subject to litigation or product liability claims; and\n\u2022 Our reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the particular product candidate, if approved, and could significantly harm our business, results of operations and prospects.\nMoreover, existing government regulations may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit, or delay regulatory approval of ContraPest or any other product candidates. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained and/or be subject to fines or enhanced government oversight and reporting obligations, which would adversely affect our business, prospects, and ability to achieve or sustain profitability.\nEven following receipt of any regulatory approval for ContraPest and our other product candidates, we will continue to be subject to regulation of our manufacturing processes and advertising practices.\nManufacturers of pest control products are subject to continual government oversight and periodic inspections by the EPA and other regulatory authorities. If we or a regulatory agency discover problems with a facility where the product is manufactured, a regulatory agency may impose restrictions on the manufacturing facility, including requiring recall or withdrawal of the product from the market or suspension of manufacturing until certain procedural requirements have been met. The occurrence of any such event or penalty could limit our ability to market ContraPest or any other product candidates and generate revenue.\nIn addition, the EPA strictly regulates the advertising and promotion of pest control products, and these pest control products may only be marketed or promoted for their EPA approved uses, consistent with the product\u2019s approved labeling. Advertising and promotion of any product candidate that obtains approval in the U.S. will be heavily scrutinized by the EPA, other applicable state regulatory agencies and the public. Violations, including promotion of our products for unapproved or off-label uses, are subject to enforcement actions, inquiries and investigations, and civil, criminal and/or administrative sanctions imposed by the EPA.\nFailure to obtain regulatory approval in foreign jurisdictions would prevent ContraPest or any other product candidates from being marketed in those jurisdictions.\nTo market and sell our products globally, we must obtain separate marketing approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements. The approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing. The time required to obtain approval may differ substantially from that required to obtain EPA approval. Obtaining foreign regulatory approvals and maintaining compliance with foreign regulatory requirements could result in significant delays, difficulties, and cost for us and could delay or prevent the introduction of our products in certain countries. Approval by the EPA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions, but EPA approval may influence decisions by the foreign regulatory authority. If we are unable to obtain approval of ContraPest or for any of our other product candidates by regulatory authorities in the world market, the commercial prospects of that product candidate may be significantly diminished and our business prospects could decline.\nRisks Relating to Our Dependence on Third Parties\nWe do not currently have internal full-scale manufacturing capability and we must rely upon third parties to manufacture our products or develop our own full-scale manufacturing capability.\nOur existing internal manufacturing platform is adequate for meeting our current demand for ContraPest, and is being expanded to meet further anticipated demand. We may be required to spend significant time and resources to expand these manufacturing facilities to fully meet demand. If we are unable to develop our own full-scale manufacturing capabilities, we may not be able to meet demand of our products, and our business plan could fail.\nIf a current or future strategic partner terminates or fails to perform its obligations under an agreement with us, the development and commercialization of our product candidates could be delayed or terminated.\nWe are currently party to various production, marketing and distribution arrangements, including strategic partnership agreements with Bioceres and NeoVenta. Partnership agreements may not lead to development or commercialization of product candidates in the most efficient manner, or at all. If our partners do not devote sufficient time and resources to their strategic arrangement with us, we may not realize the potential commercial benefits of the arrangement, and our results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nMuch of the potential revenue from our current and future strategic partnerships may consist of contingent payments, such as payments for achieving regulatory milestones or royalties payable on sales of our products. The milestone and royalty revenue that we may receive under these partnerships will depend upon our partners\u2019 ability and willingness to successfully develop, introduce, market and sell ContraPest and any other product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval. Our partners may fail to develop or effectively commercialize products using our products or technologies because they:\n\u2022 Decide not to devote the necessary resources due to internal constraints, such as limited personnel with the requisite expertise, limited cash resources or specialized equipment limitations, or the belief that other development programs may have a higher likelihood of obtaining marketing approval or may potentially generate a greater return on investment;\n\u2022 Decide to pursue other technologies or develop other product candidates, either on their own or in collaboration with others, including our competitors, to treat the same problems targeted by our own products;\n\u2022 Do not have sufficient resources necessary to carry the product candidate through development, marketing approval and commercialization; or\n\u2022 Cannot obtain the necessary regulatory approvals.\nCompetition for our products and market forces in general may negatively impact any of our partners\u2019 focus on and commitment to our relationship and, as a result, could delay or otherwise negatively affect the commercialization of our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nWe face a number of challenges in seeking future strategic partnerships. Strategic partnerships are complex and any potential discussions may not result in a definitive agreement for many reasons. For example, whether we reach a definitive agreement for a future partnership will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the potential partner\u2019s resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed partnership, and the proposed partnership\u2019s evaluation of a number of factors, such as the design or results of our field studies, the potential market for our product candidates, the costs and complexities of manufacturing and delivering our product candidates to customers, the potential of competing products, the existence of uncertainty with respect to ownership or the coverage of our intellectual property, and industry and market conditions generally. If we determine that additional partnerships for our product candidates are necessary and are unable to enter into such partnerships on acceptable terms, we might elect to delay or scale back the development or commercialization of our product candidates in order to preserve our financial resources or to allow us adequate time to develop the required physical resources and systems and expertise ourselves.\nRisks Relating to Our Business Operations and Industry\nWe will need to expand our operations and grow the size of our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing this growth.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had 27 full-time and two part-time employees. As our development and commercialization plans and strategies develop, or as a result of any as yet unforeseen acquisitions, we will need additional managerial, operational, sales, marketing, scientific, financial headcount, and other resources. Our management, personnel, and systems currently in place may not be adequate to support this future growth. Future growth would impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including:\n\u2022 Managing our trials effectively, which we anticipate being conducted at numerous field study sites;\n\u2022 Identifying, recruiting, maintaining, motivating and integrating additional employees with the expertise and experience we will require;\n\u2022 Managing our internal development efforts effectively while complying with our contractual obligations to licensors, licensees, contractors and other third parties;\n\u2022 Managing additional relationships with various strategic partners, suppliers, and other third parties;\n\u2022 Improving our managerial, development, operational, marketing, production, and finance reporting systems and procedures; and\n\u2022 Expanding our facilities.\nOur failure to accomplish any of these tasks could prevent us from successfully growing our business.\nWe depend on key personnel to operate our business. If we are unable to retain, attract, and integrate qualified personnel, our ability to develop and successfully grow our business could be harmed.\nWe believe that our future success is highly dependent on the contributions of our significant employees, as well as our ability to attract and retain highly skilled and experienced sales, research and development, and other personnel in the U.S. and abroad. All of our employees, including our co-founders (one of which is also our chief executive officer), are free to terminate their employment relationship with us at any time, subject to any applicable notice requirements, and their knowledge of our business and industry would be difficult to replace. If one or more of our co-founders, executive officers or significant employees terminates his or her employment or becomes disabled or experiences long-term illness, we may not be able to replace their expertise, fully integrate new personnel or replicate the prior working relationships, and the loss of their services might significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our research, development and business objectives. Qualified individuals with the breadth of skills and experience in our industry that we require are in high demand, and we may incur significant costs to attract them. Many of the other companies that we compete against for qualified personnel have greater financial and other resources, different risk profiles, and a longer history in the industry than we do. They also may provide more diverse opportunities and better chances for career advancement. Additionally, our facilities are located in Arizona, which may make attracting and retaining qualified scientific and technical personnel from outside of Arizona difficult. Our failure to attract or retain key personnel could impede the achievement of our research, development, and commercialization objectives.\nWe have not fully assessed our internal control over financial reporting. We have previously identified and may in the future identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. If we are unable to remediate these material weaknesses, or if we experience additional material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately or timely report our financial condition or results of operations, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nIn connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015, we identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. We have addressed and resolved the issues identified in 2015.\nWe are in the process of implementing measures designed further to improve our internal control over financial reporting, including how to remediate the control deficiencies that led to our previously identified material weaknesses, including:\n\u00b7 the appointment of a Corporate Controller in May 2016;\n\u00b7 the establishment of formalized accounting policies and procedures and internal controls; and\n\u00b7 the implementation of manual and automated controls to support our overall control environment and the segregation of duties and procedures.\nWe have not been required to and have not filed an annual report for fiscal year 2016, so pursuant to SEC regulations, we are not yet required to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Similarly, because we are an emerging growth company, we are not required to include an auditor attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting in this annual report. As a result, we have not fully assessed our internal control over financial reporting and are unable to assure that the measures we have taken to date, together with any measures we may take in the future, will be sufficient to remediate the control deficiencies that led to our material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, or to avoid potential future material weaknesses.\nIf we are unable to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, successfully remediate any existing or future material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, or identify any additional material weaknesses, the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting may be adversely affected, we may be unable to maintain compliance with securities law requirements regarding timely filing of periodic reports in addition to Nasdaq listing requirements, investors may lose confidence in our financial reporting, and our stock price may decline as a result.\nWe may be subject to legal proceedings in the ordinary course of our business that could result in significant harm to our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe could be subject to legal proceedings and claims from time to time in the ordinary course of our business, including actions arising from tort, contract or other claims. Litigation is expensive, time consuming, and could divert management\u2019s attention away from running our business. The outcome of litigation or other proceedings is subject to significant uncertainty, and it is possible that an adverse resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in reputational harm and/or significant monetary damages, injunctive relief or settlement costs that could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition as well as our ability to conduct our business as it is presently being conducted. Insurance might not cover such claims, might not provide sufficient payments to cover all the costs to resolve one or more such claims, and might not be available on terms acceptable to us. In addition, regardless of merit or outcome, claims brought against us that are uninsured or underinsured could result in unanticipated costs, which could harm our business, financial condition and operating results and reduce the trading price of our stock.\nProduct liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to limit commercialization of any products that we may develop.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the use of ContraPest and any of our other products. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims from our product users, we could incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u2022 Decreased demand for any product that we may develop;\n\u2022 Termination of field studies or other research and development efforts;\n\u2022 Injury to our reputation and significant negative media attention;\n\u2022 Significant costs to defend the related litigation;\n\u2022 Substantial monetary awards to plaintiffs;\n\u2022 Loss of revenue;\n\u2022 Diversion of management and scientific resources from our business operations; and\n\u2022 The inability to commercialize our product candidates.\nWe may be unable to obtain commercially reasonable product liability insurance for any products approved for marketing. Large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on products that had unanticipated side effects, including, without limitation, any potential adverse effects of our products on humans or other species. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us, particularly if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could decrease our cash and adversely affect our business.\nBusiness disruptions, including supply-chain disruptions, could seriously harm our future revenues and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses.\nOur operations could be subject to a variety of potential business disruptions, including power shortages, telecommunications failures, water shortages, floods, fires, earthquakes, extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics and other natural or man-made disasters or other interruptions, for which we are predominantly self-insured. We do not carry insurance for all categories of risk that our business may encounter. The occurrence of any of these business disruptions could seriously harm our operations and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses. Moreover, we rely on various third parties to supply various ingredients and other items which are critical for producing our product candidates. Our ability to produce our product candidates would be disrupted if the operations of these suppliers are affected by a man-made or natural disaster or other business interruption. The ultimate impact on our operations from any business interruption impacting us or any of our significant suppliers is unknown, but our operations and financial condition would likely suffer adverse consequences. Further, any significant uninsured liability may require us to pay substantial amounts, which would adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows from future prospects.\nWe are dependent on a key ingredient for ContraPest, triptolide, which has limited sources and must be in a very refined condition.\nIf we are unable to develop additional sources of triptolide, which is one of the key ingredients for ContraPest, the long term ability to produce ContraPest at a cost effective price could be in jeopardy; the limited sources could restrict our production if supplies were reduced; another use of the ingredient could cause the price to increase beyond our ability to market at a competitive price; and increased demand for the ingredient could cause the quality of the refined ingredient to be less than needed for our production.\nA variety of risks associated with marketing our product candidates internationally could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe plan to seek regulatory approval of our product candidates outside of the U.S. and, accordingly, we expect that we will be subject to additional risks related to operating in foreign countries if we obtain the necessary approvals, including:\n\u2022 Differing regulatory requirements in foreign countries;\n\u2022 Unexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers, price and exchange controls and other regulatory requirements;\n\u2022 Economic weakness, including inflation or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets;\n\u2022 Compliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad;\n\u2022 Foreign taxes, including withholding of payroll taxes;\n\u2022 Foreign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenue, and other obligations incident to doing business in another country;\n\u2022 Difficulties staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022 Workforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States;\n\u2022 Potential liability under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, or the FCPA, or comparable foreign regulations;\n\u2022 Challenges enforcing our contractual and intellectual property rights, especially in those foreign countries that do not respect and protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the United States;\n\u2022 Production shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad; and\n\u2022 Business interruptions resulting from geo-political actions, including war and terrorism.\nThese and other risks associated with our international operations may materially adversely affect our ability to attain or maintain profitable operations.\nWe are subject to anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws with respect to our operations and non-compliance with such laws can subject us to criminal and/or civil liability and harm our business.\nWe are subject to the FCPA, which is the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7201, the U.S. Travel Act, the USA PATRIOT Act and possibly other anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws in countries in which we conduct activities. Anti-corruption laws are interpreted broadly and prohibit companies and their employees and third-party intermediaries from authorizing, offering or providing, directly or indirectly, improper payments or benefits to recipients in the public or private sector. As we commercialize our product candidates and eventually commence international sales and business, we may engage with collaborators and third-party intermediaries to sell our products abroad and to obtain necessary permits, licenses and other regulatory approvals. We or our third-party intermediaries may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities. We can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party intermediaries, our employees, representatives, contractors, partners and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities.\nNoncompliance with anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws could subject us to whistleblower complaints, investigations, sanctions, settlements, prosecution, other enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, significant fines, damages, other civil and criminal penalties or injunctions, suspension and/or debarment from contracting with certain persons, the loss of export privileges, reputational harm, adverse media coverage and other collateral consequences. Responding to any action will likely result in a materially significant diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources and significant defense costs and other professional fees.\nRisks Related to Protecting Our Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to obtain or protect intellectual property rights, our competitive position could be harmed.\nWe depend on our ability to protect our proprietary technology. We rely on trade secret, patent, copyright and trademark laws, and confidentiality, licensing, and other agreements with employees and third parties, all of which offer only limited protection. Our commercial success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection in the United States and other countries with respect to our proprietary technology and products. Where we deem appropriate, we seek to protect our proprietary position by filing patent applications in the U.S. and abroad related to our novel technologies and products that are important to our business. Patent positions of companies generally are highly uncertain, involve complex legal and factual questions and have, in recent years, been the subject of much litigation. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability, and commercial value of our patents, including those patent rights licensed to us by third parties, are highly uncertain.\nThe steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to preclude misappropriation of our proprietary information or infringement of our intellectual property rights, both inside and outside the U.S. The rights already granted under any of our currently issued patents and those that may be granted under future issued patents may not provide us with the proprietary protection or competitive advantages we are seeking. If we are unable to obtain and maintain protection for our technology and products, or if the scope of the protection obtained is not sufficient, our competitors could develop and commercialize technology and products similar or superior to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our technology and products may be adversely affected.\nWith respect to patent rights, we do not know whether any of our pending patent applications for any of our technologies or products will result in the issuance of patents that protect such technologies or products, or if our licensed patent will effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. Our pending patent applications cannot be enforced against third parties practicing the technology claimed in such applications unless and until a patent issues from such applications. Further, the examination process may require us to narrow the claims for our pending patent applications, which may limit the scope of patent protection that may be obtained if these applications issue. Because the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity, or enforceability, issued patents that we own or have licensed from third parties may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the U.S. and abroad. Such challenges may result in the loss of patent protection, the narrowing of claims in such patents, or the invalidity or unenforceability of such patents, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection for our technology and products. Protecting against the unauthorized use of our patented technology, trademarks, and other intellectual property rights, is expensive, difficult, and in some cases, may not be possible. In some cases, it may be difficult or impossible to detect third-party infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights, even in relation to issued patent claims, and proving any such infringement may be even more difficult.\nIntellectual property rights do not necessarily address all potential threats to any competitive advantage we may have.\nThe degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations, and may not adequately protect our business, or permit us to maintain our competitive advantage. The following examples are illustrative:\n\u2022 Others may be able to make compounds that are the same as or similar to our future products but that are not covered by the claims of the patents that we own or have exclusively licensed;\n\u2022 We or any of our licensors or strategic partners might not have been the first to file patent applications covering certain of our inventions;\n\u2022 Others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies without infringing on our intellectual property rights;\n\u2022 Issued patents that we own or have exclusively licensed may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or may be held invalid or unenforceable, as a result of legal challenges by our competitors;\n\u2022 Our competitors might conduct research and development activities in the U.S. and other countries that provide a safe harbor from patent infringement claims for certain research and development activities, as well as in countries where we do not have patent rights and then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in our major commercial markets;\n\u2022 We may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable; and\n\u2022 The patents of others may have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur technology may be found to infringe third-party intellectual property rights.\nThird parties may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to their patent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights in technology that is important to us. The asserted claims and/or litigation could include claims against us, our licensors, or our suppliers alleging infringement of intellectual property rights with respect to our product candidates or components of those products. Regardless of the merit of the claims, they could be time consuming, resulting in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel, or require us to develop non-infringing technology or enter into license agreements. We cannot assure you that licenses will be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Furthermore, because of the potential for significant damage awards, which are not necessarily predicable, it is not unusual to find even arguably unmeritorious claims resulting in large settlements. If any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful, or if we fail to develop non-infringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nIf our product candidates, methods, processes, and other technologies infringe the proprietary rights of other parties, we could incur substantial costs and we may have to:\n\u2022 Obtain licenses, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all;\n\u2022 Redesign our product candidates or processes to avoid infringement;\n\u2022 Stop using the subject matter claimed in the patents held by others;\n\u2022 Pay damages; or\n\u2022 Defend litigation or administrative proceedings which may be costly whether we win or lose, and which could result in a substantial diversion of our financial and management resources.\nWe may need to license intellectual property from third parties, and such licenses may not be available or may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.\nA third party may hold intellectual property, including patent rights that are important or necessary to the development of our product candidates. It may be necessary for us to use the patented or proprietary technology of a third party to manufacture or otherwise commercialize our own technology or products, in which case we would be required to obtain a license from such third party. Licensing such intellectual property may not be available or may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Owning Shares of Our Common Stock\nOur share price may be volatile, which could subject us to securities class action litigation and prevent you from being able to sell your shares at or above the price at which you acquired it.\nOur stock could be subject to wide fluctuation in response to many risk factors listed in this section, and others beyond our control, including:\n\u2022 Results and timing of our submissions with the EPA and other comparable regulatory authorities;\n\u2022 Failure or discontinuation of any of our development programs;\n\u2022 Regulatory developments or enforcements in the U.S. and non-U.S. countries with respect to our products or our competitors\u2019 products;\n\u2022 Failure to achieve pricing acceptable to the market;\n\u2022 Regulatory actions with respect to our products or our competitors\u2019 products;\n\u2022 Actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results;\n\u2022 Competition from existing products or new products that may emerge;\n\u2022 Announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, collaborations, or capital commitments;\n\u2022 Issuance of new or updated research or reports by securities analysts;\n\u2022 Fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;\n\u2022 Share price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares;\n\u2022 Additions or departures of key management or scientific personnel;\n\u2022 Disputes or other developments related to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters, and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies;\n\u2022 Entry by us into any material litigation or other proceedings;\n\u2022 Announcement or expectation of additional financing efforts;\n\u2022 Sales of our common stock by us, our insiders, or our other stockholders;\n\u2022 Market conditions for stocks in general; and\n\u2022 General economic and market conditions unrelated to our performance.\nFurthermore, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political, and market conditions such as recessions, interest rate changes, or international currency fluctuations, may negatively impact the market price of shares of our common stock. In addition, such fluctuations could subject us to securities class action litigation, which could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business. You may not realize any return on your investment in us and may lose some or all of your investment.\nAn active market in the shares may not continue to develop in which investors can resell our common stock.\nWe cannot predict the extent to which an active market for our common stock will continue to develop or be sustained, or how the development of such a market might affect the market price for our common stock. Market conditions in effect at the time you acquire our stock may not be indicative of the price at which our common stock will trade in the future. Investors may not be able to sell their common stock at or above the price they acquired it.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. We cannot assure that analysts will cover us or provide favorable coverage. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or change their opinion of our stock, our share price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nFuture sales, or the possibility of future sales, of a substantial number of our common shares could adversely affect the price of the shares and dilute stockholders.\nFuture sales of a substantial number of our common shares, or the perception that such sales will occur, could cause a decline in the market price of our common shares. As of March 29, 2017, we have 10,161,042 common shares outstanding. Each of our directors and executive officers and certain of our other security holders are subject to certain lock-up agreements which expire in June, 2017. If, after the end of such lock-up agreements, these stockholders sell substantial amounts of common shares in the public market, or the market perceives that such sales may occur, the market price of our common shares and our ability to raise capital through an issue of equity securities in the future could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, in the future, we may issue additional common shares or other equity or debt securities convertible into common shares in connection with a financing, acquisition, litigation settlement, employee arrangements, or otherwise. Any such issuance could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and could cause our common share price to decline.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as that term is used in the JOBS Act, and we intend to take advantage of reduced disclosure and governance requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, which could result in our common stock being less attractive to investors and adversely affect the market price of our common stock or make it more difficult to raise capital as and when we need it.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as that term is used in the JOBS Act, and we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved, and exemptions from any rules that the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board may adopt requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor\u2019s report on the financial statements. We currently intend to take advantage of some, but not all, of the reduced regulatory and reporting requirements that will be available to us under the JOBS Act, so long as we qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d For example, so long as we qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d we may elect not to provide you with certain information, including certain financial information and certain information regarding compensation of our executive officers, that we would have otherwise been required to provide in filings we make with the SEC, which may make it more difficult for investors and securities analysts to evaluate us.\nWe cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. We may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company, which in certain circumstances could be for up to five years.\nBecause of the exemptions from various reporting requirements provided to us as an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d we may be less attractive to investors and it may be difficult for us to raise additional capital as and when we need it. Investors may be unable to compare our business with other companies in our industry if they believe that our financial accounting is not as transparent as other companies in our industry. If we are unable to raise additional capital as and when we need it, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, and future prospects may be materially and adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 16532, "SIC": 2870, "TIC": "SNES"}
