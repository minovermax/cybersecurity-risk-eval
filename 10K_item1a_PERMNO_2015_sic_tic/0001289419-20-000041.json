{"cik": "1289419", "company": "Morningstar, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-02", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below and all of the other information included in this Form 10-K when deciding whether to invest in our common stock or otherwise evaluating our business. If any of the following risks materialize, our business, financial condition, or operating results could suffer. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. Our operations could also be affected by other risks that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations.\nOur investment management operations may subject us to liability for any losses that result from a breach of our fiduciary duties.\nThree of our subsidiaries, Morningstar Investment Management LLC, Morningstar Investment Services LLC, and Morningstar Research Services LLC, are registered as investment advisors with the SEC under the Advisers Act. As Registered Investment Advisors, these companies are subject to the requirements and regulations of the Advisers Act. These requirements primarily relate to record-keeping, reporting, and standards of care, as well as general anti-fraud prohibitions. The fiduciary duties of a Registered Investment Adviser to its clients include an obligation of good faith and full and fair disclosure of all facts material to the client\u2019s engagement of the advisor, an obligation to provide investment advice suitable for the particular client, an obligation to have a reasonable, independent basis for investment recommendations, an obligation when directing client brokerage transactions to seek the best execution thereof, and an obligation to vote client proxies in the best interests of the client. As Registered Investment Advisors, these subsidiaries are subject to on-site examination by the SEC.\nIn addition, in cases where these subsidiaries provide investment advisory services to retirement plans and their participants, they may be acting as fiduciaries under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. As fiduciaries under ERISA, they have obligations to act in the best interest of their clients. They also have duties of loyalty and prudence, as well as duties to diversify investments and to follow plan documents to comply with the applicable portions of ERISA.\nOur subsidiaries outside the U.S. that have investment advisory operations are subject to similar requirements.\nWe may face liabilities for actual or claimed breaches of our fiduciary duties, particularly in areas where we provide retirement advice and managed retirement accounts. In some of our retirement contracts, we act as an ERISA fiduciary by, for example, selecting and monitoring a broad range of diversified plan options. We also provide a managed account service for retirement plan participants who elect to have their accounts managed by our programs. Such activities have been the subject of increasing class action litigation in recent years. For example, in 2017, a participant in a pension plan filed a putative class action proceeding against us alleging that we, together with other defendant parties, violated the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act by allegedly engaging in actions to steer plan participants into high-cost investments that pay unwarranted fees to the defendants. Our motion to dismiss that proceeding was granted, but there can be no assurance that other putative class action proceedings based on the same or other legal theories may not be brought against us in different contexts or, if brought, will be successfully dismissed. As of December 31, 2019, we had $74.8 billion in assets under management in our managed retirement accounts. We could face substantial liabilities related to our management of these assets.\nWe rely on automated investment technology for our retirement advice and managed retirement accounts services. The Wealth Forecasting Engine is our core advice and managed accounts engine that determines appropriate asset allocations for retirement plan participants and assigns individuals to portfolios. We also rely on automated portfolio construction tools. Problems could arise if these programs do not work as intended, particularly if we failed to detect program errors over an extended period. Clients may take legal action against us for an actual or claimed breach of a fiduciary duty. If we make an error, we may be subject to potentially large liabilities for make-whole payments and/or litigation. We cannot quantify the potential size of these liabilities with any level of precision.\nIn addition, we may face other legal liabilities based on other theories of liability relating to various substantive requirements of the Advisers Act and other federal and state securities laws, even in the absence of an actual or claimed breach of fiduciary duty. In total, we provided investment advisory and management services on approximately $232.9 billion in assets as of December 31, 2019. We could face substantial liabilities related to our work on these assets.\nFailing to maintain and protect our brand, independence, and reputation may harm our business. Our reputation and business may also be harmed by allegations made about possible conflicts of interest or by other negative publicity or media reports.\nWe believe that our brand is well recognized and highly regarded at both a corporate and product level among key decision makers at purchasers and users of our products and services. We also believe independence is at the core of our brand and business, and our reputation is our greatest corporate asset. We rely on our reputation for integrity and high-caliber products and services as a competitive advantage. Any failure to uphold our high ethical standards and ensure that our customers have a consistently positive experience with us could damage our reputation, either as an objective, honest, and credible source for investment and credit research and information or as a trusted solutions provider to our asset management and investment advisory customers, or both. Allegations of improper conduct, whether the ultimate outcome is favorable or unfavorable to us, as well as negative publicity or media reports about Morningstar, whether valid or not, may harm our reputation and damage our business. In addition, any failures by us to continue to instill effectively in our employees the non-negotiable expectation of independence and integrity may devalue our reputation over time.\nAs our business has evolved, we have entered into lines of business and business arrangements that may give rise to allegations of conflicts of interest or perceived failures of our independence. We provide ratings, analyst research, and investment recommendations on mutual funds and other investment products offered by our institutional clients. While we don\u2019t charge asset management firms for their products to be rated, we do charge licensing fees for the use of our ratings. We also provide investment advisory and investment management services, including through our own series of mutual funds, which exposes us to the claim that we are acting as both a referee and a player in the investment management industry. In our credit rating business, which we recently significantly expanded through the purchase of DBRS, we are subject to an issuer-pay business model under which we receive payments from issuers for our credit ratings rather than from the investors who consume such ratings. These payments may create the perception that our credit ratings and research are not independently determined or reliable.\nOur reputation may also be harmed by factors outside of our control, such as news reports about our clients or adverse publicity about certain investment and ratings products. Our reputation could also suffer if we fail to produce competitive performance in our investment management offerings.\nWe could face significant reputational and financial consequences relating to cybersecurity and the protection of confidential information, including personal information about individuals.\nOur business requires that we securely collect, process, store, and transmit confidential information, including personal information, relating to our operations, customers, employees, and other third parties. We continuously invest in systems, processes, controls, and other security measures to guard against the risk of improper access to or release of such information. However, these measures do not guarantee absolute security, and improper access to or release of confidential information may still occur through employee error or malfeasance, system error, other inadvertent release, failure to properly purge and protect data, or cyberattack.\nWe may suffer malicious attacks by individuals or groups (including those sponsored by nation-states, terrorist organizations or global corporations seeking to illicitly obtain technology or other intellectual property) seeking to attack our products and services or penetrate our network infrastructure to gain access to confidential information, including personal information, or to launch or coordinate distributed denial of service attacks. While we have dedicated resources responsible for maintaining appropriate levels of cybersecurity and implemented systems and processes intended to help identify cyberattacks and protect and remediate our network infrastructure, these attacks have become increasingly frequent, sophisticated, and difficult to detect. Our measures may not be adequate for all eventualities and may be vulnerable to circumvention of security systems, denial-of-service attacks or other cyber-attacks, hacking, \u201cphishing\u201d attacks, computer viruses, ransomware or malware, employee or insider error, employee or vendor malfeasance, social engineering, physical breaches or other malicious actions.\nRecent well-publicized security breaches at other companies have led to enhanced government and regulatory scrutiny of the measures taken by companies to protect against cyberattacks and may in the future result in heightened cybersecurity requirements, including additional regulatory expectations for oversight of customers, vendors, and service providers. Our information technology systems interact with those of customers, vendors, and service providers. Our contracts with those parties typically require them to implement and maintain adequate security controls but we may not have the ability to effectively monitor the security measures of all our customers, vendors, and service providers. In a number of cases, our customers build and host their own web applications and access our solutions through our APIs. In these cases, additional risks reside in the customer\u2019s system with respect to security and preventive controls. As a result, inadequacies of our customers\u2019 security technologies and practices may only be detected after a security breach has occurred.\nAny failure to safeguard confidential information or any material cybersecurity failures or incidents in our systems (or the systems of a customer, vendor, or service provider which stores or processes confidential information for which we are responsible) could cause us to experience reputational harm, loss of customers, regulatory actions, sanctions or other statutory penalties, litigation or financial losses and increased expenses related to addressing or mitigating the risks associated with any such material failures or incidents.\nIn addition to the risks above related to general confidential information, we may also be subject to specific obligations relating to personal information and personal financial information. Our products and websites, routinely collect, store, process, and transmit personal information about an individual, including personally identifiable information and personal financial information such as portfolio holdings, account numbers, and credit card information. Our business also operates across national borders and routinely moves personal information from one jurisdiction to another. We and our customers are often subject to federal, state, and foreign laws relating to privacy, cybersecurity, and data protection. The scope of the laws that may be applicable is often uncertain and may be inconsistent with laws of other jurisdictions. Consequently, our business is subject to a variety of continuously evolving and possibly conflicting regulations and customer requirements. Our compliance with these changing and increasingly burdensome regulations and requirements may cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices which may impact financial results. If we fail to comply with these regulations or requirements we may be exposed to litigation expenses and possible significant liability, fees, or fines. For example, in the EU, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requirements could result in penalties of up to 4% of worldwide revenues.\nAdditionally, we make disclosures and statements regarding our use of personal information through our privacy policies and statements through our products and websites as required by privacy or data protection regulation. Failure to comply with our public statements or to adequately disclose our privacy or data protection practices could result in costly investigations by governmental authorities, litigation, and fines as well as reputational damage and customer loss.\nWe also from time to time acquire other companies that collect and process personal information. While we perform extensive due diligence on the technology systems of these companies, there can be no assurance that such companies have not suffered data breaches or system intrusions prior to or continuing after our acquisition for which we may be liable.\nWhile we maintain insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of cybersecurity and data protection risks, such coverage may not be sufficient to cover all or the majority of the costs, losses, or types of claims. Our insurance coverage would not extend to any reputational damage, loss of customers, or required improvements to our systems.\nFailing to differentiate our products and continuously create innovative, proprietary research tools and financial advisor software, or to successfully transition clients to new versions of such tools or software, may harm our competitive position and business results.\nWe attribute much of our company's success over the past 36 years to our ability to develop innovative, proprietary research tools, such as Gamma, the Morningstar Rating, Morningstar Style Box, Ownership Zone, and Portfolio X-Ray. More recently, we\u2019ve developed unique concepts and tools such as Investor Pulse, which combines fund data with predictive analytics, our Morningstar Quantitative and Sustainability Ratings for funds, our Global Risk Model, and Goal Bridge, our new financial planning software. We believe these innovations set us apart because many of our competitors focus on providing data or software rather than creating their own proprietary research frameworks. We also believe our ability to develop innovative, proprietary research tools is at the core of what drives Morningstar\u2019s value for all of our customer groups. With our financial advisor software products, we believe their functionality embeds them deeply in the advisor\u2019s daily workflows, which is a significant competitive advantage.\nIf we fail to continuously innovate and develop new research or software tools to meet the needs of our customers, our competitive position and business results may suffer. In addition, our reputation could be harmed if we\u2019re perceived as not moving quickly enough to meet the changing needs of investors or their financial advisors. These changing needs include a greater reliance on goals-based investing, the increased use of asset allocation portfolio models, and a significant emphasis on financial planning. Clients may also delay purchases of our currently offered research tools and software in anticipation of us offering new products or enhanced versions of existing products. Our competitive position and business results may also suffer if other companies are able to successfully introduce innovative, proprietary research tools and software that gain attention from our clients. We believe lower technology costs, the growth of open software platforms, and cloud computing technologies have lowered the barriers to entry for new competitors, making it easier for new players to enter the market. Smaller companies, including startup firms funded by private equity and venture capital, may be able to move more quickly to develop research, tools and advisor software platforms that gain a wide following.\nIn addition, the value of our data, research and software tools may be negatively affected by the increasing amount of information and tools that are available for free, or at low cost, through Internet sources or other low-cost delivery systems. Although we believe our products and services contain value-added features and functionality that deeply embed them in our customers\u2019 workflows, such developments may over time reduce the demand for, or customers\u2019 willingness to pay for, certain of our products and services.\nIf we fail to introduce innovative, proprietary research tools and frameworks or financial advisor software, we may not generate enough interest from potential clients to win new business. We cannot guarantee that we will successfully develop new product features and tools that differentiate our product offerings from those of our competitors.\nIn addition, we must make long-term investments and commit significant resources often before knowing whether such investments will result in products or services that satisfy our clients\u2019 needs or generate revenues sufficient to justify such investments. In addition, from time to time, we also incur costs to transition clients to new or enhanced products or services. Such transitions can involve material execution risks and challenges. If we are unable to manage these investments and transitions successfully, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nOur business, products and facilities are at risk of a number of material disruptive events which our operational risk management and business continuity programs may not be adequate to address.\nOur business and major products are dependent on our ability to provide data, software applications, and other products and services on a current and time-sensitive basis. We are at risk of disruptions from numerous factors, including pandemic, violent incident, natural disaster, power loss, telecommunications and internet failures, civil unrest, cybersecurity attacks and breaches, and other events beyond our reasonable control. We are also subject to potential shortcomings in our own business resilience practices, such as failures to fully understand dependencies between different business processes across the locations at which they are performed, inadequate vendor risk assessment and management processes and critical vendor dependencies, concentration of certain critical activities in areas of geopolitical risk or with \u201csingle point of failure\u201d employees or employee groups, and possibly ineffective location recovery strategies in the event of a location disruption.\nWe have approximately 1,750 employees working at our corporate headquarters in Chicago, Illinois. These include most of our executive leadership team, as well as substantial numbers of employees involved in the delivery of most of our major products and services. If our headquarters were to become unusable due to a pandemic, natural disaster, a violent incident, or another dangerous emergency, we might not be able to continue business operations at an acceptable level that would meet all our legal and contractual commitments.\nWe now have approximately 1,100 employees working in our data and technology development center in Shenzhen, China. We rely on these employees to maintain and update our mutual fund database and work on other projects. Because China has a restrictive government under centralized control and the relationship between the U.S. and China is experiencing a period of increased political, military, trade, and other commercial tensions, our operations are subject to political and regulatory risk, which is inherently unpredictable. Laws and regulations relating to data privacy, security, protection of intellectual property rights, and acceptable telecommunication infrastructure in China, as well as the enforcement environment for such laws and regulations, are in certain cases uncertain and evolving. In addition, this facility is subject from time to time to extreme weather events and has been most recently disrupted by the outbreak of a novel coronavirus which has limited employees' access to our offices. The concentration of certain types of development and data work carried out at this facility also involves operational risks for parts of our network infrastructure. While we have short-term backup plans in place, it would be difficult for us to maintain and update our mutual fund database if we were unable to access our Shenzhen operations for an extended period of time. Any difficulties that we face in continuing to operate our development center in China may harm our business and have a negative impact on the products and services we provide.\nWe have approximately 1,800 employees who work at our data collection, technology, and operational center in Mumbai, India. These employees maintain and update our equity database and PitchBook's data and research operations, and provide shared services to many of our operations. This location is subject to extreme weather events and political unrest, including public protests that can disrupt transportation and make it difficult for employees to commute to and from work. The electrical infrastructure of Mumbai is also subject to more frequent interruptions than are experienced at our other major facilities. In addition, Mumbai has experienced and may in the future experience terrorist attacks. While we have short-term backup plans in place to address such business continuity issues, it would be challenging for us to maintain and update our equity database or continue to provide certain shared services to our worldwide operations if we were unable to access our Mumbai operations for an extended period of time.\nWe engage third party vendors in several locations, including Colombia, India, and Ukraine who provide contract labor in support of our operations. Each of these locations has experienced various types of geopolitical risks and the labor force at those locations may be subject to instructions from the third party vendors in the case of a disruptive event that might need to take into consideration priorities different from our own. Any extended disruptions to our contract operations in these locations would make it difficult for us to meet our operating goals.\nFailing to respond to technological change, keep pace with new technology developments, or adopt a successful technology strategy may negatively affect our competitive position and business results.\nWe believe the technology landscape has been changing at an accelerating rate over the past several years. Changes in technology are fundamentally changing the ways investors access data and content. Examples include the shift from local network computing to cloud-based systems, the proliferation of wireless mobile devices, rapid acceleration in the use of social media platforms, the dissemination of data through application programming interfaces that permit real-time updating rather than raw data feeds, and the proliferation of machine learning and other artificial intelligence technologies. In addition, there has been an increasing focus on technology not merely supplying additional tools for users, but also offering solutions to specific client problems.\nOur software development process is based on frequently rolling out new features so that we can quickly incorporate user feedback. While some changes in technology may offer opportunities for Morningstar, we cannot guarantee that we will successfully adapt our product offerings to meet evolving customer needs. If we fail to develop and implement new technology rapidly enough, we may sacrifice new business opportunities or renewals from existing customers. We may also incur additional operating expense if major software projects take longer than anticipated. Our technology is also heavily dependent on the quality and comprehensiveness of our data and our ability to successfully build analytics, research, and other intellectual property around that data. We are investing significant resources in consolidating our various data assets and improving their usability and deliverability across our platform of products. Our competitive position and business results may suffer if we fail to develop new technologies to meet client demands, if our execution speed is too slow, if we adopt a technology strategy that doesn't align with changes in the market, or if we fail to realize the value and potential of our data assets.\nCompliance failures, regulatory action, or changes in laws applicable to our investment advisory or credit ratings operations could adversely affect our business.\nOur investment management operations are a growing part of our overall business. The securities laws and other laws that govern our investment advisory activities are complex. The activities of our investment advisory operations in the U.S. are subject to provisions of the Advisers Act, ERISA, and, in the case of our advisory relationship with the Morningstar Funds Trust, the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the Commodity Exchange Act. In addition, Morningstar Investment Services is a broker/dealer registered under the Exchange Act and is subject to the rules of FINRA. We also provide investment advisory services in other areas around the world, and our operations are subject to additional regulations in markets outside the U.S. If we fail to comply with securities laws and other regulatory requirements, we may be subject to fines or other events that could have a negative effect on our business.\nIn addition, subject to the outcome of the negotiations between the U.K. and the EU to govern their future relationship following Brexit, our investment management operations in the United Kingdom are reasonably likely to lose their \"passporting\" permissions that permit them to conduct business in other European jurisdictions based on their supervision by the FCA. The prospect of such a loss of permissions is already requiring us to restructure our European investment management operations through the application of our French investment advisory subsidiary, Morningstar Investment Consulting France SAS, for authorization from the ACPR to conduct business under the Directive 2014/65/CE (MiFID II) and be regulated as an investment firm (entreprise d\u2019investissement) by the ACPR. If such authorization is granted, Morningstar Investment Consulting France SAS will be able to provide investment advisory services (both on a discretionary or non-discretionary basis) to those EU institutional clients currently being serviced by Morningstar Investment Management Europe. We expect this restructuring to have a number of adverse effects in relation to cost structure, duplication of functions and operating expense. Similarly, prior to our acquisition of DBRS, DBRS also created and registered with ESMA, a separate Germany-based credit rating agency, in order to ensure continuity of its EU business. This effort required substantial time and expense, including the relocation of various employees, and will increase the complexity of credit rating activities in Europe to the extent regulation between the U.K. and the EU begins to diverge.\nIn 2019, we acquired DBRS, the world\u2019s fourth largest credit rating agency, for $669 million, and have been combining it with our legacy credit ratings business under the name DBRS Morningstar. DBRS Morningstar operates in a highly regulated environment in Canada, the U.S., and the EU. The laws and regulations governing credit ratings impose substantial ongoing compliance obligations and costs and subject DBRS Morningstar to regular regulatory examinations and occasional investigations, sometimes relating the credit ratings industry as a whole. In operating under these laws and regulations, DBRS Morningstar can experience good faith uncertainty over the scope, interpretation, and administration of such laws and regulations. In addition, differences between the laws and rules governing credit rating agencies in Canada, the U.S., and the EU can result in inconsistent regulatory requirements that it may not be possible to reconcile in a cost-efficient manner for a credit rating agency of DBRS Morningstar's size.\nNew laws and regulations may also affect the day-to-day operation of the business of DBRS Morningstar, its customers, and users of its credit ratings, including by imposing new or expanded requirements on such matters as communications with issuers as part of the rating assignment process, the manner in which DBRS Morningstar\u2019s ratings are developed and communicated, the manner in which customers may use credit ratings, and other aspects of the business model for credit rating agencies.\nOur index business could be negatively affected by increased regulation of benchmarks generally, which could increase the costs and risks of producing and administering indexes. Such regulations may discourage market participants from continuing to use, administer or contribute to indexes, trigger changes in the rules or methodologies relating indexes, and/or lead to declining demand for indexes.\nThe laws, rules, and regulations, and their interpretations, applicable to our business may change in the future, and we may not be able to comply with these changes without extensive changes to our business practices. In addition, the broad scope of our business operations makes it more difficult to monitor areas that may be subject to regulatory and compliance risk. If we fail to comply with any applicable law, rule, or regulation, we could be fined, sanctioned, or barred from providing investment advisory, credit rating or index services in the future, which could adversely affect our business.\nVolatility in the financial sector, global financial markets, and global economy may impact our results, resulting in lower revenue from asset-based fees and credit ratings business, as well as other parts of our business to a lesser extent.\nOur business results are partly driven by factors outside of our control, including general economic and financial market trends. Any unfavorable changes in the environment we operate in could cause a corresponding negative effect on our business results. As a result, we may experience lower revenue, operating income, and other financial results in the event of a market downturn.\nMany of our customers are asset-management firms and other financial-services companies, which are also subject to external trends and changes. For example, the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009 led to sustained spending cutbacks among many of the companies to which we sell. Some institutional clients implemented additional review processes for new contracts or started providing certain services, such as investment management, in-house rather than hiring outside service providers. Merger-and-acquisition activity in the financial services sector has in the past, and may in the future, reduce the number of potential clients for our products and services.\nMany companies in the financial services industry have also been subject to increasing government regulation and pressure to reduce fees. In turn, many of these firms have sought to reduce their operating costs by working with fewer service providers and/or negotiating lower fees for services they purchase.\nIn addition, our revenue from asset-based fees may be adversely affected by market declines, cash outflows from portfolios that we help manage, and the industrywide trend toward lower asset-based fees.\nIn 2019, asset-based revenue made up 18.0% of our consolidated revenue. The amount of asset-based revenue we earn primarily depends on the value of assets on which we provide advisory services, and the size of our asset base can increase or decrease along with trends in market performance.\nAsset levels can also be affected if net inflows into the portfolios on which we provide investment advisory services drop or if these portfolios experience redemptions. A drop in net inflows or an increase in redemptions can result from a variety of factors, including overall market conditions and volatility or a decline in investment performance. If the level of assets on which we provide investment advisory or investment management services goes down, we expect our fee-based revenue to show a corresponding decline.\nThe Morningstar Funds Trust, a registered open-end mutual fund for which Morningstar Investment Management acts as investment advisor under an investment management agreement, had assets under management of approximately $3.3 billion as of December 31, 2019. The Board of Trustees of the Morningstar Funds Trust must annually approve the terms of the investment management agreement (including fees) and can terminate the agreement upon 60-days' notice. If the Morningstar Funds Trust seeks to lower the fees that we receive or terminate its contract with us, we would experience a decline in fees earned from the Morningstar Funds, which could have a material adverse effect on the revenues and net income of our investment advisory services.\nWith our acquisition of DBRS, the portion of our revenues that is transaction-based increased to approximately\n13.1% for 2019. The credit rating business can be severely impacted by prolonged volatility in U.S. and international financial markets due to its dependence on the number and dollar volume of debt securities issued in the capital markets. Market disruptions and economic slowdowns have in the past, and may in the future, negatively impact the volume of debt securities issued in global capital markets and the demand for credit ratings. Conditions that reduce issuers\u2019 ability or willingness to issue debt securities, such as market volatility, declining growth, currency devaluations, or other adverse economic trends, reduce the number and value of debt issuances for which we provide credit ratings services and thereby adversely affect the fees we earn in our credit ratings business. Future debt issuances also could be negatively affected by increases in interest rates, widening credit spreads, regulatory and political developments, growth in the use of alternative sources of credit, and defaults by significant issuers. Our ability to reduce costs in the event of such adverse developments can be negatively impacted by, among other things, our obligations to monitor and maintain outstanding ratings. Declines or other changes in the markets for debt securities may materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nOur transactional business results may also be hurt by negative trends in Internet advertising sales, which made up 1.9% of consolidated revenue in 2019. Many advertisers have shifted some of their advertising spend to programmatic buying platforms that target users on other sites, which has from time to time had a negative effect on advertising revenue for our website for individual investors, Morningstar.com. We are uncertain whether this trend will continue.\nOur PitchBook business may also be subject to cyclical trends. Many of PitchBook's clients are investment banks and other participants in the capital and merger and acquisition markets, which are subject to periodic business downturns driven by changes in such markets. During these downturns, they often seek to reduce spending on third-party services as well as the number of employees, which would directly affect the number of prospective clients for PitchBook. As a data and research provider focusing on the private capital markets (including venture capital, private equity, and M&A), PitchBook may also be subject to volatility based on the amount of activity and market interest in these areas.\nOur results could suffer if investment strategies and portfolios relying on passively managed funds continue to attract an outsized portion of investor attention and investment, or if the financial industry continues to meaningfully consolidate.\nWe generate a significant portion of our revenue from products and services related to mutual funds, and part of our growth since 1984 can be attributed to favorable industry trends. A significant portion of our fund research has historically focused on equity-related funds. In addition, we are best-known for our data and analyst research on actively managed equity funds. Over the past 15 years, passively managed index funds have seen greater investor interest, and this trend has accelerated in recent years. Passively managed portfolios generally charge lower management fees than active strategies and lower management fees are a significant factor in investment recommendations of financial advisors and plan sponsors attempting to fulfill their fiduciary duties. However, the ascendance of passive strategies may affect both the profitability of asset managers, on whose success we in part depend, and the perceived value of our research regarding such strategies. In addition, the change in financial advisor activity away from security selection to goals-based asset allocation and portfolio construction and the increasing use of model portfolios, as well as the growth of online wealth management tools that provide automated, algorithm-based portfolio management advice, sometimes called robo-advice, may further reduce demand for our data and analyst research.\nThe growth of the mutual fund industry is also being affected by merger and acquisition activity within the asset management industry and brokerage and custodial distribution platforms, which is reducing the number of asset managers and platforms offering mutual funds and ETFs, the pruning by some mutual fund and ETF platforms of the number of funds available for purchase, and the continuing impacts of regulation. With respect to regulation, the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II) in the EU, which requires that asset managers pay banks and brokers for investment research, has presented us with new business opportunities, but has also caused some of our clients to adapt their business practices and pricing models significantly to reflect or avoid these new costs, which may adversely affect their demand for our services. Industry consolidation, such as the proposed merger of Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade, also may reduce demand for our software products that support financial advisers and also gives the combined entities additional pricing power with respect to some of our investment products like Retirement Managed Portfolios.\nProlonged downturns or volatility in the financial markets, increased investor interest in other investment vehicles, or a lack of investor confidence could reduce investor interest and investment activity and decrease demand for our products, including our software, data, and analyst research.\nWe could face liability for the information and data we collect and distribute or the reports and other documents produced by our software products.\nWe may be subject to claims for securities law violations, defamation (including libel and slander), negligence, or other claims relating to the information we publish, including our research and credit ratings. For example, investors may take legal action against us if they rely on published information that contains an error, or a company may claim that we have made a defamatory statement about it or its employees. In addition, in our credit ratings business, we have access to significant amounts of material nonpublic information on issuers of securities, the inadvertent disclosure of which, or the misappropriation by employees or others, could expose us to various liabilities under securities and other laws.\nSome of our products support the investment processes or the client account reporting practices and other activities of our clients who manage significant assets of other parties. Use of our products as part of such activities creates the risk that clients, or the parties whose assets are managed by our clients, may pursue claims against us for losses that may have some connection to our products. In the case of software products, even though most of our contracts for such products contain limitations of our liability in such cases, we may be required to make such clients or their customers whole for any losses in order to maintain our business relationships. We could also be subject to claims based on the content that is accessible from our website through links to other websites.\nWe rely on a variety of outside parties as the original sources for the information we use in our published data. These sources include securities exchanges, fund companies, hedge funds, transfer agents, and other data providers. We also incorporate data from a variety of third-party sources for PitchBook. Accordingly, in addition to possible exposure for publishing incorrect information that results directly from our own errors, we could face liability based on inaccurate data provided to us by others.\nWe could be subject to claims by providers of publicly available data and information we compile from websites and other sources that we have improperly obtained that data in violation of the source\u2019s copyrights or terms of use or based on the provisions of legislation such as GDPR that limit the bases on which businesses can collect personal information from and about individuals. We could also be subject to claims from third parties such as securities exchanges from which we license and redistribute data and information that we have used or redistributed the data or information in ways not permitted by our license rights or that we have inadequately permissioned our clients to use such data. The agreements with such exchanges and other data providers give them extensive data use audit rights, and such audits can be expensive and time consuming and potentially result in substantial fines. Defending claims based on the information we publish could be expensive and time-consuming and could adversely impact our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nAn outage of our database, technology-based products and services or network facilities could result in reduced revenue and the loss of customers, and our movement of parts of our technological and data infrastructure to the public cloud and other outsourced providers could expose us to various third party provider risks.\nThe success of our business depends upon our ability to deliver time-sensitive, up-to-date data and information that meets client expectations and contractual requirements. We rely extensively on our computer systems, database storage facilities, and other network infrastructure, which is located across multiple facilities in the U.S. and globally. Our mission-critical databases and networks are complex and interdependent, which increases the risk of failure. Problems in our network systems may lead to cascading effects involving product downtime, overloading of third-party data centers, and other issues that may affect our clients. Many of our client contracts contain service-level agreements that require us to meet certain obligations for delivering time-sensitive, up-to-date data and information. We may not be able to meet these obligations in the event of failure or downtime in our information systems.\nOur operations and those of our suppliers and customers are vulnerable to interruption by fire, earthquake, power loss, telecommunications failure, terrorist attacks, wars, computer viruses, and other events beyond our control. Our database and network facilities may also be vulnerable to external attacks that misappropriate our data, corrupt our databases, or limit access to our information systems. To defend against these threats, we implement a series of controls focusing on both prevention and detection, including firewalls, intrusion detection systems, automated scanning and testing, server hardening, antivirus software, training, and patch management. We make significant investments in servers, storage, and other network infrastructure to prevent incidents of network failure and downtime, but we cannot guarantee that these efforts will work as planned.\nMost of our products and services depend heavily on our electronic delivery systems and the Internet, although we are shifting the storage of our data and delivery of several of our products and services to cloud-based delivery systems. Our ability to deliver information using the Internet may be impaired because of infrastructure failures, service outages at third-party Internet providers, malicious attacks, or other factors. If disruptions, failures, or slowdowns of our electronic delivery systems or the Internet occur, our ability to distribute our products and services effectively and to serve our customers may be impaired.\nWe maintain off-site backup facilities for our data, but we cannot guarantee that these facilities will operate as expected during an interruption that affects our primary facility. There may be single points of failure that affect our core databases, data transfer interfaces, or storage area networks. We may not be able to fully recover data or information lost during a database or network facility outage. Any losses, service disruption, or damages incurred by us could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial condition.\nOur movement of parts of our technological infrastructure to the public cloud and software-as-a-service (SaaS) solutions presents a variety of additional risks, including risks relating to sharing the same computing resources with other users, the use by cloud and SaaS providers of virtualization products and various security issues relating thereto, reliance on cloud and SaaS providers\u2019 authentication, authorization and access control mechanisms, a lack of control over cloud and SaaS providers\u2019 redundancy systems and fault tolerances, and a reduced ability to directly address client concerns over data security and privacy. Any disruption of or interference with our use of the public cloud or SaaS solutions, or any information security breach at any cloud or SaaS provider, could materially impact our operations and have an adverse effect on our business. We are also currently moving to outsourced technology solutions around our on-premise data centers to better interface with cloud and SaaS platforms and reduce complexity and cost. However, over time, a growing dependence of our technology and data infrastructure on the public cloud and SaaS solutions also risks us becoming overly dependent on particular suppliers, which could adversely affect the pricing we receive from such suppliers and limit our ability to transition away from such suppliers in the event of service-quality issues.\nOur acquisitions and other investments may not produce the results we anticipate. We may also incur debt in connection with acquisitions, which may limit our financial flexibility.\nWe have completed numerous acquisitions over the past 10 years, including our acquisition of DBRS in 2019 for $669.0 million, and we intend to continue to pursue selective acquisitions to support our business strategy. However, there can be no assurance we can identify suitable acquisition candidates at acceptable prices. In addition, each acquisition presents potential challenges and risks. We may not achieve the growth targets that we established for the acquired business at the time of the acquisition. The process of integration may require more resources than we anticipated. We may assume unintended liabilities or experience operating difficulties or costs that we did not anticipate. We may also fail to retain key personnel of the acquired business which would make it difficult to follow through on our operating goals for the business. If an acquisition does not generate the results we anticipate, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn connection with certain acquisitions, we have incurred indebtedness. Under our existing credit facility entered into in connection with the DBRS acquisition, we can borrow up to $750.0 million, $300.0 million under a revolving credit facility and $450.0 million under a term loan facility. The term of this facility expires in July 2024. Under the terms of our agreement with the lender, we are subject to certain restrictions and financial covenants, which may limit our financial flexibility. As of December 31, 2019, borrowings in the principal amount of $513.1 million are outstanding under such facility. While our business has historically generated strong cash flow and interest rates on corporate indebtedness are at historically low levels, our level of indebtedness as of the end of 2019 is significantly higher than it has been in our company\u2019s history and our ability to manage our business with such a level of indebtedness is unproven. In addition, our long-term indebtedness currently bears interest at fluctuating interest rates based on the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) for deposits of U.S. dollars. During 2017, the U.K.\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (the authority that regulates LIBOR) announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. It is not clear whether new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021 or if other regulators, such as the U.S. Federal Reserve, will seek to establish alternative reference rate mechanisms for the calculation of floating interest rates. It is not possible to predict the effect of these changes to LIBOR or the establishment of alternative reference rates on our borrowing costs over time or the availability to us of credit.\nWe also have, and intend to continue to make, various investments in companies where we do not have or obtain a controlling interest. Such investments are motivated both by their prospective financial return and the access they give us to certain new technologies, products, business ideas and management teams. While we obtain various rights in connection with such investments, the future value of such investments is highly dependent on the management skill of the managers of those companies.\nWe expect to continue making acquisitions and establishing investments and joint ventures as part of our long-term business strategy. Acquisitions, investments, and joint ventures involve a number of risks. They can be time-consuming and may divert management\u2019s attention from day-to-day operations, particularly if numerous acquisitions are in process at the same time. Financing an acquisition could result in dilution from issuing equity securities, reduce our financial flexibility because of reductions in our cash balance, or result in a weaker balance sheet from incurring debt.\nOur future success depends on our ability to recruit, develop, and retain qualified employees.\nWe experience competition for analysts, technology experts, data and software engineers and other employees from other companies and organizations. Competition for these employees is intense, and we may not be able to retain our existing employees or be able to recruit and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future. In addition, we are exposed to overall rising wage scales in the employment markets in which some of our facilities are located, such as our development center in China, which negatively affects our ability to hire personnel generally without significantly increasing our compensation costs. In China, we believe our ability to hire qualified personnel is also being negatively impacted by the preference of job candidates to work for Chinese companies, as opposed to multinationals, in a period of increasing international tensions.\nOur future success also depends on the continued service of our executive officers, including Joe Mansueto, our executive chairman and largest shareholder, and Kunal Kapoor, our Chief Executive Officer. The loss of Mansueto, Kapoor, or other executive officers could hurt our business, operating results, or financial condition. We do not have employment agreements, noncompete agreements, or life insurance policies in place with any of our executive officers. They may leave us and work for our competitors or start their own competing businesses.\nOur operations outside of the U.S. involve additional challenges that we may not be able to meet.\nOur operations outside of the U.S. generated $312.6 million in revenue in 2019, or about 27% of our consolidated revenue. There are risks inherent in doing business outside the U.S., including challenges in reaching new markets because of established competitors and limited brand recognition; difficulties in staffing, managing, and integrating non-U.S. operations; difficulties in coordinating and sharing information globally; differences in laws and policies from country to country, including in relation to employment terms and conditions; exposure to varying legal standards, including intellectual property protection laws; potential tax exposure related to transfer pricing and other issues; heightened risk of fraud and noncompliance in some jurisdictions; and currency exchange rates and exchange controls. In addition, new risks have arisen from the assertion by various national governments of greater control over the movements of people and information across national borders. For example, changes to immigration policy in the United Kingdom as a result of Brexit and in the U.S. as a result of the current administration\u2019s more restrictive immigration enforcement could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain talent from other countries. In addition, China\u2019s government has backed various measures that could compromise the privacy and security of our proprietary information or information concerning our customers including a ban on nonstate sanctioned virtual private networks and requirements that multinational firms acquire and use equipment from Chinese telecom suppliers. These risks could hamper our ability to expand around the world, which may hurt our financial performance and ability to grow.\nWe don't engage in currency hedging or have any positions in derivative instruments to hedge our currency risk. Our reported revenue could suffer if certain foreign currencies decline relative to the U.S. dollar, although the impact on operating income may be offset by an opposing currency impact on locally based operating expense.\nFailure to protect our intellectual property rights, or claims of intellectual property infringement against us, could harm our brand and ability to compete effectively.\nThe steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not be adequate to safeguard our proprietary information. We rely primarily on patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret rights, as well as contractual protections and technical safeguards, to protect our intellectual property rights and proprietary information. Despite these efforts, third parties may still attempt to challenge, invalidate, or circumvent our rights or improperly obtain our proprietary information. Further, effective trademark, copyright, and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which we offer our services. Failure to adequately protect our intellectual property could harm our brand, devalue our proprietary content, and affect our ability to compete in the marketplace.\nFrom time to time, we encounter jurisdictions in which one or more third parties have a pre-existing trademark registration in certain relevant international classes that may prevent us from registering our own marks in those jurisdictions. Our continued ability to use the \u201cMorningstar\u201d name or logo, either on a stand-alone basis or in association with certain products or services, could be compromised in those jurisdictions because of these pre-existing registrations. Similarly, from time to time, we encounter situations in certain jurisdictions where one or more third parties are already using the Morningstar name, either as part of a registered corporate name, a registered domain name, or otherwise. Our ability to effectively market certain products and/or services in those locations could be adversely affected by these pre-existing usages.\nWe have from time to time been subject to claims by third parties alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights. Such claims can also be alleged against clients, customers, or distributors of our products or services whom we have agreed to indemnify against third party claims of infringement. The defense of such claims can be costly and consume valuable management time and attention. We may be forced to settle such claims on unfavorable terms, which can include the payment of damages, the entry into royalty or licensing arrangements on commercially unfavorable terms, or the suspension of our ability to offer affected products or services. If litigation were to arise from any such claim, there can be no certainty we would prevail in it. If any of these risks were to materialize, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nControl by a principal shareholder could adversely affect our other shareholders.\nAs of December 31, 2019, Joe Mansueto, our executive chairman, owned approximately 49% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, he has the practical ability to control substantially all matters submitted to our shareholders for approval, including the election and removal of directors and any merger, consolidation, or sale of our assets. This concentration of ownership may delay or prevent a change in control, impede a merger, consolidation, takeover, or other business combination involving Morningstar, discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of the company, or result in actions that may be opposed by other shareholders.\nFluctuations in our operating results may negatively affect our stock price.\nWe believe our business has relatively large fixed costs and low variable costs, which magnify the impact of revenue fluctuations on our operating results. As a result, a decline in our revenue may lead to a larger decline in operating income. In addition, because we manage our business with a long-term perspective, we generally don\u2019t make significant adjustments to our strategy or cost structure in response to short-term factors. As a result, our operating results may suffer in the short term. In addition, we do not provide earnings guidance or hold one-on-one meetings with institutional investors and research analysts. Because of this policy and limited analyst coverage on our stock, our stock price may not always reflect the intrinsic value of our business and assets. If our operating results or other operating metrics fail to meet the expectations of outside research analysts and investors, the market price of our common stock may decline.\nThe future sale of shares of our common stock may negatively affect our stock price.\nIf our significant shareholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock, the market price of our common stock could fall. A significant reduction in ownership by Joe Mansueto or any other large shareholder could cause the market price of our common stock to fall. In addition, the average daily trading volume in our stock is relatively low. The lack of trading activity in our stock may lead to greater fluctuations in our stock price. Low trading volume may also make it difficult for shareholders to make transactions in a timely fashion.", "PERMNO": 90708, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "MORN"}
