{"cik": "1650962", "company": "Manitowoc Foodservice, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-30", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe following risk factors have been identified by management in that if any events contemplated by the following risks actually occur, then our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nWe face the following risks in connection with our business and the general conditions and trends of the foodservice industry in which our products are sold:\nWe have substantial indebtedness, and the degree to which we are leveraged may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to make payments on and to refinance our substantial indebtedness, including the debt retained or incurred pursuant to the Spin-Off as well as any future debt that we may incur, will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future from operations, financings or asset sales. Our ability to generate cash is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. We may not generate sufficient funds to service our debt and meet our business needs, such as funding working capital or the expansion of our operations. If we are not able to repay or refinance our debt as it becomes due, we may be forced to take disadvantageous actions, including reducing spending on marketing, advertising and new product innovation, reducing future financing for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes, selling assets or dedicating an unsustainable level of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness. In addition, our ability to withstand competitive pressures and to react to changes in the foodservice industry could be impaired. The lenders who hold our debt could also accelerate amounts due in the event that we default, which could potentially trigger a default or acceleration of the maturity of our other debt.\nIn addition, our substantial leverage could put us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged. These competitors could have greater financial flexibility to pursue strategic acquisitions and secure additional financing for their operations. Our substantial leverage could also impede our ability to withstand downturns in our industry or the economy in general.\nOur operational results are dependent on how well we can scale our manufacturing capacity and resources to the level of our customers\u2019 demand.\nOur products are sold in an industry that requires manufacturers to make highly efficient use of manufacturing capacity. Insufficient or excess capacity threatens our ability to generate competitive profit margins and may expose us to liabilities related to contract commitments. Adapting or modifying our capacity is difficult, as modifications take substantial time to execute and, in some cases, may require regulatory approval. Additionally, delivering product during process or facility modifications requires special coordination. The cost and resources required to adapt our capacity, such as through facility acquisitions, facility closings, or process moves between facilities, may negate any planned cost reductions or may result in costly delays, product quality issues or material shortages, all of which could adversely affect our operational results and our reputation with our customers.\nIf we are unable to successfully implement certain cost-reduction initiatives, we may not achieve our earnings targets.\nWe have developed initiatives to realize cost savings, for example, by reducing the complexity of our product offerings, including our \u201c80/20\u201d initiative that will focus the majority of our resources on our most important products and best customers. However, the success of this and other profit-enhancement and cost-reduction initiatives is not guaranteed, and we may not achieve the cost savings we expect. The 80/20 initiative in particular involves significant cultural shifts, both internally and for our customers, that may inhibit or impair its successful implementation. Additionally, if we devote a disproportionate amount of time, personnel and resources to initiatives that yield slower or less than anticipated results or that are ultimately unsuccessful, we may be distracted from other initiatives and priorities that might have yielded more rapid or better results, and our results of operations may suffer accordingly.\nPrice increases or our inability to execute successful pricing strategies for some materials and sources of supply, as well as disruptions of supplies of some materials, could affect our profitability.\nWe use large amounts of steel, stainless steel, aluminum, copper and electronic controls, among other items, in the manufacture of our products. Occasionally, market prices of some of our key raw materials increase significantly, which could adversely affect our margins. Furthermore, although we are implementing a strategic sourcing initiative, we may not be able to achieve the expected cost savings from that initiative. In addition, because we maintain limited raw material and component inventories, even brief unanticipated delays in delivery by suppliers - including those due to capacity constraints, labor disputes, impaired financial condition of suppliers, weather emergencies or other natural disasters - may impair our ability to satisfy our customers and could adversely affect our financial performance.\nTo better manage our exposures to certain commodity price fluctuations, we regularly hedge our commodity exposures through financial markets. Through this hedging program we fix the future price for a portion of these commodities used in the production of our products. To the extent that our hedging results in fixing commodity prices that are unfavorable in comparison to market prices at the time of purchase, we would experience a negative impact on our profit margins compared to the margins we would have realized if these price commitments were not in place, which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows in future periods.\nBecause we participate in an industry that is highly competitive, our net sales and profits could decline as we respond to competition.\nWe sell our products in a highly competitive industry. We compete based on product design, quality of products, quality and responsiveness of product support services, product performance and reliability, maintenance costs and price. Some of our competitors may have greater financial, marketing, manufacturing and distribution resources than we do. Competition could cause our sales to decrease or cause us to cut prices or incur additional costs to remain competitive, any of which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAdditionally, a substantial portion of our dealer revenue comes from a small number of buying groups, which gives those buying groups a large degree of leverage and purchasing power with us and other suppliers. In recent years those buying groups have used their leverage to extract larger rebates, discounts and other price reductions. We must continually balance the added revenue from providing reduced prices to those buying groups against the reduced margins generated by them, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nIf we do not develop new and innovative products or if customers in our markets do not accept them, our results would be negatively affected.\nOur products must be kept current to meet our customers\u2019 needs, overcome competitive products and meet evolving regulatory requirements. To remain competitive, we therefore must develop new and innovative products on an on-going basis, and we invest significantly in the research and development of new products. If we do not successfully develop innovative products, it may be difficult to differentiate our products from our competitors' products and satisfy regulatory requirements, and our sales and results would suffer.\nIf we do not meet customers\u2019 product quality and reliability standards/expectations, we may experience increased or unexpected product warranty claims and other adverse consequences to our business.\nProduct quality and reliability are significant factors influencing customers\u2019 decisions to purchase our products. Inability to maintain the high quality of our products relative to the perceived or actual quality of similar products offered by competitors could result in the loss of market share, loss of revenue, reduced profitability, an increase in warranty costs, and/or damage to our reputation. Similarly, if we fail to provide the same level of quality through our KitchenCare aftermarket parts and repair service as we provide in original equipment manufacturing, it could likewise negatively affect our revenue and our reputation with our customers.\nProduct quality and reliability are determined in part by factors that are not entirely within our control. We depend on our suppliers for parts and components that meet our standards. If our suppliers fail to meet those standards, we may not be able to deliver the quality products that our customers expect, which may impair revenue and our reputation and lead to higher warranty costs.\nWe provide our customers a warranty covering workmanship, and in some cases materials, on products we manufacture. Our warranty generally provides that products will be free from defects for periods ranging from 12 months to 60 months with certain equipment having longer term warranties. If a product fails to comply with the warranty, we may be obligated, at our expense, to correct any defect by repairing or replacing the defective product. Although we maintain warranty reserves in an amount based primarily on the number of units shipped and on historical and anticipated warranty claims, there can be no assurance that future warranty claims will follow historical patterns or that we can accurately anticipate the level of future warranty claims. An increase in the rate of warranty claims or the occurrence of unexpected warranty claims could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nChanging consumer tastes and government regulations affecting the quick-service restaurant industry could affect sales to our largest customers.\nA number of our largest customers operate in the quick-service restaurant industry. The quick-service restaurant industry is frequently affected by changes in consumer tastes and eating habits, often as a result of new information or attitudes regarding diet and health or as a result of government regulations requiring quick-service restaurants to disclose the nutritional content of their food. If consumers\u2019 eating habits change significantly, our customers may choose or be required to modify their menu offerings. Such modifications, or the failure to make the modifications to the extent consumers desire, could have an adverse effect on our customers\u2019 business, financial conditions or results, which in turn could adversely affect the customers' demand for our products.\nWe have significant manufacturing and sales of our products outside of the United States, which may present additional risks to our business.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, approximately 32.1%, 37.1% and 38.4%, respectively, of our net sales were attributable to products sold outside of the United States. Expanding our international sales is part of our growth strategy. International operations generally are subject to various risks, including political, military, religious and economic instability, local labor market conditions, the imposition of foreign tariffs, the impact of foreign government regulations, the effects of income and withholding tax, governmental expropriation, and differences in business practices. We may incur increased costs and experience delays or disruptions in product deliveries and payments in connection with our international sales, manufacturing and the integration of new facilities that could cause loss of revenue or increased cost. Unfavorable changes in the political, regulatory and business climate and currency devaluations of various foreign jurisdictions could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur results of operations may be negatively impacted by product liability lawsuits.\nOur business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture, sale and use of our products. We have not to date incurred material costs related to these product liability claims. We vigorously defend ourselves against current claims and intend\nto do so against future claims. However, a substantial increase in the number of claims that are made against us or the amounts of any judgments or settlements could adversely affect our reputation and our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we fail to protect our intellectual property rights or maintain our rights to use licensed intellectual property, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur patents, trademarks and licenses are important in the operation of our businesses. Although we protect our intellectual property rights vigorously, we cannot be certain that we will be successful in doing so. Third parties may assert or prosecute infringement or validity claims against us in connection with the services and products that we offer, and we may or may not be able to successfully defend these claims. Litigation, either to enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend against claimed infringement of the rights of others, could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources. In addition, if a third party would prevail in an infringement claim against us, then we would likely need to obtain a license from the third party on commercial terms, which would likely increase our costs. Our failure to maintain or obtain necessary licenses or an adverse outcome in any litigation relating to patent infringement or other intellectual property matters could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nSales of our products are sensitive to volatile or variable factors. A downturn or weakness in overall economic activity or fluctuations in weather or other factors could adversely affect us.\nHistorically, sales of products that we manufacture and sell have been subject to variations caused by changes in general economic conditions and other factors. In particular, the strength of the economy generally may affect the rates of expansion, consolidation, renovation and equipment replacement within the restaurant, lodging, convenience store and healthcare industries, which may affect our sales. Furthermore, any future economic recession may impact leveraged companies like us more than competing companies with less leverage and may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWeather conditions can substantially affect our business, as relatively cool summer weather and cooler-than-normal weather in hot climates tend to decrease sales of ice and beverage dispensers. Our sales depend in part upon our customers\u2019 replacement or repair cycles. Adverse economic conditions may cause customers to forego or postpone new purchases in favor of repairing existing machinery.\nIf we are unable to sufficiently adjust to market conditions, among other potential adverse effects on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, we could fail to deliver on planned results, fall short of analyst and investor expectations, incur higher fixed costs, and/or fail to benefit from higher than expected customer demand resulting in loss of market share.\nOur operations and profitability could suffer if we experience labor relations problems.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we employed approximately 5,500 people and had eight labor agreements with six employee unions in North America. A large majority of our European employees belong to European trade unions, and we have one trade union in China. During 2015, three of our union contracts expired. Each contract that expired in 2015 was successfully renegotiated without incident. In 2016, we have two union contracts that will expire. Any significant labor relations issues could adversely affect our operations, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are exposed to the risk of changes in interest rates or foreign currency fluctuations.\nWe have indebtedness that accrues interest at a variable rate. Increases in interest rates will reduce our operating cash flows and could hinder our ability to fund our operations, capital expenditures, acquisitions or dividends. In such cases we may seek to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, but hedging our exposure carries the risk that we may forego the benefits we would otherwise experience if interest rates were to change in our favor. Developing an effective strategy for dealing with movements in interest rates is complex, and no strategy is guaranteed to completely insulate us from the risks associated with such fluctuations.\nAdditionally, some of our operations are or may be conducted by subsidiaries in foreign countries. The results of the operations and the financial position of these subsidiaries will be reported in the relevant foreign currencies and then translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our combined financial statements, which are stated in U.S. dollars. The exchange rates between many of these currencies and the U.S. dollar have fluctuated significantly in recent years and may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future. Such fluctuations may have a material effect on our results of operations and financial position and may significantly affect the comparability of our results between financial periods.\nWe also incur currency transaction risk whenever one of our operating subsidiaries enters into a transaction using a different currency than its functional currency. We attempt to reduce currency transaction risk whenever one of our operating subsidiaries enters into a material transaction using a different currency than its functional currency by:\n\u2022\nmatching cash flows and payments in the same currency;\n\u2022\ndirect foreign currency borrowing; and\n\u2022\nentering into foreign exchange contracts for hedging purposes.\nHowever, we may not be able to hedge this risk completely or at an acceptable cost, which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows in future periods.\nChanges to tax laws or exposure to additional tax liabilities may have a negative impact on our operating results.\nTax policy reform continues to be a topic of discussion in the U.S. A significant change to the tax system in the U.S., including changes to the taxation of international income, could have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations. We regularly undergo tax audits in various jurisdictions in which our products are sold. Although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable and that we prepare our tax filings in accordance with all applicable tax laws, the final determination with respect to any tax audits, and any related litigation, could be materially different from our estimates or from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could materially affect our operating results and/or cash flows in the periods for which that determination is made. In addition, future period earnings may be adversely impacted by litigation costs, settlements, penalties, and/or interest assessments.\nOur business and/or reputation could be negatively affected as a result of actions of activist shareholders, and such activism could impact the trading value of our securities.\nCertain of our stockholders may in the future publicly or privately express views with respect to the operation of our business, our business strategy, corporate governance considerations or other matters that may not be fully aligned with our own. Responding to actions by activist shareholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations and divert the attention of management and our employees. Perceived uncertainties as to our future direction may result in the loss of potential business opportunities, damage to our reputation, and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified directors, personnel and business partners. These actions could also cause our stock price to experience periods of volatility.\nActivist shareholders may in the future make strategic proposals, suggestions, or requests for changes concerning the operation of our business, our business strategy, corporate governance considerations, or other matters. We cannot predict, and no assurances can be given, as to the outcome or timing of any consequences arising from these actions, and any such consequences may impact the value of our securities.\nEnvironmental liabilities that may arise in the future could be material to us.\nOur operations, facilities and properties are subject to extensive and evolving laws and regulations pertaining to air emissions, wastewater discharges, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous materials and wastes, the remediation of contamination, and otherwise relating to health, safety and the protection of the environment. As a result, we are involved from time to time in administrative or legal proceedings relating to environmental and health and safety matters, and have in the past and will continue to incur capital and other expenditures relating to such matters. We also cannot be certain that identification of presently unidentified environmental conditions, more vigorous enforcement by regulatory authorities, or other unanticipated events will not arise in the future and give rise to additional environmental liabilities, compliance costs and/or penalties that could be material. Further, environmental laws and regulations are constantly evolving and it is impossible to predict accurately the effect any changes may have upon our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, as well as personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, in our internal and external data centers, cloud services, and on our networks. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure, and that of our partners, may be vulnerable to malicious attacks or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions, including as a result of roll-outs of new systems. Any such breach or operational failure could compromise our networks and/or that of our partners and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings and/or regulatory penalties, disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and/or cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, which could adversely affect our business.\nOur inability to recover from natural or man-made disasters could adversely affect our business.\nOur business and financial results may be affected by certain events that we cannot anticipate or that are beyond our control, such as natural or man-made disasters, national emergencies, significant labor strikes, work stoppages, political unrest, war or terrorist activities that could curtail production at our facilities and cause delayed deliveries and canceled orders. In addition, we purchase components and raw materials and information technology and other services from numerous suppliers, and, even if our facilities were not directly affected by such events, we could be affected by interruptions at such suppliers. Such suppliers may be less likely than our own facilities to be able to quickly recover from such events and may be subject to additional risks such as financial problems that limit their ability to conduct their operations. We cannot assure you that we will have insurance to adequately compensate us for any of these events.\nOur international sales and operations are subject to applicable laws relating to trade, export controls and foreign corrupt practices, the violation of which could adversely affect our operations.\nWe must comply with all applicable international trade, customs, export controls and economic sanctions laws and regulations of the U.S. and other countries. We are also subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-bribery laws that generally bar bribes or unreasonable gifts to foreign governments or officials. Changes in trade sanctions laws may restrict our business practices, including cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries or with sanctioned entities, and may result in modifications to compliance programs. Violation of these laws or regulations could result in sanctions or fines and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCompliance with regulations related to conflict minerals may force us to incur additional expenses and affect the manufacturing and sale of our products.\nIn recent years, governments in both the U.S. and Europe have implemented or proposed regulations governing the use of certain minerals, including tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold (\u201cconflict minerals\u201d). In the U.S., SEC rules require disclosures related to conflict minerals that are necessary to the functionality or production of a product manufactured, or contracted to be manufactured, by an SEC-reporting company, that are sourced from the Democratic Republic of Congo and other countries in central Africa. In the European Union, proposed regulations would require similar disclosures, and may encompass other geographic regions outside of central Africa.\nThese disclosure requirements could affect the sourcing and availability of some of the minerals used in the manufacture of our products. Our supply chain is complex, and if we are not able to conclusively verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in our products or that our products are \u201cconflict free,\u201d we may face reputational challenges with our customers or investors. Furthermore, we may also encounter challenges to satisfy customers who require that our products be certified as \u201cconflict free,\u201d which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are unable to do so. Additionally, as there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering \u201cconflict free\u201d metals, we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain necessary metals from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Finally, because European regulations have not yet been finalized, it is difficult for us to determine whether and how we will establish a compliance program. For all of these reasons, we could incur significant costs related to the conflict minerals compliance process, and face equally significant costs in satisfying the disclosure requirements.\nWe may increase our debt or raise additional capital in the future, including to fund acquisitions, or for general corporate purposes, which could affect our financial health and decrease our profitability.\nWe may increase our debt or raise additional capital in the future, subject to restrictions in our debt agreements. In addition, our Board may issue shares of preferred stock without further action by holders of our common stock. If our cash flow from operations is less than we anticipate, or if our cash requirements are more than we expect, we may require more financing. However, debt or equity financing may not be available to us on terms we find acceptable, if at all. If we incur additional debt or raise equity through the issuance of our preferred stock, the terms of the debt or our preferred stock issued may give the holders rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock, particularly in the event of liquidation. If we raise funds through the issuance of additional equity, our then-existing stockholders' ownership in us would be diluted. Also, regardless of the terms of our debt or equity financing, our agreements and obligations under the Tax Matters Agreement may limit our ability to issue stock. For a more detailed discussion, see \u201cWe may not be able to engage in certain transactions after the Spin-Off.\u201d If we are unable to raise additional capital when needed, our financial condition, and thus your investment in us, could be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to the Spin-Off\nWe face the following risks in connection with the Spin-Off:\nThere could be significant liability if the Spin-Off is determined to be a taxable transaction, and we could have an indemnification obligation to MTW if the transactions we undertook in the Spin-Off do not qualify for non-recognition treatment, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition.\nIn connection with the Spin-Off, MTW received an opinion from its legal counsel, substantially to the effect, that the Spin-Off and certain related transactions will qualify as tax-free to MTW and its shareholders under Sections 355, 368 and related provisions of the Code, except to the extent of any cash received in lieu of fractional shares of MFS\u2019 common stock. Any such opinion is not binding on the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d). Accordingly, the IRS may reach conclusions with respect to the Spin-Off that are different from the conclusions reached in the opinion. The opinion relied on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from MTW and us regarding the past and future conduct of the companies\u2019 respective businesses and other matters, which, if incomplete, incorrect or not satisfied, could alter the conclusions of the party giving such opinion.\nIf the Spin-Off ultimately is determined to be a taxable event, the Spin-Off could be treated as a taxable dividend to MTW\u2019s shareholders at the time of the Spin-Off for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and MTW\u2019s shareholders could incur significant federal income tax liabilities. In addition, MTW would recognize a taxable gain to the extent that the fair market value of MFS\u2019 common stock exceeds MTW\u2019s tax basis in such stock on the date of the Spin-Off.\nGenerally, taxes resulting from the failure of the Spin-Off to qualify for non-recognition treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes would be imposed on MTW or MTW\u2019s shareholders and, under the Tax Matters Agreement, MTW is generally obligated to indemnify us against such taxes. However, under the Tax Matters Agreement, we could be required, under certain circumstances, to indemnify MTW and its affiliates against all tax-related liabilities caused by those failures, to the extent those liabilities result from an action we or our affiliates take or from any breach of our or our affiliates\u2019 representations, covenants or obligations under the Tax Matters Agreement or any other agreement we entered into in connection with the Spin-Off. Events triggering an indemnification obligation under the agreement include events occurring after the Distribution that cause MTW to recognize a gain under Section 355(e) of the Code. See \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Party Transactions, and Director Independence-Agreements with Tax Matters Agreement\u201d in Part III, Item 13 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe may not be able to engage in certain transactions after the Spin-Off.\nTo preserve the tax-free treatment of the Spin-Off, we and MTW entered into a Tax Matters Agreement that restricts us from taking any action that prevents the Distribution and related transactions from being tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Under the Tax Matters Agreement, for an agreed upon period following the Distribution, we are prohibited, except in certain circumstances, from:\n\u2022\nentering into any transaction resulting in the acquisition of above a certain percentage of our stock or substantially all of our assets, whether by merger or otherwise;\n\u2022\nmerging, consolidating or liquidating;\n\u2022\nissuing equity securities beyond certain thresholds;\n\u2022\nrepurchasing our capital stock; and\n\u2022\nceasing to actively conduct our business.\nThese restrictions may limit our ability to pursue certain strategic transactions or other transactions that we may believe to be in the best interests of our shareholders or that might increase the value of our business. In addition, under the Tax Matters Agreement, we will be required to indemnify MTW against any such tax liabilities as a result of the acquisition of our stock or assets, even if it did not participate in or otherwise facilitate the acquisition.\nWe may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve from the Spin-Off.\nWe believe that, as an independent, publicly traded company, we will be able, among other factors, to better focus our financial and operational resources on our specific business, growth profile and strategic priorities, design and implement corporate strategies and policies targeted to our operational focus and strategic priorities, streamline our processes and infrastructure to focus on our core strengths, implement and maintain a capital structure designed to meet our specific needs and more effectively respond to industry dynamics. However, we may be unable to achieve some or all of these benefits. In addition, completion of the Spin-Off has required and will continue to require significant amounts of management\u2019s time and effort, which may divert management\u2019s attention from operating and growing our businesses. If we fail to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve as an independent company, or do not achieve them in the time we expect, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may be unable to make, on a timely or cost-effective basis, the changes necessary to operate as an independent company.\nWe have historically operated as part of MTW\u2019s corporate organization, and MTW has assisted us by providing various corporate functions. Following the Spin-Off, MTW has no obligation to provide us with assistance other than the transition services described under \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Party Transactions, and Director Independence-Agreements with MTW-Transition Services Agreement\u201d in Part III, Item 13 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These services do not include every service we have received from MTW in the past, and MTW is only obligated to provide these services for limited periods from the date of the Spin-Off. Accordingly, we need to provide internally or obtain from unaffiliated third parties the services we currently receive from MTW. These services include information technology, finance, legal, insurance, compliance and human resources activities, the effective and appropriate performance of which is critical to our operations. We may be unable to replace these services in a timely manner or on terms and conditions as favorable as those we receive from MTW. In particular, MTW\u2019s information technology networks and systems are complex, and duplicating these networks and systems will be challenging. Because our business previously operated as part of the wider MTW organization, we may be unable to successfully establish the infrastructure or implement the changes necessary to operate independently, or we may incur additional costs that could adversely affect our business. If we fail to obtain the quality of administrative services necessary to operate effectively or incur greater costs in obtaining these services, our profitability, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe have no operating history as an independent, publicly traded company, and our historical financial information is not necessarily representative of the results we would have achieved as an independent, publicly traded company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results.\nWe derived the historical financial information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K from MTW\u2019s consolidated financial statements, and this information does not necessarily reflect the results of operations, financial position and cash flows we would have achieved as an independent, publicly traded company during the periods presented, or those that we will achieve in the future. This is primarily because of the following factors:\n\u2022\nPrior to the Spin-Off, we operated as part of MTW\u2019s broader corporate organization, rather than as an independent company. MTW performed part or all of various corporate functions for us, including information technology, finance, legal, insurance, compliance and human resources activities. Our historical financial information reflects allocations of corporate expenses from MTW for these and similar functions. These allocations may not reflect the costs we will incur for similar services in the future as an independent company.\n\u2022\nWe have entered into agreements and transactions with MTW that did not exist prior to the Spin-Off. See \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Party Transactions and Director Independence-Agreements with MTW\u201d in Part III, Item 13 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding these transactions.\n\u2022\nOur historical financial information does not reflect changes that we have experienced and we expect to experience in the future as a result of the Spin-Off, including changes in our cost structure, personnel needs, tax structure, financing and business operations. As part of MTW, we enjoyed certain benefits from MTW\u2019s operating diversity, size, purchasing power and available capital for investments, and we will lose these benefits after the Spin-Off. After the Spin-Off, as an independent entity, we may be unable to purchase goods, services and technologies, such as insurance and health care benefits and computer software licenses, on terms as favorable to us as those we obtained as part of MTW prior to the Spin-Off.\nFollowing the Spin-Off, we are also now responsible for the additional costs associated with being an independent, publicly traded company, including costs related to corporate governance, investor and public relations and public reporting. Therefore, our financial statements may not be indicative of our future performance as an independent company. While we have been profitable as part of MTW, we cannot assure you that our profits will continue at a similar level when we are a stand-alone company. For additional information about our past financial performance and the basis of presentation of our financial statements, see \u201cSelected Financial Data,\u201d \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and our historical combined financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCertain of our directors and officers may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their MTW equity ownership or their former MTW positions.\nCertain of our executive officers and directors have in the past been MTW officers, directors or employees and thus have professional relationships with MTW\u2019s executive officers, directors or employees. In addition, because of their former MTW positions, certain of our directors and executive officers own MTW common stock or options to acquire shares of MTW common stock, and the individual holdings may be significant for some of these individuals compared to their total assets.
