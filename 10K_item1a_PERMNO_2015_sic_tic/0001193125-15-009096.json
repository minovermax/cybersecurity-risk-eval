{"cik": "1289550", "company": "XENONICS HOLDINGS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-01-13", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our common stock is subject to a high degree of risk. The risks described below should be carefully considered, as well as the other information contained in this annual report. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations and business prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In such event, the trading price of our common stock would likely decline.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nUncertainty as a Going Concern.\nOur future existence remains uncertain and the report of our independent auditors on our financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2014 includes an explanatory paragraph relating to our ability to continue as a going concern. We have suffered substantial losses from operations and require additional financing. During the year ended September 30, 2014 the Company raised $1,426,000 of additional financing. Ultimately we need to generate additional revenues and attain profitable operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. There can be no assurance that we will be able to generate additional revenue or obtain additional financing.\nFluctuations in our quarterly and annual operating results make it difficult to assure future positive cash flows from operations.\nFor the most recent fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, we had a net loss of $2,597,000 on revenues of $830,000, compared to a net loss of $1,542,000 on revenues of $2,383,000 for the year ended September 30, 2013. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012, we had a net loss of $2,189,000 on revenues of $2,164,000. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2011, we had a net loss of $92,000 on revenues of $7,179,000. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2010, we had a net loss of $1,781,000 on revenues of $4,397,000. Since our revenues are primarily dependent upon the receipt of large orders from the military and other governmental organizations, for which orders are sporadic and unpredictable, our revenues fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year. No assurance can be given that we will generate sales at any specific levels or that any additional sales that may be generated will result in the profitability or viability of our Company.\nThe loss of contracts with U.S. government agencies would adversely affect our revenue.\nTo date, substantially all of our sales have been derived from sales to military and security organizations, such as the U.S. military, and various other governmental law enforcement agencies. While we believe that we will continue to be successful in marketing our products to these entities, there are certain considerations and limitations inherent in sales to governmental or municipal entities such as budgetary constraints, timing of procurement, political considerations, and listing requirements that are beyond our control and could affect our future sales. There is no assurance that we will be able to achieve our targeted sales objectives to these governmental and municipal entities or that we will continue to generate any material sales to these entities in the future.\nPotential customers may prefer our competitors\u2019 technology and products.\nThe ultra-high intensity lighting industry, in which we operate, is characterized by mature products and established industry participants. We compete with other providers of specialized lights in the United States and abroad who have created or are developing technologies and products that are similar to the products we are selling to many of the same purchasers in our targeted markets. Although we believe that our competitors do not offer products as advanced as ours, competition from these companies is intense. Because we are currently a small company with a limited marketing budget, our ability to compete effectively will depend on the benefits of our technology and on our patents. There is no assurance that potential customers will select our technology over that of a competitor, or that a competitor will not market a competing technology with operating characteristics similar to those owned by us.\nThe loss of any of our key personnel could adversely affect our business.\nWe depend on the efforts of our senior management, particularly Alan P. Magerman, our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer and Jeffrey P. Kennedy, our Chief Operating Officer and President. The loss of the services of one or both of these individuals could delay or prevent us from achieving our objectives.\nThe interests of our current shareholders will be diluted if we seek additional equity financing in the future, and any debt financing that we seek in the future will expose us to the risk of default and insolvency.\nWe are dependent on our ability to obtain sales orders and/or additional equity or debt financing to continue to support planned operations and satisfy obligations. The Company\u2019s marketing activity has been intensified and management remains optimistic about our growth opportunity. However, due to the nature of our business, there is no assurance that we will receive new orders during the quarters that we expect them. Although management believes it can obtain additional financing, there is no certainty that it can. Any equity financing may involve dilution of the interests of our current shareholders, and any debt financing would subject us to the risks associated with leverage, including the possible risk of default and insolvency.\nWe may experience production delays if suppliers fail to deliver materials to us, which could reduce our revenue.\nThe manufacturing process for our products consists primarily of the assembly of purchased components. Although we can obtain materials and purchase components from different suppliers, we rely on certain suppliers for our components. If a supplier should cease to deliver such components, this could result in added cost and manufacturing delays and have an adverse effect on our business.\nAny delay in our ability to market, sell or ship our existing products would adversely affect our revenue.\nTo date, all of our revenues have been generated from the sales of our NightHunter illumination system products - the NightHunter One, NightHunter II (now discontinued), NightHunter 3 and NightHunter ext - related accessories and SuperVision. In addition to the NightHunter models and SuperVision with tactical illumination, we are now marketing the NightHunter 3. The profitability and viability of our Company is dependent upon our continued ability to manufacture, sell and ship our illumination products and SuperVision, and any delay or interruption in our ability to market, sell, or ship our NightHunter illumination systems or SuperVision and related accessories will have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. However, the Company has never missed a required delivery date for orders received.\nFurther, our future growth and profitability will depend on our ability to successfully expand NightHunter, SuperVision and other products. While our goal is to develop and commercialize a line of ultra-high intensity illumination systems, and digital low-light viewing devices, new products will require substantial expenditures for development and advertising. There is no guarantee that the market will accept these new products. If we are unable to develop and release other products, the future of our Company will depend on the commercial success of our existing NightHunter products and SuperVision.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nYou may be unable to sell your shares at an adequate price or at all.\nThere is no assurance as to the depth or liquidity of any market for our common stock or the prices at which holders may be able to sell the shares. As a consequence, there may be periods of several days or more when trading activity in our shares is minimal or non-existent, as compared to a seasoned issuer which has a large and steady volume of trading activity that will generally support continuous sales without an adverse effect on share price. Due to these conditions, there is no assurance that shareholders will be able to sell their shares at or near ask prices or at all.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research reports about our business or if they downgrade our stock, the price of our common stock could decline.\nSmall, relatively unknown companies can achieve visibility in the trading market through research reports that industry or securities analysts publish. The lack of published reports by independent securities analysts could limit the interest in our common stock and negatively affect our stock price. We do not have any control over the research reports these analysts publish or whether they will be published at all. If any analyst who does cover us downgrades our stock, our stock price would likely decline. If any analyst ceases coverage of our Company or fails to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our articles of incorporation could adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nOur articles of incorporation contain certain provisions that could impede a non-negotiated change in control. In particular, without shareholder approval we can issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock with rights and preferences determined by the board of directors. These provisions could make a hostile takeover or other non-negotiated change in control difficult.\nThe future issuance of additional common and preferred stock could dilute existing shareholders.\nWe are currently authorized to issue up to 50,000,000 shares of common stock. To the extent that common shares are available for issuance, our board of directors has the ability, without seeking shareholder approval, to issue additional shares of common stock in the future for such consideration as the board of directors may consider sufficient. The issuance of additional common stock in the future will reduce the proportionate ownership and voting power of the common stock held by our existing shareholders. The Company can increase the number of authorized shares of common stock, but only with shareholder approval.\nWe are also authorized to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, the rights and preferences of which may be designated in series by the board of directors. Such designation of new series of preferred stock may be made without shareholder approval and could create additional securities which would have dividend and liquidation preferences over our common stock. Preferred shareholders could adversely affect the rights of holders of common stock by:\n\u2022\nexercising voting, redemption and conversion rights to the detriment of the holders of common stock;\n\u2022\nreceiving preferences over the holders of common stock or surplus funds in the event of our dissolution or liquidation;\n\u2022\ndelaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of our company; and\n\u2022\ndiscouraging bids for our common stock.\nWe do not plan to pay any cash dividends on our common stock.\nWe do not plan to pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Any decision to pay dividends is within the discretion of the board of directors and will depend upon our profitability at the time, cash available and other factors. As a result, there is no assurance that there will ever be any cash dividends or other distributions on our common stock.\nThe exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants would dilute the ownership interests of our existing shareholders.\nThere are currently outstanding stock options and warrants entitling the holders to purchase 10,674,000 shares of our common stock, including a number of options granted to directors, officers, employees and consultants that are subject to vesting and financial performance conditions. These options and warrants have exercise prices ranging from $0.12 per share to $0.65 per share. It is likely that many of the holders of these options and warrants will exercise and sell shares of our common stock when the stock price exceeds their exercise price. Substantial option and warrant exercises and subsequent stock sales by our option and warrant holders would significantly dilute the ownership interests of our existing shareholders.\nThe conversion of outstanding convertible debt would dilute the ownership interests of our existing shareholders.\nCurrently we have $981,000 of three-year convertible notes payable with interest at 13% per annum entitling note holders to purchase 14,014,000 shares of our common stock at $0.07 per share. It is likely that many of the note holders will exercise and sell shares of our common stock when the stock price exceeds their conversion price. Substantial conversions and subsequent stock sales by our note holders would significantly dilute the ownership interests of our existing shareholders.\nFuture sales of common stock by our existing shareholders and option and warrant holders could cause our stock price to decline.\nThe release into the public market of a large number of freely tradable shares and restricted securities that are now eligible or subsequently become eligible for public resale under Rule 144 could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. The perception among investors that these sales may occur could produce the same adverse effect on our market price.", "PERMNO": 90659, "SIC": 3640, "TIC": "XNNHQ"}
