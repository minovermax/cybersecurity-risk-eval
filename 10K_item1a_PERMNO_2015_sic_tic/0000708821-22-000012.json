RISK FACTORS\nOur business is subject to certain risks and uncertainties, including those described below, each of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, prospects and the market price of our common stock.\nRisks Associated with the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and its impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations remains uncertain.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the actions taken by governmental authorities, businesses, and individuals in response have resulted in weakened economic conditions, supply constraints and shortages, manufacturing disruptions and logistic challenges, and volatility in the financial markets, both in the United States and other countries. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition, and results of operations is dependent on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration and scope of the COVID-19 pandemic, the severity of COVID-19 variants and the actions, especially those taken by governmental authorities, to contain the pandemic or mitigate its impact, and the impact on the businesses of our customers, partners, and suppliers. Among the factors that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations, are:\n\u2022mandated business closures, or voluntary store closures or reduced services due to lower customer/guest demand or labor shortages;\n\u2022decreased product adoptions and bookings by customers or potential customers because of reduced profits or investment capital;\n\u2022delayed or canceled store implementations due to limited or no store access;\n\u2022customer payment delays or defaults and bankruptcies;\n\u2022supply shortages and/or disruptions in product manufacturing and distribution channels, which could severely restrict our access to source materials or component parts when required, expanding the impact of the supply shortage and possibly resulting in longer lead times for delivery, which could negatively impact our ability to satisfactorily and timely complete our customer obligations;\n\u2022price increases for materials and component parts and shipping and transportation costs, which has caused, and may continue to result in increased prices of our products and services, which could make us less competitive, result in reduced sales, loss of potential new customers, and cause damage to our reputation and relationships with our current customers; and\n\u2022operational challenges due to actions taken by us to support and protect our employees\u2019 health and safety, including limiting employee travel, limiting access to facilities and offices, implementing remote work and flexible work policies, and implementing policies responsive to government vaccine, masking and/or testing mandates. Remote employee work arrangements pose challenges for our employees and our IT systems, and stresses our business continuity plans, introduce operational risk, including cybersecurity and IT systems management risks, and impair our ability to manage our business and execute our strategies. Additionally, our business is dependent on attracting and retaining highly skilled employees, and our ability\nto attract and retain such employees may be adversely impacted by limited access to our facilities/offices, our travel restrictions, or our policies responsive to government mandates, which could result in increased competition for skilled talent, and could adversely impact our ability to deliver our products and services to our customers.\nFurther, the worldwide uncertainty, volatility, and economic disruption created by the COVID-19 pandemic, could exacerbate other risk factors that we identify in this Annual Report, any of which could materially adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Associated with the Operation of our Business\nWe have incurred losses in each of the last several years, and we expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future.\nWe have incurred operating losses in each of the last several years, including for the year ended December 31, 2021, and we expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future as we continue to invest in our Restaurant/Retail segment by, among other things, making substantial investments to grow the Company through the acquisition of other businesses and enhancing our products and services through research and development. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in achieving or sustaining profitability in the future. If we are unable to generate sufficient revenue to become profitable, investors could lose their investment.\nOur results of operations may fluctuate significantly due to the timing of our recognition of SaaS revenues.\nWe may experience volatility in our reported revenues and operating results due to the differences in timing of revenue recognition between our SaaS offerings and our traditional on-premise software and hardware sales. SaaS revenues are generally recognized ratably over the life of the subscriptions. In contrast, revenue from our on-premise software and hardware sales is generally recognized in full at the time of delivery. Accordingly, the SaaS delivery model creates risks related to the timing of revenue recognition not associated with our traditional on-premise software delivery model and hardware sales. A portion of our SaaS revenue results from the recognition of deferred revenue relating to subscription agreements entered into during prior reporting periods. A decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any period may not be immediately reflected in our reported financial results for that period, but may result in a decline in our revenue in future reporting periods. If any of our assumptions about revenue from our SaaS delivery model prove incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from those anticipated, estimated, or projected.\nOur products might experience coding or configuration errors, which could damage our reputation and deter current and potential customers from purchasing our products.\nAlthough we test our products and product updates prior to their release and throughout their intended life, our cloud-based and on-premise software and hardware products sometimes contain coding or configuration errors that can negatively impact their functionality, performance, operation, and integration capabilities. Coding and configuration errors can expose us to product liability, performance issues, warranty claims, and harm to our reputation, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our technical and maintenance support services are not satisfactory to our customers, they may not renew their services agreements or buy future products, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to provide technical and maintenance support services that are responsive, satisfy our customers\u2019 expectations, and timely resolve issues that they encounter with our products or if there is a perception that we do not maintain high quality technical and maintenance support, then our customers may not purchase additional products or services from us in the future, negatively affecting our revenues, which would have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThree customers account for a significant portion of our revenues in the Restaurant/Retail segment. The loss of one of these customers, or a significant reduction, delay, or cancellation of purchases by one of these customers, would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRevenues from our Restaurant/Retail segment constituted 74.4% of our total consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021. Aggregate sales to our three largest customers (which include sales to those three customers\u2019 respective franchisees) constituted consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 of 30.0%. Significant reductions, delays, or cancellation of orders by one of these customers, or the loss of one of these customers, would reduce our revenue and operating income and would materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nThere are risks related to our enterprise resource planning system.\nWe continue to integrate components onto our enterprise resource planning, or ERP, system which is intended to provide accurate, timely and reliable reports on our financial condition and results operations. Delays in fully integrating our ERP system can result in operational inefficiencies, including management and staff time to manage, coordinate, and execute unintegrated components, increased costs and can impair our ability to provide accurate, timely and reliable reports on our financial condition and operating results, which in turn would negatively impact our competitive position and customer relationships and harm our business.\nIssues with product and component availability or supplier performance may affect our ability to manufacture and deliver our products, which could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on our suppliers to deliver hardware and related materials, product assemblies, and components in a timely and satisfactory manner and in full compliance with contract terms and applicable laws and regulations. In some instances, we are dependent on sole-source suppliers for certain of our assembly components and hardware products, which may subject us to other significant risks, including higher prices, reduced control over inventory delivery schedules, or inadequate inventory. While we have entered into long-term or volume purchase agreements with some suppliers, have increased safety stock inventory and the use of alternative sources when possible, and have taken other actions to ensure the availability of needed materials, components, and products, we cannot be sure that hardware and related materials, product assemblies or components will be available or in the needed quantities and quality or at favorable or competitive prices. If we experience a material supplier problem it could lead to a shortage of supplies and extended lead times for delivery, which could negatively impact our ability to satisfactorily and timely complete our customer obligations. This could result in reduced sales, breach or termination of contracts, and damage to our reputation and relationships with our customers, which could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations\nCOVID-19 pandemic-related issues have created trade and shipping disruptions and port congestion, resulting in increased transportation costs for our hardware and related materials, product assemblies, and components. We continue to experience price increases for materials and component parts; while we have been able to obtain cost reductions and avoid unfavorable changes to terms with some of our suppliers, this is not the case with all of our suppliers, and we may not be successful in maintaining favorable terms or securing favorable terms from other suppliers in the future. To offset increased costs, we have and may in the future increase the prices of our products. These price increases could make us less competitive, result in reduced sales, loss of potential new customers, and cause damage to our reputation and relationships with our current customers, which could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur information technology systems or those of our service providers could be subject to cyber-attacks or other security incidents, which could result in operational disruptions, costly governmental investigations or litigation and other adverse consequences that could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have established practices, policies and procedures intended to protect our systems and information against cyber-attacks. We invest in the development and enhancement of our controls designed to prevent, detect, respond, and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses, and other events that could have a security impact. We also conduct security awareness trainings on at least an annual basis for our employees to educate them on how to identify and alert management to phishing emails, spoofed, or manipulated electronic\ncommunications, and other critical security threats. We also provide regular security bulletins to our employees, and we have policies and procedures in place designed to prevent cybersecurity attacks or identify threatened attacks. However, there can be no assurance that such measures will ultimately prevent or mitigate the impact of a cyber-attack on our systems or information. Our systems have and could in the future become subject to cyber-attacks, including computer viruses, dedicated denial of services attacks, malware, social engineering, and other means used to obtain unauthorized access to or disrupt the operation of our systems. We also rely on service providers, and we cannot guarantee that our service providers\u2019 systems have not been breached or that they do not contain exploitable defects, bugs, or vulnerabilities that could result in a security incident, or other disruption to, our or our service providers\u2019 systems. Our ability to monitor the security measures that our service providers have implemented is limited, and, in any event, malicious third parties may be able to circumvent those security measures.\nEven though prior incidents did not have a material adverse effect on our systems and operations, there can be no assurance that the same will be the case in the future. In particular, the shift to widespread remote working conditions increases the opportunities available to cybersecurity criminals, and, as such, the risk of a cyber-attack potentially occurring is increased. A failure or interruption of our systems or those of our service providers could result in operational disruptions, costly governmental investigations or litigation, unauthorized access, or misappropriation of information, interruption of systems availability or denial of access to and misuse of applications or information required by our customers to conduct their businesses. The occurrence of any such incidents may harm our relationship with our customers and reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe rely on public cloud providers and a network infrastructure managed by third parties to deliver our cloud software solutions, and any interruptions or delays in their services could harm our business.\nWe rely on public cloud providers and a network infrastructure managed by third parties to deliver our cloud software solutions. Our ability to deliver our cloud software solutions in a timely and reliable manner to our customers depends on the protection of the information we store with these public cloud providers, as well as the maintenance of the network infrastructure. Any interruptions or delays in the services provided by these public cloud providers or third-party network infrastructure, whether caused by natural disasters or malicious actors, may result in substantial service disruptions, which could damage our reputation with potential and existing customers, cause us to lose existing customers, expose us to liability, or otherwise harm our business. We may also incur significant costs for using alternative equipment to deliver our cloud software solutions or taking other actions to mitigate any prolonged service disruptions. Any such alternatives could be more difficult or costly to replace than what we currently license, and integration of the alternatives into our network could require significant work and resources and delays.\nA portion of our total assets consists of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, which are subject to a periodic impairment analysis. A significant impairment determination in any future period could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, even without a significant loss of revenue or increase in cash expenses attributable to such period.\nOur goodwill was approximately $457.3 million at December 31, 2021 and our intangibles were $118.8 million at December 31, 2021. Identifiable intangible assets are primarily a result of business acquisitions and internally developed capitalized software. We test our goodwill and identifiable intangible assets for impairment annually, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate possible impairment. We describe the impairment testing process and results of this testing more thoroughly in \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.\u201d Our estimates are subject to uncertainties. If we determine an impairment has occurred at any point in time, we will be required to reduce goodwill or identifiable intangible assets on our balance sheet, which could adversely impact our results of operations. Additional information about our impairment testing is contained in Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report).\nIf we are unable to recruit and retain qualified employees, our business may be harmed.\nCompetition for highly skilled employees in our industry is intense. In 2021, the labor market in the U.S. experienced a significant increase in workers leaving their positions, otherwise known as the \u201cGreat Resignation\u201d or the \u201cBig Quit,\u201d which has made the market to replace these individuals increasingly competitive and has resulted in\nsignificant wage inflation in response to labor shortages. If we are unable to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees, particularly senior management and technical personnel, we may not be able to keep up with the needs of our customers and our Restaurant/Retail segment and our reputation may be harmed. Moreover, many positions in our Government business require security clearances, which can be difficult and time-consuming to obtain, resulting in increased competition for such uniquely qualified individuals.\nWe may be subject to claims by third-parties of intellectual property and/or proprietary rights infringement.\nThird parties may assert claims that our software, systems or technology infringe, misappropriate, or otherwise violate their intellectual property or other proprietary rights. Third parties may also assert that our sale of certain products require the payment of license fees to them. Such claims may be made by our competitors seeking to obtain a competitive advantage or by other parties, including existing licensors. The risk of claims may increase as the number of software products that we offer, and competitors in our market increase and product technology and discovery overlaps occur. For example, in September 2020, we were notified by one of our business partners of a claim for non-payment of royalties due under an existing license agreement. We do not believe that this claim has any merit, but we allocated resources to resolve this claim. Any such claims, regardless of merit, resulting in litigation could result in substantial expenses, divert the attention of management, cause significant delays in introducing new or enhanced services or technology and materially disrupt the conduct of our business. We cannot assure you that litigation related to our intellectual property rights or the intellectual property rights of others can always be avoided or successfully concluded, and as a result any such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Associated with the Growth of our Business\nAcquisitions are an element of our growth strategy, which subject us to risks commonly associated with acquisitions of other business.\nA component of our growth strategy is to continue to expand through acquisitions that we believe add complementary companies, products, and technologies. Accordingly, we may be subject to risks that are commonly associated with the acquisition of other businesses, including:\n\u2022the failure to identify or successfully negotiate suitable future acquisitions;\n\u2022the failure to obtain financing on satisfactory terms;\n\u2022difficulties in obtaining required regulatory or stakeholder approvals;\n\u2022the inability to effectively translate our strategies into revenue;\n\u2022unforeseen costs or cost estimates that exceed our expectations in connection with integration of the acquired business;\n\u2022the failure to retain and assimilate acquired business\u2019 employees;\n\u2022difficulties coordinating and managing geographically separate organizations;\n\u2022the inability to retain existing customers and suppliers on terms similar to, or better than, those in place with the acquired business;\n\u2022the inadequacy of our integration plans;\n\u2022difficulties entering geographic markets or new market segments in which we have no or limited experience; and\n\u2022failure to maintain our financial and internal controls and systems as we expand our operations.\nIf we fail to realize anticipated benefits or synergies of the businesses we acquire, such as cost-savings and earnings accretion, or if we decrease our liquidity by using a significant portion of our available cash or borrowing capacity to finance acquisitions, incur additional indebtedness or issue additional equity securities to finance acquisitions or incur or assume unanticipated liabilities, losses or costs associated with the business acquired, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe face extensive competition in our markets, and our failure to compete effectively could result in price reductions and/or decreased demand for our products and services.\nThe markets for our software and hardware products are characterized by rapid technological advances, intense competition among existing and emerging competitors, evolving industry practices, disruptive technology\ndevelopments, and frequent new product introductions.\nWhile we think our software and hardware products offer competitive, innovative features and functionality, any one of these factors could create downward pressure on pricing and gross margins and could adversely affect sales to our existing customers, as well as our ability to attract and sell to new customers. Our future success depends on our ability to anticipate and identify changes in customer needs and/or relevant technologies, quickly respond to customer requirements, and rapidly and effectively introduce new and innovative products, features, and functions. If we fail in these efforts, our business, results of operations, and financial conditions could suffer. Any delay in the development, marketing, or launch of new products or enhancements to our existing products, or failure to meet our customers\u2019 requirements could result in reduced sales, performance penalties, or termination of contracts, and could damage our reputation and relationships with our customers and impede our ability to attract new customers, causing a decline in our revenue, earnings, or stock price and weakening our competitive position.\nOur Government segment has been focused on niche offerings reflecting its expertise, primarily in the areas of ISR, systems engineering and evaluation, satellite and telecommunications services, and management technology/systems services. Many of our competitors in the Government segment are larger and have substantially greater financial resources and broader capabilities in management technology. Our Government segment also competes with smaller companies, many of which are designated by the government for preferential \u201cset aside\u201d treatment, that target particular segments of the government market and may have superior capabilities in a particular segment. These companies may be better positioned to obtain contracts through competitive proposals. Consequently, there are no assurances we will continue to win government contracts as a prime contractor or subcontractor, and our failure to do so would reduce our revenue and operating income and could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nRisks Associated with our Convertible Senior Notes and Future Indebtedness\nWe may not have sufficient cash flow from our operating subsidiaries to pay our debt, which may seriously harm our business.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $398.8 million of aggregate principal amount outstanding under the 4.500% Convertible Senior Notes due 2024 (the \u201c2024 Notes\u201d), 2.875% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (the \u201c2026 Notes\u201d), and the 1.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2027 (the \u201c2027 Notes\u201d, and together with the 2024 Notes and 2026 Notes, the \u201cSenior Notes\u201d). Our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance the Senior Notes depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive, geopolitical, and other factors that may be beyond our control. If our operating subsidiaries are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt under the Senior Notes, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives to secure cash flow, such as selling assets or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to raise funds through debt or equity issuances and otherwise access the credit and capital markets at the times and in the amounts needed and on acceptable terms will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default under the indentures governing the Senior Notes.\nOur indebtedness under the Senior Notes, could, among other consequences:\n\u2022increase the impact of adverse changes in the U.S. and global markets - generally, and in our industries, on our business, financial condition and operating results;\n\u2022restrict or limit our agility to plan and react to changes in our business and our industries;\n\u2022place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors who have less debt; and\n\u2022limit our ability to borrow additional amounts to fund acquisitions, for working capital, and for other general corporate purposes.\nA conversion of the Senior Notes, or a fundamental change under the Senior Notes, if triggered, may materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf a fundamental change occurs, holders of the Senior Notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their Senior Notes in cash. Furthermore, upon conversion of any Senior Notes, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle the conversion (excluding cash in lieu of delivering fractional shares of our common stock), we must make cash payments in respect of the Senior Notes. Even if holders do not elect to\nconvert their Senior Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the Senior Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital. Any of the cash payments described above could be significant, and if we fail to repurchase the Senior Notes when required or deliver the consideration due upon conversion, we will be in default under the indentures governing the Senior Notes. In such an event of default, holders of the Senior Notes with the defaulted indebtedness could elect to declare all principal, together with accrued and unpaid interest, due and payable, which would materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Associated with the Regulation of our Business\nA failure to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn connection with our services and products, we may collect, process, transmit, and/or store (on our systems and those of service providers) customer transactional data, as well as their and our customers\u2019 and employees\u2019 personally identifiable information and/or other data and information. Personally identifiable information is subject to legislation and regulations in numerous jurisdictions with regard to privacy and data security, including the California Consumer Privacy Act and the New York SHIELD Act, which provide for fines and potential liability to consumers. Likewise, the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation, the GDPR, imposes obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect, analyze, and transfer personal data. Moreover, what constitutes personally identifiable information and what other data and/or information is subject to the privacy laws varies by jurisdiction and continues to evolve, and the laws that do reference data privacy continue to be interpreted by the courts and their applicability and reach are therefore uncertain. Ongoing compliance with these laws and regulations and additional efforts to ensure that our policies and procedures are updated to reflect changes in these laws and regulations are expensive and require significant resources. The lack of clarity and regulatory guidance on some issues further increases the cost of compliance. For example, Brexit, which took effect in January 2020, will lead to further legislative changes and reduced clarity as to whether data transfer to the United Kingdom will remain lawful in the long term, which may require us to expend additional resources to ensure that we are compliance with new rules or legislation. Our inability, or perceived inability, to adequately address privacy and data protection concerns, or comply with applicable laws, regulations, policies, or other legal obligations could damage our reputation, discourage current and/or potential customers from using our products and services, and result in fines, governmental investigations and/or enforcement actions, complaints by private individuals, and/or the payment of penalties to consumers, any one or all of which could have a material and adverse effect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting which could, if not remediated, impair our ability to report accurate and timely financial information and have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAs discussed in Part II, Item 9A. Controls and Procedures of this Annual Report, we reported that our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2021 due to material weaknesses related to the control activities component and monitoring activities component of the Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nIf we fail to correct our material weaknesses, or if we are unable to establish and maintain effective internal controls in the future, our ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information accurately could be adversely affected. This could cause our financial reporting to be unreliable and result in a restatement of our financial statements, which in turn could lead to a loss of investor confidence, a decline in the price of our common stock, and subject us to investigation or sanctions by the SEC. Any such consequence or other negative effect could have a material and adverse effect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to risks associated with our international operations, including compliance with international laws, which may harm our business.\nAlthough only 7.3%, 8.5%, and 6.4% of our total consolidated revenues were derived from sales outside of the U.S., in 2021, 2020, and 2019 respectively, we have operations across the globe, and our international operations subject us to a variety of risks and challenges, including:\n\u2022compliance with foreign laws and regulations, including anti-corruption laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and the U.K. Bribery Act, import and export control laws, and other regulatory or contractual limitations on our ability to sell our software and hardware in certain foreign markets, and the risks and costs of non-compliance with such laws and regulations, including fines, penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation;\n\u2022trade protection measures, including tariffs and sanctions (such as the higher tariffs on certain products imported from China enacted by the previous U.S. administration or U.S. sanctions against Russia as a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict);\n\u2022increased risks of unfair or corrupt business practices in certain geographies and of improper or fraudulent sales arrangements that may impact financial results and result in restatements of financial statements and irregularities in financial statements;\n\u2022reduced protection of our intellectual property rights in certain countries and practical difficulties and costs of enforcing those rights abroad;\n\u2022difficulties in managing staffing and exposure to different employment practices and labor laws;\n\u2022compliance with the laws of numerous foreign taxing jurisdictions and overlapping of different tax regimes;\n\u2022sales and customer service challenges associated with operating in different countries;\n\u2022difficulties in receiving payments from different geographies, including difficulties associated with currency fluctuations, payment cycles, transfer of funds, or collecting accounts receivable; and\n\u2022increased infrastructure and legal compliance costs.\nThese risks and challenges could result in an increase in our cost of doing business internationally, hardware or component shortages, shipping delays, longer payment cycles, increased taxes, and restrictions on the repatriation of funds to the U.S., any of which could negatively impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, our business is exposed to health epidemics (like the COVID-19 pandemic), war, terrorism, civil insurrection or social unrest, and other significant business interruptions that could lead to disruption, instability and volatility in the global economy and negatively impact us, and our suppliers, partners and customers. Further, we have employees in India and third-party consultants in Germany, Philippines, Ukraine, and other locations outside of the U.S. that provide software development and support services. A sustained loss of the software development services provided by international employees and third-party consultants could negatively impact our software development efforts, adversely affect our competitive position, harm our reputation, and negatively impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Associated with our Government Segment\nA portion of our Government segment revenue is derived from U.S. Government contracts, which contain provisions unique to public sector customers, including the U.S. Government\u2019s right to modify or terminate these contracts at any time.\nTotal consolidated revenues of 26% in 2021 were derived from contracts to provide technical expertise to government organizations and prime contractors. In any given year, the majority of our government contracting activity is associated with the U.S. Department of Defense. Contracts with the U.S. Government typically provide that such contracts are terminable, in whole or in part, at the convenience of the U.S. Government. If the U.S. Government terminates a contract on this basis, we would be entitled to receive payment for our allowable costs and, in general, a proportionate share of our fee or profit for work actually performed. Most U.S. Government contracts are also subject to modification or termination in the event of changes in funding. As such, we may perform work prior to formal authorization, or the contract prices may be adjusted for changes in scope of work. Termination or modification of a substantial number of our U.S. Government contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe perform work for various U.S. Government agencies and departments primarily pursuant to fixed-price, cost-plus fixed fee and time-and-material prime contracts and subcontracts. The majority of revenues derived from government contracts for the year ended December 31, 2021 were based on fixed-price or time and material contracts, with most of the remaining balance derived from cost-plus fixed fee contracts and a small portion derived from commercialized product licensing.\nWhile fixed-price contracts allow us to benefit from cost savings, they also expose us to the risk of cost overruns. If the initial estimates we use for calculating the contract price are incorrect, we can incur losses on those\ncontracts. In addition, some of our governmental contracts have provisions relating to cost controls, and audit rights and if we fail to meet the terms specified in those contracts, then we may not realize the full benefit of the contracts. Lower earnings caused by cost overruns would have an adverse effect on our financial results.\nUnder time and materials contracts, we are paid for labor at negotiated hourly billing rates and for certain expenses. Under cost-plus fixed fee contracts, we are reimbursed for allowable costs and paid a fixed fee. If our costs under either of these types of contracts were to exceed the contract ceiling, or are not allowable under the provisions of the contract or applicable regulations, we may not be reimbursed for 100% of our associated costs. Our inability to control our costs under either a time-and-materials contract or a cost-plus fixed fee contract could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. Cost overruns also may adversely affect our ability to sustain existing programs and obtain future contract awards.\nOur Government segment could be adversely affected by changes in budgetary priorities of the U.S. Government, failure to approve U.S. Government budgets on a timely basis, or delays in contract awards and other procurement activities.\nOur Government segment depends upon continued U.S. Government expenditures on defense, intelligence, homeland security, and other programs that we support. Changes in U.S. Government budgetary priorities, a significant decline in government expenditures, or a shift of expenditures away from programs that we support could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, in years when Congress does not complete our budget process before the end of our fiscal year (September 30), government operations are funded through a continuing resolution (\u201cCR\u201d) that temporarily funds federal agencies. Recent CRs have generally provided funding at the levels provided in the previous fiscal year. When the U.S. Government operates under a CR, it may delay funding we expect to receive from customers on work we are already performing and will likely result in new initiatives being delayed or in some cases canceled, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.\nFailure to comply with a variety of complex procurement regulations could result in liability for various penalties or sanctions including termination of U.S. Government contracts, disqualification from bidding on future U.S. Government contracts, and suspension or debarment from U.S. Government contracting.\nOur Government segment is subject to various laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration, and performance of U.S. Government contracts, which affect how we do business with our customers and increase our performance costs. Among the most significant laws and regulations are:\n\u2022the Federal Acquisition Regulation (\u201cFAR\u201d) and agency regulations supplemental to the FAR, which comprehensively regulate the formation, administration, and performance of U.S. Government contracts;\n\u2022the Truth in Negotiations Act, which requires certification and disclosure of all cost and pricing data in connection with contract negotiations;\n\u2022the Cost Accounting Standards and Cost Principles, which impose accounting requirements that govern our right to reimbursement under certain cost-based U.S. Government contracts;\n\u2022compliance with the FCPA or U.S. export control regulations, which apply when we engage in international work; and\n\u2022laws, regulations, and executive orders restricting the use and dissemination of information classified for national security purposes and the export of certain products and technical data.\nFailure to comply with these or other laws and regulations could result in contract termination, loss of security clearances, suspension or debarment from contracting with the U.S. Government, civil and/or criminal fines, and penalties. Any such consequences could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.\nWe cannot guarantee that our Government segment's estimated contract backlog will result in actual revenue.\nOur backlog consists of funded backlog, which is based on amounts actually committed by a customer for payment for goods and services, and unfunded backlog, which is based upon contract revenue we have the potential to earn over the remaining life of the contracts. Our backlog may not result in actual revenue in any\nparticular period, or at all, which could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. There is a higher degree of risk with respect to unfunded backlog. The actual receipt and timing of any revenue is subject to various contingencies, many of which are beyond our control. The actual receipt of revenue on contracts included in backlog may never occur or may change because a program schedule could change; the program could be canceled; a contract could be reduced, modified, or terminated early; or an option that we had assumed could not be exercised. Further, while many of our U.S. Government contracts require performance over a period of years, Congress often appropriates funds for these contracts for only one year at a time. Consequently, our contracts typically are only partially funded at any point during their term, and all or some of the work intended to be performed under the contracts will remain unfunded pending subsequent Congressional appropriations and the obligation of additional funds to the contract by the procuring agency. Our estimates are based on our experience under such contracts and similar contracts. However, there can be no assurances that all, or any, of such estimated contract backlog will be recognized as revenue.\nThe U.S. Government may revise its procurement or other practices in a manner adverse to our Government segment.\nThe U.S. Government may revise its procurement practices or adopt new contracting rules and regulations, such as cost accounting standards. It could also adopt new contracting methods relating to GSA contracts, Governmentwide Acquisition Contracts, or other multi-award contracts, or adopt new standards for contract awards intended to achieve certain social or other policy objectives. In addition, the U.S. Government may face restrictions from new legislation or regulations, as well as pressure from U.S. Government employees and their unions, on the nature and amount of services the U.S. Government may obtain from private contractors. These changes could impair our ability to obtain new contracts or contracts under which we currently perform when those contracts are up for recompete. Any new contracting methods could be costly or administratively difficult for us to implement, and as a result, could harm our financial condition and results of operations. A realignment of funds with changed U.S. Government priorities, including \u201cinsourcing\u201d of previously contracted support services, and the realignment of funds to other non-defense-related programs may reduce the amount of funds available to defense-related and other programs in our core service areas.\nOur Government segment is subject to reviews, audits, and cost adjustments by the U.S. Government, which, if unfavorably resolved to us, could adversely affect our profitability, cash flows, or growth prospects.\nU.S. Government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency, or DCAA, and the Defense Contract Management Agency, or DCMA, routinely audit and investigate government contracts and government contractors\u2019 administrative processes and systems. These agencies review our performance on contracts, pricing practices, cost structure, and compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and standards. They also evaluate the adequacy of internal controls over our business systems, including our purchasing, accounting, estimating, earned value management, and government property systems. Any costs found to be improperly allocated or assigned to contracts will not be reimbursed, and any such costs already reimbursed must be refunded and certain penalties may be imposed. Moreover, if any of the administrative processes and systems are found not to comply with requirements, we may be subjected to increased government scrutiny and approval that could delay or otherwise adversely affect our ability to compete for or perform contracts or collect our revenue in a timely manner. Therefore, an unfavorable outcome of an audit by the DCAA or another U.S. Government agency could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. If a government investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeitures of profits, suspension of payments, fines, and suspension or debarment from doing business with the federal government. In addition, we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us. Each of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.\nRisks Associated with Ownership of our Common Stock\nWe have never paid cash dividends on our common stock, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends.\nWe currently do not plan to declare dividends on shares of our common stock in the foreseeable future and plan to, instead, retain any earnings to finance our operations and growth. Because we have never paid cash dividends and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, the only opportunity to achieve a return on an investor\u2019s investment in our company will be if the market price of our common stock appreciates and the investor sells its shares at a profit. There is no guarantee that the price of our common stock that will prevail in the market will ever exceed the price that an investor pays.\nFuture sales of our common stock or other securities could depress the price of our common stock and could result in dilution to our existing security holders.\nWe may issue and sell additional shares of common stock or other securities in the future to raise capital or issue securities for other purposes, including in connection with acquisitions of other businesses or other strategic transactions. Transactions involving newly issued common stock or other securities convertible into our common stock, if converted, could result in dilution, possibly substantial, to our existing security holders.\nThe price of our common stock may be negatively impacted by factors that are unrelated to our actual operating performance.\nThe stock market in general is subject to fluctuations that affect the share prices and trading volumes of many companies, and these broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Factors that could affect our common stock price include:\n\u2022uncertainties, volatility, and economic disruption created by the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, our customers, the restaurant/retail industries generally, and the global economy;\n\u2022actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and results of operations;\n\u2022the performance and prospects of our major customers;\n\u2022our quarterly or annual financial results or those of other companies in the restaurant/retail industries;\n\u2022the lack of earnings guidance;\n\u2022investor perception of us and the industries in which we operate;\n\u2022uncertainty regarding domestic and international civil, political and economic conditions, including war and terrorism; and\n\u2022uncertainty regarding the prospects of domestic and foreign economies.\nIf securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they issue unfavorable commentary or negative recommendations with respect to our common stock, the price of our common stock, and consequently the market price for the Notes, could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that equity research and other securities analysts publish about us, our business, and the industries in which we operate. We do not have control over these analysts. Analysts could issue negative recommendations with respect to our common stock or publish other unfavorable commentary or cease publishing reports about our common stock, our business, or the industries in which we operate. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us, we could lose visibility in the market. As a result of one or more of these factors, the market price of our common stock could decline rapidly and our common stock trading volume could be adversely affected.\nOur bylaws designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could discourage lawsuits against us and our directors and officers.\nOur bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for:\n\u2022any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf;\n\u2022any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, employees, or agents to us or our stockholders;\n\u2022any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \u2018\u2018DGCL\u2019\u2019) or our certificate of incorporation or bylaws; or\n\u2022any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine.\nThis exclusive forum provision does not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act. It could apply, however, to a suit that falls within one or more of the categories set forth in the exclusive forum provision and that also asserts claims under the Securities Act, inasmuch as Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. There is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce this provision with respect to claims under the Securities Act, and our stockholders cannot waive compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law may discourage a takeover of our company.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain certain provisions that may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in our management or control over us. For example, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, collectively:\n\u2022authorize the issuance of undesignated preferred stock that could be issued by our board of directors to thwart a takeover attempt;\n\u2022provide that vacancies on our board of directors, including vacancies resulting from an enlargement of our board of directors, may be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office;\n\u2022permits only the board of directors, or the chairman of the board of directors or the president pursuant to a resolution approved by a majority of the then authorized number of our directors to call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022prohibit stockholder action by written consent except by unanimous written consent of all stockholders; and\n\u2022establish advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for elections as directors or to bring other business before an annual meeting of our stockholders.\nThese provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control, even though a majority of stockholders may consider such proposal, if effected, desirable. Such provisions could also make it more difficult for third parties to remove and replace the members of our board of directors. Moreover, these provisions may inhibit increases in the market price of our common stock that may result from takeover attempts or speculation.", "PERMNO": 61146, "SIC": 3578, "TIC": "PAR"}
