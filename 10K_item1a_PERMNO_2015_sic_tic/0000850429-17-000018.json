{"cik": "850429", "company": "TREDEGAR CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-02-22", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nThere are a number of risks and uncertainties that could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. The following risk factors should be considered, in addition to the other information included in this Form 10-K, when evaluating Tredegar and its businesses:\nPE Films\n\u2022\nPE Films is highly dependent on sales associated with its top five customers, the largest of which is P&G. PE Films\u2019 top five customers comprised approximately 29%, 32% and 38% of Tredegar\u2019s consolidated net sales from continuing operations, in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, with net sales to P&G alone comprising approximately 16%, 19% and 24% in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The loss or significant reduction of sales associated with one or more of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business. Other factors that could adversely affect the business include, by way of example, (i) failure by a key customer to achieve success or maintain share in markets in which they sell products containing PE Films\u2019 materials, (ii) key customers rolling out products utilizing technologies developed by others that replace PE Films\u2019 business with such customer, (iii) delays in a key customer rolling out products utilizing new technologies developed by PE Films and (iv) operational decisions by a key customer that result in component substitution, inventory reductions and similar changes. While PE Films has undertaken efforts to expand its customer base, there can be no assurance that such efforts will be successful, or that they will offset any delay or loss of sales and profits associated with these large customers.\nIn recent years, PE Films lost substantial sales volume due to product transitions and suffered other sales losses associated with various customers (see further discussion in the Executive Summary, PE Films section).\nPE Films anticipates further exposure to product transitions and lost business in certain personal care and surface protection materials that could negatively affect future operating profit from ongoing operations by, in the case of personal care materials, approximately $10 million annually, possibly beginning after 2018, and in the case of surface protection materials, estimated to be in the range of up to $5 to $10 million, although the timing and ultimate amount of the possible transitions for surface protection are uncertain. While it continues to identify new business opportunities with its existing customers, PE Films is also working to expand its customer base in order to create long-term growth and profitability by actively competing for new business with various customers across its full product portfolio and introducing new products and/or improvements to existing applications. There is no assurance that these efforts to expand the revenue base and mitigate this or any future loss of sales and profits from significant customers will be successful.\n\u2022\nPE Films depends on its ability to develop and deliver new products at competitive prices. Personal Care, Surface Protection and Bright View applications are now being made with a variety of new innovative materials and the overall cycle for bringing new films products to market has accelerated. While PE Films has substantial technological resources, there can be no assurance that its new products can be brought to market successfully, or if brought to market successfully, at the same level of profitability and market share of replaced films. The competitive dynamics in the personal care business require continuous development of new materials for customers. The product development process for personal care materials, which spans from idea inception to product commercialization, is typically 24 to 48 months. A shift in customer preferences away from PE Films\u2019 technologies, its inability to develop and deliver new profitable products, or delayed acceptance of its new products in domestic or foreign markets, could have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In the long term, growth will depend on PE Films\u2019 ability to provide innovative products at a price that meets the customers\u2019 needs.\n\u2022\nPE Films and its customers operate in highly competitive markets. PE Films competes on product innovation, quality, price and service, and its businesses and their customers operate in highly competitive markets. Global market conditions continue to exacerbate the Company\u2019s exposure to margin compression due to competitive forces, especially as certain products move into the later stages of their product life cycles. While PE Films continually works to identify new business opportunities with existing and new customers, primarily through the development of new products with improved performance and/or cost characteristics, there can be no assurances that such efforts will be successful, or that they will offset business lost from competitive dynamics or customer product transitions.\n\u2022\nFailure of PE Films\u2019 customers, who are subject to cyclical downturns, to achieve success or maintain market share could adversely impact PE Films\u2019 sales and operating margins. PE Films\u2019 plastic films serve as components for various consumer products sold worldwide. A customer\u2019s ability to successfully develop, manufacture and market those products is integral to PE Films\u2019 success. In addition, many customers are in industries that are cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in general economic conditions. During weak economic cycles, consumers of premium products made with or using PE Films\u2019 components may shift to less premium, less expensive products, reducing the demand for PE Films\u2019 plastic films. Cyclical downturns may negatively affect businesses that use PE Films\u2019 plastic film products, which could adversely affect sales and operating margins.\n\u2022\nThe Company\u2019s inability to protect its intellectual property rights or its infringement of the intellectual property rights of others could have a material adverse impact on PE Films. PE Films operates in an industry where its significant customers and competitors have substantial intellectual property portfolios. The continued success of PE Films\u2019 business depends on its ability not only to protect its own technologies and trade secrets, but also to develop and sell new products that do not infringe upon existing patents or threaten existing customer relationships. Intellectual property litigation is very costly and could result in substantial expense and diversions of Company resources, both of which could adversely affect its consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, there may be no effective legal recourse against infringement of the Company\u2019s intellectual property by third parties, whether due to limitations on enforcement of rights in foreign jurisdictions or as a result of other factors. An unfavorable outcome in any intellectual property litigation or similar proceeding could have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of PE Films.\n\u2022\nAn unstable economic environment could have a disruptive impact on PE Films\u2019 supply chain. Certain raw materials used in manufacturing PE Films\u2019 products are sourced from single suppliers, and PE Films may not be able to quickly or inexpensively re-source from other suppliers. The risk of damage or disruption to its supply chain may increase if and when different suppliers consolidate their product portfolios or experience financial distress. Failure to take adequate steps to effectively manage such events, which are intensified when a product is procured from a single supplier or location, could adversely affect PE Films\u2019 consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, as well as require additional resources to restore its supply chain.\n\u2022\nOur restructuring activities and cost saving initiatives may not achieve the results we anticipate. PE Films has undertaken and will continue to undertake restructuring activities and cost reduction initiatives to consolidate certain domestic production, improve operating efficiencies and generate cost savings. PE Films cannot be certain that it will be able to complete these initiatives as planned or that the estimated operating efficiencies or cost savings from such activities will be fully realized or maintained over time. In addition, PE Films may not be successful in moving production to other facilities or timely qualifying new production equipment. Failure to complete these initiatives could adversely affect PE Films\u2019 financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFlexible Packaging Films\n\u2022\nUncertain economic conditions in Brazil and overcapacity in Latin American polyester film production could adversely impact the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of Flexible Packaging Films. Flexible Packaging Films and its customers operate in a highly competitive global market for polyester films. Competition in Brazil, Terphane\u2019s primary market, has been exacerbated by global overcapacity in the polyester industry, in general, and by particularly acute overcapacity in Latin America. Additional PET capacity from a competitor in Latin America is expected to come on line in the second quarter of 2017. In addition, Flexible Packaging Films operations have been adversely impacted by ongoing unfavorable economic and political conditions in Brazil, which accounted for approximately 52% of its overall sales in 2016. These combined factors have resulted in significant competitive pricing pressures and U.S. Dollar equivalent margin compression. Moreover, variable conversion, fixed conversion and general, sales and administrative (\u201cGS&A\u201d) costs for operations in Brazil (\u201cOperating Costs\u201d) are expected to be adversely impacted by inflation that is higher than in the U.S. The possible offsetting impact on U.S. Dollar equivalent Operating Costs from higher Brazilian Real inflation of depreciation in the value of the Real relative to the U.S. Dollar (i.e., purchasing power parity) may not occur. There are many economic variables impacting currency exchange rates, and the Real could appreciate in value relative to the U.S. Dollar despite higher inflation resulting in U.S. Dollar equivalent Operating Costs being adversely affected by both higher Real inflation and Real appreciation. Accordingly, the U.S. Dollar equivalent pricing/product margins related to the underlying Operating Costs may not move in the same direction with the combined result being a whipsaw of the U.S. Dollar equivalent operating profit for Flexible Packaging Films.\nTredegar has attempted to mitigate these impacts through new product offerings, cost saving measures and manufacturing efficiency initiatives, but these efforts to-date have not been sufficient to prevent a significant decline in the operating profit for Flexible Packaging Films since the acquisition of Terphane in October 2011 and continuing efforts may not be\nsuccessful, which could further adversely impact Flexible Packaging Films\u2019 financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\u2022\nGovernmental failure to extend anti-dumping duties in Brazil on imported products or prevent competitors from circumventing such duties could adversely impact Flexible Packaging Films. In recent years, excess global capacity in the industry has led to increased competitive pressures from imports into Brazil. The Company believes that these conditions have shifted the competitive environment from a regional to a global landscape and have driven price convergence and lower product margins for Flexible Packaging Films. Recent favorable anti-dumping rulings have been issued against China, Egypt and India. Competitors not currently subject to anti-dumping duties may choose to utilize their excess capacity by selling product in Brazil, which may result in pricing pressures that Flexible Packaging Films may not be able to offset with cost savings measures and/or manufacturing efficiency initiatives. There can be no assurance that efforts to impose anti-dumping constraints on these competitors will be successful.\nAluminum Extrusions\n\u2022\nSales volume and profitability of Aluminum Extrusions is seasonal and cyclical and highly dependent on economic conditions of end-use markets in the U.S., particularly in the construction sector. Aluminum Extrusions\u2019 end-use markets can be subject to seasonality as well as large cyclical swings in volume. Because of the capital intensive nature and level of fixed costs inherent in the aluminum extrusions business, the percentage drop in operating profits in a cyclical downturn will likely exceed the percentage drop in volume. In addition, during an economic slowdown, excess industry capacity often drives increased pricing pressure in many end-use markets as competitors protect their position with key customers. Any benefits associated with cost reductions and productivity improvements may not be sufficient to offset the adverse effects on profitability from pricing and margin pressure and higher bad debts (including a greater chance of loss associated with customers defaulting on fixed-price forward sales contracts) that usually accompany a downturn. In addition, higher energy costs can further reduce profits unless offset by price increases or cost reductions and productivity improvements.\n\u2022\nFailure to extend anti-dumping and countervailing duties on imported products or prevent competitors from circumventing such duties, or a reduction in such duties, could adversely impact Aluminum Extrusions. In years prior to 2011, imports into the U.S., primarily from China, represented an increasing portion of the U.S. aluminum extrusion market. However, due to an affirmative determination by the U.S. International Trade Commission in April 2011 that asserted that dumped and subsidized imports of aluminum extrusion from China unfairly and negatively impacted the domestic industry, the U.S. Department of Commerce has applied anti-dumping and countervailing duties to these imported products. As a result, aluminum extrusion imports from China have decreased significantly. While the risk to the domestic industry had been abated for a period of time, these protective duties were scheduled to expire in November 2016 but have been extended until a hearing can be held and a subsequent decision can be made on further extending the duties. A final decision on extending these duties is expected in March 2017. There are ongoing efforts within the U.S. aluminum extrusions industry supporting the extension of these protective duties. Chinese and other overseas manufacturers continue to try to circumvent anti-dumping duties, by both legal and illegal means. An unfavorable outcome on the continuation of U.S. anti-dumping duties, or a failure by U.S. trade officials to curtail efforts to circumvent those duties, could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of Aluminum Extrusions.\n\u2022\nCompetition from China could increase significantly if China is granted market economy status by the World Trade Organization. As of December 11, 2016 China\u2019s automatic status as a non-market economy under World Trade Organization rules ended. As a result, China believes with respect to all Chinese-made products that it should receive market economy status and the rights attendant to that status under World Trade Organization rules. The United States and the European Union have each rejected that interpretation with respect to at least certain products, and are expected to do so with respect to aluminum extrusions. If China is granted market economy status by the United States government with respect to aluminum extrusions, that would likely create substantial pricing pressure on Aluminum Extrusions products and could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of Aluminum Extrusions.\n\u2022\nThe markets for Aluminum Extrusions\u2019 products are highly competitive with product quality, service, delivery performance and price being the principal competitive factors. Aluminum Extrusions has approximately 1,500 customers that are in a variety of end-use markets within the broad categories of building and construction, distribution, automotive and other transportation, machinery and equipment, electrical and consumer durables. No single customer exceeds 4% of Aluminum Extrusions\u2019 net sales. Future success and prospects depend on its ability to provide superior service, high quality products, timely delivery and competitive pricing to retain existing customers and participate in overall industry cross-cycle growth. Failure in any of these areas could lead to a loss of customers, which could have an adverse material effect on the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of Aluminum Extrusions.\n\u2022\nAluminum Extrusions may not have sufficient capacity to meet its growth targets and service all of its customers. In recent years, increased demand, primarily from the nonresidential building and construction sector, has pushed Aluminum Extrusions\u2019 average capacity utilization in excess of 90%. Aluminum Extrusions\u2019 ability to grow and service existing customers is closely tied to having sufficient capacity.\n\u2022\nAluminum Extrusions\u2019 efforts to expand the Company\u2019s presence in the automotive market may not be successful. Aluminum Extrusions has made significant capital investments in recent years to increase sales to automotive and light truck tier suppliers. Efforts to expand product offerings and broaden the customer base are tied to successfully substituting the Company\u2019s aluminum extrusions for current market alternatives. New Corporate Average Fuel Economy (\u201cCAFE\u201d) standards requiring material improvements in the automotive and light truck MPG (miles per gallon) by 2025, are expected to increase demand for lighter materials used in the vehicle\u2019s body, some of which can be supplied by Aluminum Extrusions. If the demand does not increase and/or the alternative products offered by Aluminum Extrusions are not accepted by its customers or if CAFE standards are reduced or delayed, Aluminum Extrusions may not generate expected returns on its capital investments, which could have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nGeneral\n\u2022\nTredegar has an underfunded defined benefit (pension) plan. Tredegar sponsors a pension plan that covers certain hourly and salaried employees in the U.S. The plan was substantially frozen to new participants in 2007, and frozen to benefit accruals for active participants in 2014. As of December 31, 2016, the plan was underfunded under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) measures by $88.6 million. Tredegar expects that it will be required to make a cash contribution of approximately $5.5 million to its underfunded pension plan in 2017, and may be required to make higher cash contributions in future periods depending on the level of interest rates and investment returns on plan assets.\n\u2022\nAn impairment of our long-lived intangible assets, including goodwill, could have a material non-cash adverse impact on our results of operations. As of December 31, 2016, reporting units in PE Films and Aluminum Extrusions carried goodwill balances of $104.1 million and $13.7 million, respectively. PE Films\u2019 goodwill balance was carried by its operating units, Personal Care Films and Surface Protection Films, at $46.8 million and $57.3 million, respectively. The Company assesses goodwill for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable, or, at a minimum, on an annual basis. The valuation of goodwill depends on a variety of factors, including the success in achieving the Company\u2019s business goals, global market and economic conditions, earnings growth and expected cash flows, and goodwill impairment valuations can be sensitive to assumptions associated with such factors. Failure to successfully achieve projections could result in future impairments. Impairments to goodwill and other intangible assets may also be caused by factors outside the Company\u2019s control, such as increasing competitive pricing pressures, changes in foreign exchange rates, lower than expected sales and profit growth rates, and various other factors. Significant and unanticipated changes could require a non-cash charge for impairment in a future period, which may significantly affect the Company\u2019s results of operations in the period of such charge.\n\u2022\nNoncompliance with any of the covenants in the Company\u2019s $400 million secured revolving credit facility, which matures in March of 2021, could result in all debt under the agreement outstanding at such time becoming due and limiting its borrowing capacity, which could have a material adverse effect on consolidated financial condition and liquidity. The credit agreement governing Tredegar\u2019s secured revolving credit facility contains restrictions and financial covenants that, if violated, could restrict the Company\u2019s operational and financial flexibility. Failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default, which if not cured or waived, would result in all outstanding debt under the credit facility at such time becoming due, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial condition and liquidity.\n\u2022\nTredegar\u2019s performance is influenced by costs incurred by its operating companies, including, for example, the cost of raw materials and energy. These costs include, without limitation, the cost of resin (the raw material on which PE Films primarily depends), PTA and MEG (the raw materials on which Flexible Packaging Films primarily depends), aluminum (the raw material on which Aluminum Extrusions primarily depends), natural gas (the principal fuel necessary for Aluminum Extrusions\u2019 plants to operate), electricity and diesel fuel. Resin, aluminum and natural gas prices are extremely volatile as shown in the charts in the Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures section. The Company attempts to mitigate the effects of increased costs through price increases and contractual pass-through provisions, but there are no assurances that higher prices can effectively be passed through to customers or that Tredegar will be able to offset fully or on a timely basis the effects of higher raw material and energy costs through price increases or pass-through arrangements. Further, the Company\u2019s cost control efforts may not be sufficient to offset any increases in raw material, energy or other costs.\n\u2022\nTredegar is subject to credit risk that is inherent with efforts to increase market share as the Company attempts to broaden its customer base. In the event of the deterioration of operating cash flows or diminished borrowing capacity of Tredegar\u2019s customers, the collection of trade receivable balances may be delayed or deemed unlikely. The Company\u2019s credit risk exposure could increase as business is expanded, including on export sales which generally have longer payment terms than domestic sales. In addition, the operations of the customers for Aluminum Extrusions generally follow the cycles within the economy, resulting in increased credit risk from diminished operating cash flows and greater risk of bankruptcy when the economy is deteriorating or in recession. In addition, difficult economic conditions in Brazil have resulted in increased credit risk to Flexible Packaging from customers whose businesses are detrimentally affected by those conditions.\n\u2022\nTredegar may not be able to successfully identify, complete or integrate strategic acquisitions. From time to time, the Company evaluates acquisition candidates that fit its business objectives. Acquisitions, including our recent acquisition of Futura, involve special risks, including, without limitation, meeting revenue, margin, working capital and capital expenditure expectations that substantially drive valuation, diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from existing businesses, the potential assumption of unanticipated liabilities and contingencies and potential difficulties in integrating acquired businesses and achieving anticipated operational improvements. Acquired businesses may not achieve expected results.\n\u2022\nTredegar is subject to various environmental laws and regulations and could become exposed to material liabilities and costs associated with such laws. The Company is subject to various environmental obligations and could become subject to additional obligations in the future. Changes in environmental laws and regulations, or their application, including, but not limited to, those relating to global climate change, could subject Tredegar to significant additional capital expenditures and operating expenses. Moreover, future developments in federal, state, local and international environmental laws and regulations are difficult to predict. Environmental laws have become and are expected to continue to become increasingly strict. As a result, Tredegar expects to be subject to new environmental laws and regulations. However, any such changes are uncertain and, therefore, it is not possible for the Company to predict with certainty the amount of additional capital expenditures or operating expenses that could be necessary for compliance with respect to any such changes. See Government Regulation in \u201cItem 1. Business\u201d for a further discussion of this risk factor.\n\u2022\nMaterial disruptions at one of the Company\u2019s major manufacturing facilities could negatively impact financial results. Tredegar believes its facilities are operated in compliance with applicable local laws and regulations and that the Company has implemented measures to minimize the risks of disruption at its facilities. Such a disruption could be a result of any number of events, including but not limited to: an equipment failure with repairs requiring long lead times, labor stoppages or shortages, utility disruptions, constraints on the supply or delivery of critical raw materials, and severe weather conditions. A material disruption in one of the Company\u2019s operating locations could negatively impact production and its consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\u2022\nAn information technology system failure may adversely affect the business. Tredegar relies on information technology systems to transact its business. An information technology system failure due to computer viruses, internal or external security breaches, cybersecurity attacks, power interruptions, hardware failures, fire, natural disasters, human error, or other causes could disrupt its operation and prevent it from being able to process transactions with its customers, operate its manufacturing facilities, and properly report transactions in a timely manner. A significant, protracted information technology system failure may adversely affect Tredegar\u2019s results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.\n\u2022\nAn inability to renegotiate the Company\u2019s collective bargaining agreements could adversely impact its consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Some of the Company\u2019s employees are represented by labor unions under various collective bargaining agreements with varying durations and expiration dates. Tredegar may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate collective bargaining agreements when they expire, which could result in strikes or work stoppages or higher labor costs. In addition, existing collective bargaining agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage at the Company\u2019s facilities in the future. Any such work stoppages (or potential work stoppages) could negatively impact Tredegar\u2019s ability to manufacture its products and adversely affect its consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\u2022\nTredegar\u2019s valuation of its $7.5 million cost-basis investment in kal\u00e9o is volatile and uncertain. Tredegar uses the fair value method to account for its ownership interest of approximately 19% in kaleo, Inc. (\u201ckal\u00e9o\u201d), a privately held specialty pharmaceutical company. There is no active secondary market for buying or selling stock in kal\u00e9o. The Company\u2019s fair value estimates can fluctuate materially between reporting periods, primarily due to variances in performance versus expectations, and kal\u00e9o\u2019s ability to meet developmental and commercialization milestones within an anticipated time frame. Commercial sales of kal\u00e9o\u2019s first licensed product, an epinephrine auto-injector, commenced in the first quarter of 2013, and commercial sales of its second product, a naloxone auto-injector, commenced in the third quarter of 2014.\nIn 2009, kal\u00e9o licensed exclusive rights to sanofi-aventis U.S. LLC (\u201cSanofi\u201d) to commercialize the epinephrine auto-injector in the U.S. and Canada. Sanofi announced on October 28, 2015, a voluntary recall of all Auvi-Q and Allerject epinephrine auto-injectors that were on the market. In January 2017, kal\u00e9o announced that it would recommence sales of Auvi-Q in the U.S. in February 2017.\nKal\u00e9o may be unsuccessful in its attempt to re-enter the epinephrine market due to lack of customer acceptance, competition or other market factors beyond its control. If kal\u00e9o is unsuccessful re-entering the epinephrine market, it may require additional funding to support its other products and its development of new products.\nAdditionally, the estimated fair value of the Company\u2019s investment in kal\u00e9o could decline.
