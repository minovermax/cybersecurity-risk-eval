Risk Factors\nThe following discussion identifies the most significant factors that may materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. These and other factors, many of which are beyond the Company\u2019s control, may cause future results of operations to differ materially from past results or those results currently expected or desired. The following information should be read in conjunction with Part II-Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Form 10-K.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS\nChemical manufacturing is inherently hazardous and may result in accidents or may require planned or unplanned production slowdowns or shutdowns, which may disrupt our operations or expose us to significant losses or liabilities, which may have a material impact on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nManufacturing facilities in the Company\u2019s industry are subject to planned and unplanned production slowdowns and shutdowns, turnarounds and outages. Unplanned production disruptions may occur for external reasons, such as natural disasters, weather, disease, strikes, transportation interruption, government regulation, political unrest or terrorism, or internal reasons, such as fire, explosions, mechanical failure, labor-related work stoppages or slowdowns, maintenance, discharges, contamination, environmental remediation or other manufacturing problems. Certain of our production facilities are, and production facilities acquired or built in the future may be, located in areas where unplanned disruptions are more likely. Alternative facilities with sufficient capacity may not be available, may cost substantially more or may take a significant amount of time to increase production or qualify with Company customers, each of which could negatively impact the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Further, some of the Company\u2019s products cannot currently be made, or made in the volume required, at more than one of the Company\u2019s locations. For some of these products, the Company has access to external market suppliers, but the Company cannot guarantee that these products will be available to it in amounts sufficient to meet its requirements or at a cost that is competitive with the Company\u2019s cost of manufacturing these products. Long-term production disruptions may cause Company customers to seek alternative supply, which could further adversely affect Company profitability.\nAlthough the Company takes precautions to enhance the safety of its operations and minimize the risk of disruptions, the hazards associated with chemical manufacturing and the related storage and transportation of raw materials, products and wastes are inherent in our operations. We cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination, discharge or injury resulting from those materials. Also, our suppliers and customers may use and/or generate hazardous materials, and we may be required to indemnify our suppliers, customers or waste disposal contractors against damages and other liabilities arising out of the production, handling or storage of our products or raw materials or the disposal of related wastes. Potential risks include explosions and fires, chemical spills and other discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases, and pipeline and storage tank leaks and ruptures. Those hazards may result in personal injury and loss of life, damage to property, damages to public health and contamination of the environment, which may result in a suspension of operations and the imposition of civil or criminal fines, penalties and other sanctions, cleanup costs, and claims by governmental entities or third-parties. Furthermore, the Company is subject to present and future claims with respect to workplace exposure, exposure of toxic or hazardous substances to contractors on Company premises as well as other persons located nearby, workers' compensation and other matters.\nWe are dependent on the continued operation of our production facilities and the loss or shutdown of operations over an extended period could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, or results of operations. The Company maintains property, business interruption, products liability and casualty insurance policies, which we believe are in accordance with customary industry practices, as well as insurance policies covering other types of risks, including pollution legal liability insurance. However, some of these potential manufacturing hazards and risks may not be insurable. Moreover, even when such hazards and risks are insurable, the insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all losses resulting from the occurrence of any of these events. Each of these insurance policies is subject to customary exclusions, deductibles and coverage limits, in accordance with industry standards and practices. As a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain insurance policies can increase substantially and, in some instances, certain insurance may become unavailable or available only with reduced amounts of coverage. There is also a risk, beyond the reasonable control of the Company, that an insurance carrier may not have the financial resources to cover an insurable loss. As a result, the occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nCustomer product reformulations or new technologies can reduce the demand for the Company\u2019s existing products, and the Company may not be successful in developing or introducing new products.\nThe Company\u2019s products are used in a broad range of customer product applications. Changes in customer manufacturing processes, customer product reformulations, development and use of new technologies or changes in regulatory, legislative or industry requirements may lead to reduced consumption of the Company\u2019s products or cause customers to consider some Company products obsolete or less attractive.\nFor example, increased concerns regarding the safety of 1,4 dioxane in consumer products and its potential impact on human health and the environment may lessen the demand for certain of the Company\u2019s products. The Company generates 1,4 dioxane as a by-product during the manufacture of certain of its surfactant products, including alkoxylates and ether sulfates, used by its customers as cleaning agents in household cleaning, personal care and cosmetics products. In their finished form, consumer products that contain ethoxylated surfactants may contain trace amounts of 1,4 dioxane. 1,4 dioxane has been categorized by regulators as a toxic and carcinogenic substance at certain levels. In December 2019, New York adopted a law that, beginning in 2022 and 2023, will permit no more than trace amounts of the chemical in cleaning, personal care and cosmetics products. California, likewise, is considering regulating 1,4 dioxane in personal care and cleaning products under its Safer Consumer Products regulation. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) also continues to examine 1,4 dioxane as part of its environmental and occupational regulatory authority. We expect our customers to commence reformulating their personal care, cosmetics and cleaning products in 2020 and 2021 to meet New York\u2019s 2022 and 2023 deadlines. These trends and corresponding changes in consumer preferences could reduce demand for our ethoxylated surfactant products, as our customers look to reduce the levels of ethoxylated surfactants in their finished products to stay below the maximum allowed levels or transition to alternative surfactants with lower levels of 1,4 dioxane. We are currently modifying our manufacturing process to reduce 1,4 dioxane content to allow customers to continue to use ethoxylated surfactants at current use levels, while also offering consumer product formulation prototypes that contain low/no dioxane containing surfactants currently offered by the Company.\nIt is imperative that the Company continue to develop new products to replace the sales of products that mature and decline in use, though the Company may not be successful in achieving its growth expectations from developing new products. Moreover, the Company cannot be certain that the costs it incurs investing in new product and technology development will result in an increase in revenues or profits commensurate with its investment, and the introduction of any new products may be disrupted or delayed by manufacturing or other technical difficulties. The Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected if the Company is unable to successfully manage the maturation of existing products and the successful development and introduction of new products.\nThe Company is subject to a variety of environmental, health and safety and product registration laws dealing with the production and sale of chemicals that could require us to incur additional costs or to reformulate or discontinue certain of our products, or expose us to liability or enforcement actions.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are regulated under a number of federal, state, local and foreign environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that govern, among other things, the production and marketing of chemical substances and the discharge, use, handling, transport, storage and disposal of hazardous materials into the air, soil and water. In the United States, these laws and regulations include, but are not limited to the U.S. Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), the Occupational Safety and Health Act and state and local laws, such as California\u2019s Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986 (Proposition 65). Analogous laws outside the United States apply to us in many jurisdictions, including, among others, the European Union\u2019s Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemical Substances (REACH) regulation and its Biocidal Products Regulation. Compliance with these environmental, health and safety laws and regulations is a major consideration for the Company, and to comply with some of these laws, we may need to alter our product lines or implement different or more costly manufacturing processes (including the installation of pollution control equipment), which could lead to a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, the transportation of certain raw materials is highly regulated and is subject to increased regulation or restrictions. These regulations may restrict or prohibit transport of these raw materials, resulting in these raw materials not being available to the Company in quantities desired by the Company or at costs attractive to the Company, which may restrict or substantially limit the Company\u2019s manufacturing operations.\nThe REACH regulation, a registration system that imposes obligations on manufacturers and importers of chemicals and other products into the European Union to compile and file reports and testing data on, and perform safety assessments for, certain chemical substances, was fully implemented in 2018, and any new substances introduced to the EU market in the future must be registered. The costs associated with the Company\u2019s compliance with these registrations have been substantial and are expected to increase as product sales increase because higher tonnage bands have higher annual registration fees and require more testing to support the registration. Moreover, if a registration in the future is not submitted by any applicable deadline, our ability to sell those products may be negatively impacted until the registration process has been completed. In addition, the European Chemical Agency is evaluating existing chemical registrations and may require additional testing and data collection. Chemicals may be assessed and removed from EU commerce entirely, potentially requiring the Company to discontinue certain product lines and to reformulate others, which could materially alter our marketplace position or otherwise have a material financial effect on our costs or revenues. Regulators in other countries are also implementing chemical registration regulations similar to the REACH regulation.\nFurthermore, some of the laws and regulations applicable to us have changed in recent years to impose new obligations or induce increasing compliance costs that could also force us to reformulate or discontinue certain of our products. For example, the European Union is now requiring a review of existing active biocide substances, and based on this review, the European Commission or an individual member state may decide not to authorize the product for continued sale. As another example, TSCA now mandates that the USEPA must designate \u201chigh priority\u201d chemicals and perform a risk evaluation, which could result in a finding of \u201cunreasonable risk\u201d and a decision to promulgate new regulations to address such risk. As a result of such regulations, our ability to sell certain products may be curtailed and customers may avoid purchasing some products in favor of less regulated, less hazardous or less costly alternatives. It may be impractical for us to continue manufacturing heavily regulated products, and we may incur costs to shut down or transition such operations to alternative products. Additionally, the nature, stringency and timing of any future regulations or changes in regulations are uncertain.\nIn addition, increasingly stringent regulation of human exposure to ethylyne oxide by regulatory authorities in the United States could require material expenditures or changes in our manufacturing operations. We use ethylene oxide at our Winder, Georgia and Millsdale, Illinois facilities. We use ethylene oxide in a closed loop process to manufacture surfactants that are used in products such as laundry detergents. The Company does not manufacture ethylene oxide, nor does it use ethylene oxide as a fumigant. Ethylene oxide is listed as a hazardous air pollutant under the Clean Air Act, as amended, emissions of which are regulated by the USEPA and other regulatory authorities. In 2019 Illinois adopted a law limiting ethylene oxide emissions in certain counties. Georgia and Illinois legislators have proposed legislation that would impose additional restrictions on the use of ethylene oxide. The USEPA is considering new standards for ethylene oxide emissions. While our production facilities have not yet been materially affected by changes in ethylene oxide regulation, any additional regulatory restrictions on the use or emission of ethylene oxide by facilities could impair our ability to manufacturer certain products in affected locations, including at our Winder, Georgia and Millsdale, Illinois facilities.\nCompliance with environmental laws could restrict the Company\u2019s ability to expand its facilities or require the Company to modify its facilities and processes or acquire additional costly pollution control equipment, incur other significant expenses, or expose the Company to greater liability associated with its production processes and products. The Company has incurred and will continue to incur capital expenditures and operating costs in complying with these laws and regulations, as our operations currently use, and have historically used, hazardous materials and generate, and have historically generated, quantities of hazardous waste. Some existing environmental laws and regulations impose liability and responsibility on present and former owners, operators or users of facilities and sites for contamination at those locations without regard to causation or knowledge of contamination. Certain of our sites have an extended history of industrial use, which may expose us to liability. We are subject to regulatory oversight and investigation, remediation, and monitoring obligations at certain current and former U.S. Superfund sites, as well as third-party disposal sites, under federal laws and their state and local analogues, including the RCRA, the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, and CERCLA, as well as analogous foreign laws. See Item 3, Legal Proceedings, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 17, Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of current significant environmental proceedings related to certain environmental sites. In the event that new contamination is discovered, including at facilities we may acquire in the future, the Company may become subject to additional obligations. The costs and liabilities associated with these issues may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company is also subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign laws that regulate the manufacture, storage, distribution and labeling of many of the Company\u2019s products, including some of the Company\u2019s disinfecting, sanitizing and antimicrobial products. Some of these laws require the Company to have operating permits for the Company\u2019s production facilities, warehouse facilities and operations. Various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations also require the Company to register the Company\u2019s products and to comply with specified requirements with respect to those products, such as FIFRA, the EU Biocidal Products Regulation and Mexico\u2019s General Law of Ecological Equilibrium and Environmental Protection. Additionally, those requirements, and enforcement of those requirements, may become more stringent in the future. The ultimate cost of compliance with any such requirements could be material.\nAlthough it is our policy to comply with such laws and regulations, it is possible that we have not been or may not be at all times in material compliance with all of those requirements. If the Company has failed to comply or fails to comply in the future with any of these laws and regulations, including permitting and licensing requirements, it may be liable for damages and the costs of remedial actions in excess of the Company\u2019s recorded liabilities, and may also be subject to fines, injunctions or criminal sanctions or to revocation, non-renewal or modification of the Company\u2019s operating permits and revocation of the Company\u2019s product registrations. Any such revocation, modification or non-renewal may require the Company to cease or limit the manufacture and sale of its products at one or more of the Company\u2019s facilities, which may limit or prevent the Company\u2019s ability to meet product demand or build new facilities and may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Any such revocation, non-renewal or modification may also result in an event of default under the indenture for the Company\u2019s notes or under the Company\u2019s credit facilities, which, if not cured or waived, may result in the acceleration of all the Company\u2019s indebtedness.\nIn addition to the costs of complying with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, the Company has incurred and may incur in the future costs defending against environmental litigation and/or investigations brought by government agencies and private parties, including administrative proceedings. The Company is, and may be in the future, a defendant in lawsuits brought by parties alleging environmental damage, personal injury or property damage. A significant judgment or settlement against the Company, to the extent not covered by existing insurance policies, could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Although the Company has insurance policies that may cover some of these potential losses, there is always uncertainty as to whether such insurance may be sufficient to cover such losses or available at all to the Company based on case-specific factors and the specific provisions of the Company\u2019s insurance policies.\nThe potential cost to the Company relating to environmental, health and safety and product registration matters is uncertain due to factors such as the complexity and evolving nature of laws and regulations relating to the environment, health and safety and product registration, including those outside of the United States. Environmental and product registration laws and regulations may also become more stringent over time, imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with any violation, as well as restricting or prohibiting the sale of existing or new products, which may also negatively impact the Company\u2019s operating results. For example, in 2019 the area around Chicago, Illinois was designated as a \u201cserious nonattainment\u201d zone for air emissions, which may limit activities or increase costs at the Company\u2019s Millsdale, Illinois facility. Without limiting the foregoing, these laws or regulations may also restrict or prohibit the use of non-renewable or carbon-based substances, or impose fees or penalties for the use of these substances. Accordingly, the Company may become subject to additional liabilities and increased operating costs in the future under these laws and regulations. The impact of any such changes, which are unknown at this time, may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nTo the extent the Company seeks acquisition opportunities, it may not be able to make acquisitions of suitable candidates or integrate acquisitions successfully.\nIn recent years, the Company has used acquisitions to expand into new markets and to enhance its position in its existing markets. To the extent it seeks to do so in the future it may not be able to successfully identify suitable candidates, negotiate appropriate acquisition terms, obtain financing needed to consummate those acquisitions, complete proposed acquisitions or successfully integrate acquired businesses into its existing operations. In addition, any acquisition, once successfully integrated, may not perform as planned, be accretive to earnings, or otherwise prove beneficial to the Company.\nAcquisitions involve numerous risks, including the assumption of undisclosed or unindemnified liabilities, difficulties in the assimilation of the operations and the transfer of all necessary licenses and permits, technologies, services and products of the acquired companies and the diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns. In addition, prior acquisitions have resulted, and future acquisitions could result, in the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness and other expenses.\nThe Company faces significant global competition in each of its operating segments. If the Company cannot successfully compete in the marketplace, its business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected.\nThe Company faces significant competition from numerous global companies as well as national, regional and local companies in the markets it serves. Many of the Company\u2019s competitors have access to greater financial resources, which may enable them to invest significant capital into their businesses, including expenditures for research and development. Some of the Company\u2019s competitors have their own raw material resources and may be able to produce products more economically. In addition, some of the Company\u2019s customers have internal manufacturing capabilities that allow them to achieve make-versus-buy economics, which may result at times in the Company losing business with these customers in volumes that could adversely affect the Company\u2019s profitability.\nTo achieve expected profitability levels, the Company must, among other things, maintain the service levels, product quality and performance and competitive pricing necessary to retain existing customers and attract new customers as well as continue to develop and introduce new products. The Company\u2019s inability to do so could place it at a competitive disadvantage relative to its competitors, and if the Company cannot successfully compete in the marketplace, its business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected.\nThe volatility of raw material, natural gas and electricity costs, as well as any disruption in their supply may result in increased costs and materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe costs of raw materials, natural gas and electricity represent a substantial portion of the Company\u2019s operating costs. The principal raw materials used in the Company\u2019s products are petroleum-based or plant-based. Natural gas is used in the Company\u2019s manufacturing sites primarily to generate steam for its manufacturing processes. The prices of many of these raw materials can be subject to periods of rapid and significant instability. These fluctuations in prices may be affected by supply and demand factors, such\nas general economic conditions, regulatory developments with respect to and restrictions on the transport of raw materials (some of which may be viewed as hazardous), currency exchange rates, political instability or terrorist attacks, all of which are beyond the Company\u2019s control. The Company may not be able to pass increased raw material or energy costs on to customers through increases in product prices as a result of arrangements the Company has with certain customers and competitive pressures in the market. If the Company is unable to minimize the effects of increased raw material and energy costs or pass such increased costs on to customers, or manage any interruption to the supply of raw materials or energy, its business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected.\nThe Company relies heavily on third-party transportation to deliver raw materials to Company manufacturing facilities and ship products to Company customers. Disruptions in transportation or significant changes in transportation costs could affect the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company relies heavily on railroads, ships, and other over-the-road shipping methods to transport raw materials to its manufacturing facilities and to ship finished products to customers. Transport operations are exposed to various risks, such as extreme weather conditions, natural disasters, technological problems, work stoppages, personnel shortages and operating hazards, as well as interstate and international transportation regulations. If the Company, its suppliers or third-party transportation operators experience transportation problems, or if there are significant changes in the cost of these services, the Company may not be able to arrange efficient alternatives and timely means to obtain raw materials or ship finished product, which could result in a material adverse effect on Company revenues, costs and operating results. For example, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers plans to close certain locks on the Illinois River during the second half of 2020. The Company\u2019s Millsdale, Illinois facility uses the Illinois river for obtaining raw materials and shipping products. This closure could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s costs and operating results.\nDownturns in certain industries, in some cases driven by consumer preferences, and general economic downturns may have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nEconomic downturns may adversely affect users of some end products that are manufactured using the Company\u2019s products and the industries in which such end products are used. For example, the implications of the novel coronavirus outbreak may impact not only markets in Asia, but broader markets as well. During economic downturns, these users may reduce their volume of purchases of such end products or may purchase alternative products, which would reduce demand for the Company\u2019s products. In addition, increasing concern among consumers, public health professionals and government agencies about health and wellness issues could lead some of the Company\u2019s customers to limit the use of certain of our products or result in harm to the Company\u2019s reputation.\nReduced demand from the primary end markets for the Company\u2019s products, such as the consumer products industry, could adversely affect the Company. Additionally, uncertain conditions in the credit markets pose a risk to the overall economy that may impact consumer demand for such end products and customer demand of some of the Company\u2019s products, as well as the Company\u2019s ability to manage normal commercial relationships with its customers, suppliers and creditors. Some of the Company\u2019s customers may not be able to meet the terms of sale and suppliers may not be able to fully perform their contractual obligations due to tighter credit markets or a general slowdown in economic activity.\nIn the event that economic conditions worsen or result in a prolonged downturn or recession, or consumer-driven preferences result in reduced demand for our products, the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s results of operations may be adversely affected by international business risks, including fluctuations in currency exchange rates, legal restrictions and taxes.\nThe Company has substantial operations outside the United States. In the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company\u2019s sales outside of the United States constituted approximately 40 percent of the Company\u2019s net sales. In addition to the risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K that are common to both the Company\u2019s U.S. and non-U.S. operations, the Company faces, and will continue to face, risks related to the Company\u2019s foreign operations such as:\n\u2022\nvariability of intellectual property laws outside the United States, which may impact enforceability and consistency of protection of intellectual property assets;\n\u2022\nhigh levels of inflation;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which may affect product demand and may adversely affect the profitability in U.S. dollars of products and services the Company provides in international markets where payment for the Company\u2019s products and services is made in the local currency;\n\u2022\npolitical, economic, financial and market conditions, which may be unstable;\n\u2022\nchanges in labor conditions and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations;\n\u2022\ncorruption by government officials or other third parties or other adverse government actions;\n\u2022\ndiffering economic cycles and adverse economic conditions;\n\u2022\ntrade and currency restrictions, including tariffs and currency exchange controls imposed by the United States and foreign countries;\n\u2022\nchanges in foreign laws and tax rates or U.S. laws and tax rates with respect to foreign income, which may unexpectedly increase the rate at which the Company\u2019s income is taxed, impose new and additional taxes on remittances, repatriation or other payments by the Company\u2019s subsidiaries, or cause the loss of previously recorded tax benefits;\n\u2022\ngreater difficulty enforcing contracts and collecting accounts receivable;\n\u2022\nenforceability and compliance with U.S. and foreign laws affecting operations outside of the United States, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) (and foreign equivalents), export controls and regulations administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control; and\n\u2022\nevolving laws and regulations over chemicals and chemical production and transportation that could limit the Company\u2019s ability to sell products in certain markets (for example, the EU REACH regulation) and changing laws related to or the modification or non-renewal of operating permits and licenses that could result in material costs relating to regulatory compliance, liabilities, litigation proceedings, or other impacts, such as restrictions or prohibitions on our products.\nThe actual occurrence of any or all of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows in the future.\nVarious liability claims could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial position, operating results and cash flows.\nThe Company may be required to pay for losses or injuries purportedly caused by its products. The Company faces an inherent exposure to various types of claims including general liability, product liability, product recall, toxic tort and environmental, among others, if its products, or the end products that are manufactured with the Company\u2019s products, result in property damage, injury or death. In addition, because the Company conducts business in multiple jurisdictions, the Company also faces an inherent exposure to other general claims based on its operations in those jurisdictions and the laws of those jurisdictions, including but not limited to claims arising from its relationship with employees, distributors, agents and customers, and other parties with whom it has a business relationship, directly or indirectly. Many of these claims may be made against the Company even if there is no evidence of a loss from that claim, and these claims may be made by individual persons, groups of persons, or groups of plaintiffs in a class action. Defending these claims could result in significant legal expenses relating to defense costs and/or damage awards and diversion of management\u2019s time and the Company\u2019s resources. Any claim brought against the Company could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf the Company is unable to protect its intellectual property rights, the Company\u2019s ability to compete may be negatively impacted.\nThe Company\u2019s patents and other intellectual property may not prevent competitors from independently developing or selling similar or duplicative products and services, and there can be no assurance that the resources the Company invests to protect its intellectual property will be sufficient or that the Company\u2019s intellectual property portfolio will adequately deter misappropriation or improper use of its technology. The Company could also face competition in some countries where it has not invested in an intellectual property portfolio, or where intellectual property rights are more difficult to obtain and/or assert. In addition, the Company may be the target of aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by third parties, including non-practicing entities. Regardless of the merit of such claims, responding to infringement claims can be expensive and time-consuming. If the Company is found to infringe any third-party rights, it could be required to pay substantial damages or it could be enjoined from offering some of its products and services. Also, there can be no assurances that the Company will be able to obtain or renew from third parties the licenses it may need in the future on reasonable terms or at all.\nThe international scope of the Company\u2019s operations and corporate structure may expose the Company to potentially adverse tax consequences.\nThe Company is subject to taxation in and to the tax laws and regulations of multiple jurisdictions as a result of the international scope of its operations and corporate structure. The Company is also subject to intercompany pricing laws, including those relating to the flow of funds between its entities pursuant to, for example, purchase agreements, licensing agreements or other arrangements. Adverse developments in these laws or regulations, or any change in position regarding the application, administration or\ninterpretation of these laws or regulations in any applicable jurisdiction could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, the tax authorities in any applicable jurisdiction may disagree with the positions the Company has taken or intends to take regarding the tax treatment or characterization of any of the Company\u2019s transactions, including the tax treatment or characterization of the Company\u2019s indebtedness. If any applicable tax authorities were to successfully challenge the tax treatment or characterization of any of the Company\u2019s transactions, it could result in the disallowance of deductions, the imposition of withholding taxes on internal deemed transfers or other consequences that could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company\u2019s failure to comply with the anti-corruption laws of the United States and various international jurisdictions could negatively impact its reputation and results of operations.\nDoing business on a worldwide basis requires the Company to comply with anti-corruption laws and regulations imposed by governments around the world with jurisdiction over our operations, which may include the FCPA and the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 (the Bribery Act), as well as the laws of the countries where the Company does business. These laws and regulations can apply to companies and individual directors, officers, employees and agents, and may restrict the Company\u2019s operations, trade practices, investment decisions and partnering activities. Where they apply, the FCPA and the Bribery Act prohibit, among other things, the Company and its officers, directors, employees and business partners, including joint venture partners and agents acting on the Company\u2019s behalf, from corruptly offering, promising, authorizing or providing anything of value to \u201cforeign officials\u201d for the purposes of influencing official decisions or obtaining or retaining business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment. The Bribery Act also prohibits non-governmental \u201ccommercial\u201d bribery and accepting bribes. Part of the Company\u2019s business may involve dealings with governments and state-owned business enterprises, the employees and representatives of which may be considered \u201cforeign officials\u201d for purposes of the FCPA and the Bribery Act. The Company is also subject to the jurisdiction of various governments and regulatory agencies around the world, which may bring Company personnel and agents into contact with \u201cforeign officials\u201d responsible for issuing or renewing permits, licenses, or approvals or for enforcing other governmental regulations. The Company\u2019s global operations, including in countries with high levels of perceived corruption, expose it to the risk of violating, or being accused of violating, anti-corruption laws. Any failure on the part of the Company to successfully comply with these laws and regulations may expose the Company to reputational harm as well as significant sanctions, including criminal fines, imprisonment of its employees or representatives, civil penalties, disgorgement of profits, injunctions and debarment from government contracts, as well as other remedial measures. Investigations of alleged violations can be expensive and disruptive. Compliance with these laws can increase the cost of doing business globally. The Company maintains policies and procedures designed to assist the Company and its subsidiaries in complying with applicable anti-corruption laws. However, there can be no guarantee that these policies and procedures will effectively prevent violations by Company employees or representatives for which the Company may be held responsible, and any such violation could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation, business, financial position and results of operations.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could affect Company financial results.\nThe Company is also exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The Company\u2019s results of operations are reported in U.S. dollars. However, outside the United Sates, the Company\u2019s sales and costs are denominated in a variety of currencies including the European euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, Mexican peso, Colombian peso, Philippine peso, Brazilian real, Polish zloty, and Chinese RMB. The Company translates its local currency financial results into U.S. dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during the reporting period or the exchange rate at the end of that period. During times of a strengthening U.S. dollar, the Company\u2019s reported international sales and earnings may be reduced because the local currency may translate into fewer U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in exchange rates may materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn all jurisdictions in which the Company operates, the Company is also subject to laws and regulations that govern foreign investment, foreign trade and currency exchange transactions. These laws and regulations may limit the Company\u2019s ability to repatriate cash as dividends or otherwise to the United States or to efficiently allocate cash to support strategic initiatives, and may limit the Company\u2019s ability to convert foreign currency cash flows into U.S. dollars. A weakening of the currencies in which the Company generates sales relative to the foreign currencies in which the Company\u2019s costs are denominated may lower the Company\u2019s operating profits and cash flows.\nThe Company could be adversely affected by downgrades to its credit ratings or disruptions in its ability to access well-functioning capital markets.\nHistorically, the Company has relied on the debt capital markets to fund portions of its capital investments and access to bank credit facilities as part of its working capital management strategy. The Company\u2019s continued access to these markets, and the terms of such access, depend on multiple factors including the condition of debt capital markets, the Company\u2019s operating performance, and\nits credit ratings. These ratings are based on a number of factors, which include rating agencies\u2019 assessment of the Company\u2019s financial strength and financial policies. There can be no assurance that any particular rating assigned to the Company will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency, if in that rating agency\u2019s judgment, future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating so warrant. Incurrence of additional debt by the Company could adversely affect its credit ratings. The Company depends on banks and other financial institutions to provide credit to its business and perform under the Company\u2019s agreements with them. Defaults by one or more of these counterparties on their obligations to the Company could materially and adversely affect it. Any downgrade of the Company\u2019s credit ratings could materially adversely affect its cost of funds, liquidity, competitive position and access to capital markets and increase the cost of and counterparty risks associated with existing facilities, which could materially and adversely affect Company business operations, financial condition, and results of operations.\nConflicts, military actions, terrorist attacks and general instability, particularly in certain energy-producing nations, along with increased security regulations related to our industry, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nConflicts, military actions and terrorist attacks have precipitated economic instability and turmoil in financial markets. Instability and turmoil, particularly in energy-producing nations, may result in raw material cost increases. The uncertainty and economic disruption resulting from hostilities, military action or acts of terrorism may impact any or all of the Company\u2019s facilities and operations or those of its suppliers or customers. Accordingly, any conflict, military action or terrorist attack that impacts the Company or any of its suppliers or customers, or any resulting economic instability resulting from such conflict, military action or terrorist attack, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nCost overruns, delays and miscalculations in capacity needs with respect to the Company\u2019s expansion or other capital projects could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nFrom time to time, the Company initiates expansion and other significant capital projects. Projects of this type are subject to risks of delay or cost overruns inherent in any large construction project resulting from numerous factors, including the following: shortages of equipment, materials or skilled labor; work stoppages; unscheduled delays in the delivery of ordered materials and equipment; unanticipated cost increases; difficulties in obtaining necessary permits or in meeting permit conditions; difficulties in meeting regulatory requirements or obtaining regulatory approvals; availability of suppliers to certify equipment for existing and enhanced regulations; design and engineering problems; and failure or delay of third-party service providers, civil unrest and labor disputes. Significant cost overruns or delays in completing a capital project could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s return on investment, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, if the Company misjudges its future capacity needs, this too could negatively impact its operations, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company relies extensively on information technology (IT) systems to conduct its business. Interruption of, damage to or compromise of the Company\u2019s IT systems and failure to maintain the integrity of customer, colleague or Company data could harm the Company\u2019s reputation and have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company relies on IT systems in its operations, including production, supply chain, research and development, finance, human resource and regulatory functions. The Company\u2019s ability to effectively manage its business depends on the security, reliability and adequacy of these systems. IT system failures due to events including but not limited to network disruptions, programming errors, computer viruses and security breaches (e.g., cyber-attacks) could impact production activities, impede shipment of products, cause delays or cancellations of customer orders, or hamper the processing of transactions or reporting of financial results. These or similar occurrences, whether accidental or intentional, could result in theft, unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property or confidential business information of our employees, customers, suppliers or other third parties, which could harm our reputation and competitive position, reduce the value of our investments in research and development and other strategic initiatives, result in a loss of business, as well as remedial and other costs, fines, investigations, enforcement actions or lawsuits or otherwise materially and adversely affect our business.\nThe Company continues to develop and enhance controls and security measures designed to protect against the risk of theft, loss or fraudulent or unlawful use of customer, supplier, third party, employee or Company data, and it maintains an ongoing process to re-evaluate the adequacy of its controls and measures. The Company may also be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance its information privacy and security measures and/or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. The Company maintains what it believes to be adequate and collectible insurance in the event of the theft, loss, fraudulent or unlawful use of customer, supplier, third party, employee or Company data, but any such occurrences could result in costs that may not be covered or may be in excess of any available insurance that the Company may have procured. While the Company has a comprehensive program in place for continuously reviewing, maintaining, testing and upgrading its IT systems and security, there can\nbe no assurance that such efforts will prevent breakdowns of or breaches in Company IT systems that could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends on its executive management and other key personnel.\nThe Company\u2019s future success depends to a significant degree on the skills, experience and efforts of its executive management and other key personnel and their ability to provide the Company with uninterrupted leadership and direction. The availability of highly qualified talent is limited and the competition for talent is robust; as a result, the Company may not be able to recruit and retain the personnel it needs if it were to lose an existing member of executive management or other key personnel. The Company\u2019s future success will depend on its ability to have adequate succession plans in place and to attract, retain and develop qualified personnel. A failure to efficiently replace members of executive management and other key personnel and to attract, retain and develop new qualified personnel could have a material and adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company has a significant amount of indebtedness and may incur additional indebtedness, or need to refinance existing indebtedness, in the future, which may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company has a significant amount of indebtedness and may incur additional indebtedness in the future. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had $222.1 million of debt on its balance sheet. U.S. debt consisted of $222.1 million in unsecured promissory notes with maturities extending from 2020 until 2027. In addition, on December 31, 2019 the Company was party to a $350.0 million credit facility.\nCertain of the Company\u2019s foreign subsidiaries periodically maintain bank term loans and short-term bank lines of credit in their respective countries to meet working capital requirements as well as to fund capital expenditure programs and acquisitions. As of December 31, 2019, the Company\u2019s foreign subsidiaries did not have any outstanding debt.\nThe Company\u2019s current indebtedness and any additional indebtedness incurred in the future may materially and adversely affect its business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. For example, such indebtedness could:\n\u2022\nrequire the Company to dedicate a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to pay principal and interest on the Company\u2019s debt, which would reduce funds available to fund future working capital, capital expenditures and other general operating requirements;\n\u2022\nlimit the Company\u2019s ability to borrow funds that may be needed to operate and expand its business;\n\u2022\nlimit the Company\u2019s flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in the Company\u2019s business and the industries in which the Company operates;\n\u2022\nincrease the Company\u2019s vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions or a downturn in the Company\u2019s business; and\n\u2022\nplace the Company at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that have less debt.\nThe Company\u2019s loan agreements contain customary provisions that, among other things, require maintenance of certain financial ratios and place limitations on additional debt, investments and payment of dividends. The Company\u2019s ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control. Failure to comply with these loan agreement provisions would require debt restructuring that could be materially adverse to the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nAn increase in interest rates could limit the Company\u2019s ability to incur additional debt to fund the Company\u2019s strategic plans or to refinance maturing debt without incurring significant additional cost, and could make borrowings under the Company\u2019s credit facility or other floating rate debt materially more expensive. Additionally, any future disruptions in the credit and financial markets may reduce the availability of debt financing or refinancing and increase the costs associated with such financing. If the Company is unable to secure financing on satisfactory terms, or at all, its business financial position, results of operations and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 36898, "SIC": 2840, "TIC": "SCL"}
