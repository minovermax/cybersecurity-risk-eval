RISK FACTORS\nRISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information described elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K, you should carefully consider the following risk factors, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The risks described below are not the only risks facing our Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AND OUR INDUSTRY\nIf we do not continue to innovate and provide products and services that are useful to insurance companies in a cost-effective way, we may not remain competitive, and our revenues and operating results could suffer.\nOur future success depends on our ability to provide innovative and quality products and services for the insurance marketplace. Because our products and services represent the core functionality that powers the businesses of our customers, our competitors are constantly developing innovations in similar products and services. As a result, we must continue to invest significant resources in research and development in order to enhance our existing products and services and introduce new products and services that insurance companies can easily and effectively use. If we are unsuccessful in these endeavors, we may not remain competitive, and our revenues and operating results could suffer. Additionally, we rely on our references from existing customers for new sales. If we are unable to provide quality products and services, then our customers may become dissatisfied and may not provide these references. We also rely on an offshore software development vendor for developing and servicing our products, and our operating results would suffer if we cannot maintain our current cost structure through offshore development resources in the future.\nWe depend on product introductions in order to remain competitive in our industry.\nWe are currently investing resources in product development and expect to continue to do so in the future. Our future success will depend on our ability to continue to enhance our current product line and to continue to develop and introduce new products that keep pace with competitive product introductions and technological developments, satisfy diverse and evolving insurance industry requirements and otherwise achieve market acceptance. We may not be successful in continuing to introduce and market, on a timely and cost-effective basis, product enhancements or new products that respond to technological advances by others. Any failure by us to anticipate or respond adequately to changes in technology and insurance industry preferences, or any significant delays in product development or introduction, would significantly and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur products may not achieve market acceptance, which may make it difficult for us to compete.\nOur future success will depend upon our ability to increase the number of insurance companies that license our software products. As a result of the intense competition in our industry and the rapid technological changes which characterize it, our products may not achieve significant market acceptance. Further, insurance companies are typically characterized by slow decision-making and numerous bureaucratic and institutional obstacles which will make our efforts to significantly expand our customer base difficult.\nWe depend on key personnel.\nOur success depends to a significant extent upon a limited number of members of senior management and other key employees, including Manish D. Shah, our President and Chief Executive Officer. We maintain \u201ckey-man\u201d life insurance on Mr. Shah in the amount of $1,000,000 per individual. The loss of the service of one or more key managers or other key employees could have a significant and adverse effect upon our business, operating results or financial condition. In addition, we believe that our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain additional highly skilled technical, management, sales and marketing personnel. Competition for such personnel in the computer software industry is intense. We may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.\nWe may be subject to information technology system failures and network disruptions.\nInformation technology system failures, network disruptions and breaches of data security caused by such factors, including, but not limited to, earthquakes, hurricanes, fire, flood, theft, fraud, malicious attack, acts of terrorism or other causes could disrupt our operations. While we have taken steps to address these concerns by implementing internal control measures, there can be no assurance that such a system failure, disruption or breach will not materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results, including loss of revenue due to adverse customer reaction or required corrective action. In addition, our property and business interruption insurance coverage may not be adequate to fully compensate us for losses that may occur.\nOur market is highly competitive.\nBoth the computer software and the insurance software systems industries are highly competitive. There are a number of larger companies, including computer manufacturers, computer service and software companies and insurance companies, that have greater financial resources than we have. These companies currently offer and have the technological ability to develop software products that are core to the business of insurance companies and similar to those offered by us. These companies present a significant competitive challenge to our business. Because we do not have the same financial resources as these competitors, we may have a difficult time in the future in competing with these companies. In addition, very large insurers internally develop systems similar to our systems and as a result, they may not become customers of our software. We compete on the basis of our insurance knowledge, products, service, price, system functionality and performance and technological advances. Although we believe we can continue to compete on the basis of these factors, some of our current competitors have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, greater brand recognition and significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do. Our current competitors may be able to:\n\u00b7 undertake more extensive marketing campaigns for their brands and services;\n\u00b7 devote more resources to product development;\n\u00b7 adopt more aggressive pricing policies; and\n\u00b7 make more attractive offers to potential employees and third-party service providers.\nIf we are unable to attract new customers and increase business with existing customers, our growth and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nOur success depends on our ability to attract new customers and develop new revenue streams. We generate revenue from software contract licenses, professional services fees from ongoing software customization and continuing support fees for technical and regulatory software updates on a monthly basis. To sustain or increase our revenue, we must add new customers and encourage existing to purchase additional licenses from us, including our integrated solutions. In addition to license revenue, we receive significant revenues from support services and professional services. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain or increase our revenues from these services. We have experienced a decline in license revenue since the first quarter of 2014, which could continue in future periods. Our ability to slow or reverse this declining rate of growth will depend in part upon our ability to successfully attract new customers and increase revenue from existing clients (including our ability to cross-sell our full suite of offerings). However, we operate in a highly competitive market, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so.\nIf the Merger is not completed, our debt service obligations under our Credit Agreement with Imperium could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur Credit Agreement with Imperium provides for a three-year term loan facility to the Cover-All Subsidiary of $2 million and a three-year revolving credit line to the Cover-All Subsidiary of up to $250,000. As of December 31, 2014, we had $2 million outstanding under the term loan and no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit line. Our Credit Agreement imposes on us certain restrictions and contains financial covenants. Our debt service obligations and the amortization of deferred financing costs associated with entering into the Credit Agreement could have important consequences to us and our financial condition and results of operations. If we do not generate sufficient cash from our operations to service our debt obligations under the Credit Agreement, we may need to take one or more actions, including refinancing our debt, obtaining additional financing, selling assets, obtaining additional equity capital, restructuring our operations or reducing or delaying capital or other expenditures. We cannot be certain that our cash flow will be sufficient to allow us to pay the principal and interest on our debt obligations under the Credit Agreement and meet our other obligations.\nUnder the Credit Agreement, the Cover-All Subsidiary granted a security interest in substantially all of its assets to Imperium. In addition, we guaranteed the Cover-All Subsidiary\u2019s performance under the Credit Agreement and pledged all of the outstanding shares of the Cover-All Subsidiary in support of such guarantee. The Credit Agreement contains covenants that, among other things, require us to maintain minimum revenues and EBITDA (determined on a consolidated basis), tested annually, commencing with the twelve months ending September 30, 2013. As of September 30, 2014, we were in compliance with our minimum revenue and EBITDA covenants under the Credit Agreement. If we or the Cover-All Subsidiary default on the covenants or other obligations under the Credit Agreement and are unable to cure any such default, Imperium could elect to declare all borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement, together with accumulated and unpaid interest and other fees, immediately due and payable. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, all amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement will be repaid in full and the indebtedness thereunder discharged.\nWe depend upon proprietary technology and we are subject to the risk of third party claims of infringement.\nOur success and ability to compete depends in part upon our proprietary software technology. We also rely on certain software that we license from others. We rely on a combination of trade secret, copyright and trademark laws, nondisclosure and other contractual agreements and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights. We currently have no patents or patent applications pending. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. The steps we take to protect our proprietary technology may not prevent misappropriation of our technology, and this protection may not stop competitors from developing products which function or have features similar to our products.\nWhile we believe that our products and trademarks do not infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties, third parties may claim that our products infringe, or may infringe, upon their proprietary rights. Any infringement claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel, cause product shipment delays or require us to develop non-infringing technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements. Royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. If a claim of product infringement against us is successful and we fail or are unable to develop non-infringing technology or license the infringed or similar technology, our business, operating results and financial condition could be significantly and adversely affected.\nWe depend on existing major customers, the loss of one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe anticipate that our operations will continue to depend upon the continuing business of our existing customers, and the ability to attract new customers. In 2014, our software products operations depended primarily on certain existing major customers. Two customers generated approximately 24% and 18%, respectively, of our revenues in 2014, and 24% and 11%, respectively, of our revenues in 2013. The loss of such customers or one or more of our other existing major customers or our inability to continue to attract new customers could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition significantly.\nA decline in computer software spending may result in a decrease in our revenues or lower our growth rate.\nA decline in the demand for computer software among our current and prospective customers may result in decreased revenues or a lower growth rate for us because our sales depend, in part, on our customers\u2019 level of funding for new or additional computer software systems and services. Moreover, demand for our solutions may be reduced by a decline in overall demand for computer software and services. The current decline in overall technology spending may cause our customers to reduce or eliminate software and services spending and cause price erosion for our solutions, which would substantially affect our sales of new software licenses and the average sales price for these licenses. Because of these market and economic conditions, we believe there will continue to be uncertainty in the level of demand for our products and services. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will be able to increase or maintain our revenues.\nWe may not get the full benefit of our tax loss carry forwards.\nUnder the Code, companies that have not been operating profitably are allowed to apply certain of their past losses to offset future taxable income liabilities they may incur once they reach profitability. These amounts are known as net operating tax loss carryforwards, or NOLs. As of December 31, 2014, we had a total of approximately $9.9 million of federal NOLs expiring at various dates through 2032. Because of certain provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 related to\nchange of control, however, we may not get the full benefit of these NOLs. If we are limited from using NOLs to offset any of our income, this would increase our taxes owed and reduce our cash for operations. If the Merger is completed, the vast majority of the tax benefits from the use of these NOLs are not expected to be transferrable to the combined company following completion of the Merger.\nIf we are unable to maintain the listing standards of the NYSE MKT, our common stock may be delisted, which may have a material adverse effect on the liquidity and value of our common stock.\nOur common stock is traded on the NYSE MKT. To maintain our listing on the NYSE MKT, we must meet certain financial and liquidity criteria. The market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be subject to significant fluctuation as a result of periodic variations in our revenues and results of operations. If we fail to meet any of the NYSE MKT\u2019s listing standards, we may be delisted. In the event of delisting, trading of our common stock would most likely be conducted in the over the counter market on an electronic bulletin board established for unlisted securities, which could have a material adverse effect on the market liquidity and value of our common stock.\nHolders of our common stock may have difficulty in selling those shares.\nWhile our common shares trade on the NYSE MKT, our stock is thinly traded and investors may have difficulty in selling their shares. The low trading volume of our common stock is outside of our control, and may not increase in the near future or, even if it does increase in the future, may not be maintained. In addition, because our common stock trades at a price less than $5.00 per share, brokers effecting transactions in our common stock may be subject to additional customer disclosure and record keeping obligations, including disclosure of the risks associated with low price stocks, stock quote information and broker compensation. Brokers effecting transactions in our common stock may also be subject to additional sales practice requirements under certain Exchange Act rules, including making inquiries into the suitability of investments for each customer or obtaining a prior written agreement for the specific stock purchase. Because of these additional obligations, some brokers will not effect transactions in our common stock.\nOur stock price has been volatile.\nQuarterly operating results have fluctuated and are likely to continue to fluctuate. The market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile. Factors that are difficult to predict, such as quarterly revenues and operating results, limited trading volumes and overall market performance, may have a significant effect on the price of our common stock. Revenues and operating results have varied considerably in the past from period to period and are likely to vary considerably in the future. We plan product development and other expenses based on anticipated future revenue. If revenue falls below expectations, financial performance is likely to be adversely affected because only small portions of expenses vary with revenue. As a result, quarterly period-to-period comparisons of operating results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon to predict future performance.\nWe may not pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the future.\nDeclaration and payment of any dividend on our common stock is subject to the discretion of our board of directors. The timing and amount of dividend payments will be dependent upon factors such as our earnings, financial condition, cash requirements and availability, and restrictions in our credit facilities. While we paid a special cash dividend in April 2009, we have not paid any dividends since 2009 and the payment of future dividends is not guaranteed or assured. Accordingly, it is likely that investors may have to rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation, as amended, and by-laws and Delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of or changes in our management and, as a result, depress the trading price of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation, as amended (the \u201cCertificate of Incorporation\u201d), and bylaws contain provisions that could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control or changes in our management that our stockholders may deem advantageous. These provisions:\n\u00b7 require super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our Certificate of Incorporation and bylaws;\n\u00b7 establish a staggered board of directors;\n\u00b7 limit the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u00b7 prohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n\u00b7 provide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws; and\n\u00b7 establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nIn addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which, subject to some exceptions, prohibits \u201cbusiness combinations\u201d between a Delaware corporation and an \u201cinterested stockholder,\u201d which is generally defined as a stockholder who becomes a beneficial owner of 15% or more of a Delaware corporation\u2019s voting stock for a three-year period following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder. Section 203 could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control that our stockholders might consider to be in their best interests.\nThese anti-takeover defenses could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and cause us to take corporate actions other than those you desire.\nIf research analysts do not continue to publish research about our business or if they issue unfavorable commentary or downgrade our common stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that research analysts publish about us and our business. If we do not establish and maintain adequate research coverage or if one or more analysts who covers us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price of our common stock could decline. If one or more of the research analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our common stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nRISKS RELATED TO THE MERGER AND THE COMBINED COMPANY\nCurrently, there is no public market for Majesco\u2019s common stock. Cover-All stockholders cannot be sure that an active trading market will develop for or of the market price of the shares of Majesco common stock they will receive or that the combined company will successfully obtain authorization for listing on the NYSE MKT or a national securities exchange.\nUnder the Merger Agreement, each share of Cover-All common stock will be converted into the right to receive shares of Majesco common stock in an amount equal to such number of shares of Cover-All common stock multiplied by the Exchange Ratio. Majesco is an indirectly wholly owned subsidiary of Mastek and prior to this transaction it has not issued any securities in the U.S. markets or elsewhere nor has there been extensive information about it, its businesses or operations publicly available. Majesco has agreed to use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the shares of Majesco common stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on the NYSE MKT prior to the effective time of the Merger and the approval of the listing on the NYSE MKT of the Majesco common stock to be issued in the Merger is a condition to the closing of the Merger. However, the listing of shares on the NYSE MKT does not assure that a market for the Majesco common stock will develop or the price at which the shares will trade. No assurance can be provided as to the demand for or trading price of Majesco common stock following the closing of the Merger and the Majesco shares may trade at a price less than the current market price of Cover-All common stock.\nEven if the combined company is successful in developing a public market, there may not be enough liquidity in such market to enable shareholders to sell their shares of common stock. If a public market for the combined company\u2019s common stock does not develop, investors may not be able to re-sell the shares of their common stock, rendering their shares illiquid and possibly resulting in a complete loss of their investment. Majesco cannot predict the extent to which investor interest in the combined company will lead to the development of an active, liquid trading market. The trading price of and demand for Majesco common stock following completion of the Merger and the development and continued existence of a market and favorable price for the Majesco common stock will depend on a number of conditions, including the development of a market following, including by analysts and other investment professionals, the businesses, operations, results and prospects of Majesco, general market and economic conditions, governmental actions, regulatory\nconsiderations, legal proceedings and developments or other factors. These and other factors may impair the development of a liquid market and the ability of investors to sell shares at an attractive price. These factors also could cause the market price and demand for Majesco common stock to fluctuate substantially, which may limit or prevent investors from readily selling their shares and may otherwise affect negatively the price and liquidity of Majesco common stock. Many of these factors and conditions are beyond the control of Majesco or Majesco shareholders. Upon completion of the Merger, Mastek will own approximately 83.5% of Majesco\u2019s common stock on a fully diluted basis. Sales by Mastek or the perception that sales may be made by it could significantly reduce the market price of the Majesco common stock.\nBecause the Exchange Ratio is not generally adjustable and the market price of Cover-All common stock will fluctuate, Cover-All shareholders cannot be certain of the precise value of the consideration they will receive at the closing of the Merger.\nThe Merger Agreement has set the Exchange Ratio for each share of Cover-All common stock as described in \u201cThe Merger - Merger Consideration and Adjustment.\u201d The Exchange Ratio will not change to reflect changes in the value or market price of Majesco or Cover-All common stock. The market price of Cover-All common stock at the time of completion of the Merger may vary significantly from the market prices of Cover-All common stock on the date the Merger Agreement was executed and the date of this in this annual report on Form 10-K. Stock price changes may result from, among other things, changes in the business, operations or prospects of Majesco or Cover-All prior to or following the Merger, litigation or regulatory considerations, general business, market, industry or economic conditions and other factors both within and beyond the control of Cover-All and Majesco.\nTherefore, if before the completion of the Merger the market price of Cover-All common stock declines from the market price on the date of the Merger Agreement, then the Cover-All stockholders could receive consideration in the Merger with substantially lower value. Neither Cover-All nor Majesco is permitted to terminate the Merger Agreement solely because of changes in the market price of their common stock. Accordingly, at the time of the Cover-All special meeting, you will not know or be able to calculate the market value of the Merger consideration you will receive upon completion of the Merger.\nFailure to complete the Merger could harm Cover-All\u2019s future business and operations.\nIf the Merger is not completed, Cover-All is subject to the following risks, among others:\n\u00b7 costs related to the Merger, such as legal and accounting fees, must be paid even if the Merger is not completed;\n\u00b7 if the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, Cover-All may be required to pay Majesco a termination fee of $2.5 million;\n\u00b7 the attention of management of Cover-All may have been diverted to the Merger rather than to the company\u2019s operations and the pursuit of other opportunities that could have been beneficial to it;\n\u00b7 the potential loss of key personnel during the pendency of the Merger as employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company;\n\u00b7 the price of Cover-All stock may decline and remain volatile;\n\u00b7 Cover-All will have been subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of its business which may have prevented it from making certain acquisitions or dispositions or pursuing certain business opportunities while the Merger was pending; and\n\u00b7 Cover-All may be subject to litigation related to the Merger or any failure to complete the Merger.\nIn addition, if the Merger Agreement is terminated and the board of directors of Majesco determines to seek another business combination, there can be no assurance that Cover-All will be able to find a partner willing to provide equivalent or more attractive consideration than the consideration to be provided by Majesco in the Merger. Furthermore, Cover-All may still be required to pay Majesco a $2.5 million termination fee if it consummates another business combination within six months of the termination of the Merger under certain circumstances.\nThe Merger may be completed even though material adverse changes may result from the announcement of the Merger, industry-wide changes and other causes.\nIn general, either Cover-All or Majesco can refuse to complete the Merger if there is a material adverse change affecting the other party between the signing date of the Merger Agreement, and the planned closing. However, certain types of changes do not permit either party to refuse to complete the Merger, even if such change could be said to have a material adverse effect on Cover-All or Majesco, including the following events (except, in some cases, where the change has a disproportionate effect on a party):\n\u00b7 changes generally affecting the economy, financial or securities markets;\n\u00b7 the announcement of the Merger and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the impact thereof on the relationships of a party with its employees, customers, suppliers or partners;\n\u00b7 the outbreak or escalation of war or any act of terrorism, civil unrest or natural disasters;\n\u00b7 changes (including changes in law) or general conditions in the industry in which the party operates;\n\u00b7 changes in GAAP (or the authoritative interpretation of GAAP); or\n\u00b7 compliance with the terms of, or the taking of any action required by the Merger Agreement.\nIf adverse changes occur and Cover-All and Majesco still complete the Merger, the combined company\u2019s stock price may suffer. This in turn may reduce the value of the Merger to the stockholders of Cover-All.\nThe pendency of the Merger could materially adversely affect the business and operations of Cover-All or result in a loss of its employees, which, consequently, could materially adversely affect the business and operations of the combined company.\nUncertainty about the effect of the Merger on employees, customers and suppliers may have an adverse effect on Cover-All and its business and, consequently, on the combined company. These uncertainties may impair Cover-All\u2019s ability to attract, retain and motivate employees until the completion of the Merger, which may have a material adverse effect on Cover-All if the Merger is not completed. If employees depart because of issues concerning employment security and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with the combined company, Majesco\u2019s business could be adversely affected. Similarly, uncertainties about the effect of the Merger could cause customers, suppliers and others who deal with Cover-All to change their existing business relationships, which could negatively affect revenues, earnings and cash flows of Cover-All, as well as the market price of Cover-All common stock, regardless of whether the Merger is completed. The realization of any of these risks may materially adversely affect the business and financial results of the combined company.\nCurrent shareholders will have a reduced ownership and voting interest in the combined company after the Merger.\nAs a result of the Merger, current Majesco shareholders and Cover-All stockholders are expected to hold approximately 83.5% and 16.5% on a fully diluted basis, respectively, of the combined company\u2019s outstanding common stock immediately following completion of the Merger, calculated on a fully diluted basis. Majesco shareholders and Cover-All stockholders currently have the right to vote for their respective directors and on other matters affecting the applicable company. When the Merger occurs, each Cover-All stockholder that receives shares of the combined company\u2019s common stock will hold a percentage ownership of the combined company that will be significantly smaller than the stockholder\u2019s current percentage ownership of Cover-All. The combined company will be controlled by Mastek and its affiliates, which will own approximately 83.5% of all shares of the combined company on a fully diluted basis. As further discussed below, Mastek and its affiliates, including Mastek UK, will be able to exercise significant influence over the combined company\u2019s business policies and affairs due to its large ownership percentage. As a result of their reduced ownership percentages, former Cover-All stockholders will have less voting power in the combined company than they now have with respect to Cover-All.\nMastek and its affiliates will exercise significant influence over the combined company, and their interests in the combined company may be different than yours.\nFollowing the completion of the Merger, Mastek and its affiliates, including Mastek UK, will beneficially own approximately 83.5% of the outstanding common stock of the combined company calculated on a fully diluted basis.\nAccordingly, Mastek and its affiliates will be able to exercise significant influence over the combined company\u2019s business policies and affairs, including the composition of the combined company\u2019s board of directors and any action requiring the approval of the combined company\u2019s stockholders, including the adoption of amendments to the articles of incorporation and the approval of a merger or sale of substantially all of the combined company\u2019s assets. The interests of Mastek and its affiliates may conflict with your interests. For example, these shareholders may support certain long-term strategies or objectives for the combined company which may not be accretive to shareholders in the short term. The concentration of ownership may also delay, defer or even prevent a change in control of the combined company, even if such a change in control would benefit our other stockholders, and may make some transactions more difficult or impossible without the support of these parties. This significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price for the combined company\u2019s common stock because investors often perceive disadvantages in owning stock in companies with shareholders who own significant percentages of a company\u2019s outstanding stock.\nSome of the Majesco and Cover-All officers and directors have interests in the Merger that are different from yours and that may influence them to support or approve the Merger without regard to your interests.\nCertain officers of Majesco and Cover-All participate in arrangements that provide them with interests in the Merger that are different from yours, including, among others, continued service as an executive officer or director of the combined company and the right to continued indemnification for directors, executive officers and former directors and executive officers of Cover-All following the completion of the Merger.\nThe combined company will be a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the NYSE MKT rules and, as a result, will qualify for, and intends to rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements.\nIn addition to the consequences of the concentration of share ownership and possible conflicts between the interests of Mastek and its affiliates, including Mastek UK, and your interests discussed above, the combined company will be a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the rules of the NYSE MKT. Under these rules, a company in which over 50% of the voting power is held by an individual, a group or another company is a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d and is not obligated to comply with certain corporate governance requirements, including requirements that:\n\u00b7 a majority of its board of directors consist of independent directors;\n\u00b7 the combined company have a nominating committee or a compensation committee;\n\u00b7 the combined company have a nominating committee that is composed entirely of independent directors;\n\u00b7 the combined company have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors; and\n\u00b7 the compensation of the chief executive officer be determined, or recommended to the board of directors for determination, either by a compensation committee comprised of independent directors or by a majority of the independent directors on the board of directors.\nFollowing the Merger, the combined company intends to rely on some of these exemptions. As a result, the combined company may not have a majority of independent directors and its nominating and corporate governance committee and compensation committee may not consist entirely of independent directors. Accordingly, you will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements.\nMajesco and Cover-All will incur substantial transaction fees and costs in connection with the Merger.\nMajesco and Cover-All expect to incur material non-recurring expenses in connection with the Merger and consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger. Additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the course of the integration of the businesses of Majesco and Cover-All. The parties cannot be certain that the elimination of duplicative costs or the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the two businesses will offset the transaction and integration costs in the near term, or at all.\nThe Merger Agreement limits Cover-All\u2019s ability to pursue alternatives to the Merger, which could discourage a potential acquirer of Cover-All from making an alternative transaction proposal and, in certain circumstances, could require Cover-All to pay to Majesco a significant termination fee.\nUnder the Merger Agreement, Cover-All is restricted, subject to limited exceptions, from pursuing or entering into alternative transactions in lieu of the Merger. In general, unless and until the Merger Agreement is terminated, Cover-All is restricted from, among other things, soliciting, initiating or knowingly taking any action to facilitate or encourage a competing acquisition proposal. The board of directors of Cover-All is limited in its ability to change its recommendation with respect to the Merger. Cover-All may terminate the Merger Agreement and enter into an agreement with respect to a superior offer only if specified conditions have been satisfied, including (i) compliance with the non-solicitation provisions of the Merger Agreement, (ii) the expiration of certain waiting periods during which Majesco may propose changes to the Merger Agreement so the superior offer is no longer a superior offer and (iii) the payment of a termination fee in the amount of $2.5 million.\nFurthermore, Cover-All may also be required to pay Majesco a $2.5 million termination fee if it consummates another business combination within six months of the termination of the Merger under certain circumstances.\nThese provisions could discourage a third party that may have an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of Cover-All from considering or proposing such an acquisition, even if such third party were prepared to pay consideration with a higher per share cash or market value than the consideration proposed to be received or realized in the Merger, or might result in a potential acquirer proposing to pay a lower price than it would otherwise have proposed to pay because of the added expense of the termination fee that may become payable. As a result of these restrictions, Cover-All may not be able to enter into an agreement with respect to a more favorable alternative transaction without incurring potentially significant liability to Majesco.\nAfter consummation of the merger, the combined company will recognize identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair values which could be significantly lower than book values.\nAfter consummation of the merger, the combined company will recognize and measure the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the Merger at their fair values. The fair value is the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer the liability in an orderly transaction between market participants, irrespective of its intended use after consummation of the merger. In the process, a valuation of any intangible assets acquired, including internally developed software, will be performed and it could result in a fair value amount significantly lower than the Cover-All book value basis of capitalized software as at closing date of the merger.\nThe fairness opinion rendered to the board of directors of Cover-All by BVA will not reflect changes in circumstances, including general market and economic conditions or the prospects of Cover-All or Majesco, between the signing the Merger Agreement and the completion of the Merger.\nThe BVA Group LLC (\u201cBVA\u201d) has issued to the Cover-All board of directors a written opinion, as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, as of the date of execution of the Merger Agreement, of the terms of the Merger to the shareholders of Cover-All. Cover-All\u2019s board of directors has not obtained an updated fairness opinion as of the date of this annual report on Form 10-K. Importantly, the BVA opinion does not reflect changes that may occur or may have occurred after the date of the opinion, including changes in the operations, performance and prospects of Cover-All or Majesco, general market and economic conditions and other factors that may be beyond the control of Cover-All or Majesco, and on which the fairness opinion was based, that may alter the value of Cover-All or Majesco or the prices of shares of Cover-All common stock or Majesco common stock by the time the Merger is completed. The BVA opinion does not speak as of the time the Merger will be completed or as of any date other than the opinion date. Because Cover-All does not anticipate asking BVA to update its opinion, the opinion will not address the fairness of the terms of the Merger, including the Merger consideration, from a financial point of view, at the time the Merger is completed.\nLitigation may be instituted against Cover-All, members of the Cover-All board of directors, Majesco and members of the Majesco board of directors challenging the Merger, and adverse judgments in these lawsuits may prevent the Merger from becoming effective within the expected timeframe or at all.\nCover-All, members of the Cover-All board of directors, Majesco and members of the Majesco board of directors may be named as defendants in class action lawsuits or other proceedings that may be brought by Cover-All stockholders\nchallenging the Merger. If the plaintiffs in any actions that may be brought are successful, these adverse judgments may prevent the parties from completing the Merger in the expected timeframe, if at all. Even if the plaintiffs in these potential actions are not successful, the costs of defending against such claims could adversely affect the financial condition of Cover-All or Majesco and such actions could adversely affect the reputations of Cover-All and Majesco and members of their respective boards of directors or management.\nMajesco and Cover-All will be subject to various uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the Merger is pending that could adversely affect the financial results of Cover-All, Majesco and/or the combined company.\nUncertainty about the effect of the Merger on employees, suppliers and customers may have an adverse effect on Cover-All and/or Majesco. These uncertainties may impair Cover-All\u2019s and/or Majesco\u2019s ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the Merger is completed and for a period of time thereafter, and could cause customers, suppliers and others who deal with Cover-All or Majesco to seek to change existing business relationships with Cover-All or Majesco. Employee retention and recruitment may be particularly challenging prior to completion of the Merger, as employees and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company. The pursuit of the Merger and the preparation for the integration of the two companies may place a significant burden on management and internal resources of Cover-All and Majesco. Any significant diversion of Cover-All\u2019s and Majesco\u2019s management attention away from their respective ongoing businesses, and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process, could affect the financial results of Cover-All, Majesco and/or the combined company.\nIn addition, the Merger Agreement restricts Cover-All, without the consent of Majesco, from making certain acquisitions and dispositions and taking other specified actions while the Merger is pending. These restrictions may prevent Cover-All from pursuing attractive business opportunities and making other changes to their respective businesses prior to completion of the Merger or termination of the Merger Agreement.\nThe financial performance, and price of the common stock, of the combined company may be affected by factors different from those that historically have affected Cover-All.\nUpon completion of the Merger, holders of Cover-All common stock will become holders of common stock of the combined company. The business and target markets of the Majesco and the combined company differ from those of Cover-All, and accordingly the results of operations and the price of the common stock of the combined company will be affected by some factors that are different from those currently affecting the results of operations and stock price of Cover-All.\nThe shares of Majesco common stock to be received by Cover-All shareholders as a result of the Merger will have different rights from the shares of Cover-All common stock.\nUpon completion of the Merger, Cover-All shareholders will become stockholders of the combined company and their rights as stockholders will be governed by Majesco\u2019s articles of incorporation and bylaws. The combined company will be a California corporation and certain of the rights associated with the combined company common stock will be different from the rights associated with Cover-All common stock.\nThe combined company may not experience the anticipated strategic benefits of the Merger.\nThe respective management of Cover-All and Majesco believe that the Merger would provide certain strategic benefits that may not be realized by each of the companies operating as standalones. Specifically, we believe the Merger would provide certain strategic benefits which would enable each of Cover-All and Majesco to accelerate their respective business plans through an increased access to capital in the public equity markets, increased management strength and management expertise, access to a larger customer base for the combined sales organization and ability to develop and acquire new solutions targeting significant trends in the convergence between technology and insurance. There can be no assurance that these anticipated benefits of the Merger will materialize or that if they materialize will result in increased shareholder value or revenue stream to the combined company.\nCover-All and Majesco may be unable to successfully integrate their operations following the Merger.\nIt is possible that the integration process could take longer than anticipated and could result in the loss of valuable employees, the disruption of each company\u2019s ongoing businesses, processes and systems or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, practices, policies and compensation arrangements, any of which could adversely affect the combined\ncompany\u2019s ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the Merger. The combined company\u2019s results of operations could also be adversely affected by any issues attributable to either company\u2019s operations that arise or are based on events or actions that occur prior to the closing of the Merger. The companies may have difficulty addressing possible differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies. The integration process is subject to a number of uncertainties, and no assurance can be given that the anticipated benefits will be realized or, if realized, the timing of their realization. Failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs or decreases in the amount of expected revenues and could adversely affect the combined company\u2019s future business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nThe lack of a public market for Majesco\u2019s shares makes it difficult to evaluate the fairness of the Merger, thus the stockholders of Cover-All may receive consideration in the Merger that is greater than or less than the fair market value of their Cover-All shares.\nThe outstanding common stock of Majesco is privately held and is not traded in any public market. The lack of a public market makes it extremely difficult to determine the fair market value of Majesco. Because the percentage of Cover-All common stock to be issued to Majesco stockholders was determined based on negotiations between the parties, it is possible that the value of the combined company common stock to be issued in connection with the Merger may be less than expected.\nIf the conditions to the completion of the Merger are not met, the Merger will not occur.\nEven if the Merger is approved by the stockholders of Cover-All, additional specific conditions must be satisfied or waived (to the extent permitted under applicable law) in order to complete the Merger, including, among others:\n\u00b7 Majesco\u2019s Registration Statement on Form S-4 shall have become effective, and no stop order suspending effectiveness shall have been issued and remain in effect,\n\u00b7 the completion of the Majesco Reorganization,\n\u00b7 the shares of Majesco common stock issuable to Cover-All\u2019s stockholders in the Merger in accordance with the Merger Agreement will have been authorized for listing on the NYSE MKT,\n\u00b7 no governmental entity shall have enacted any law or order making illegal or otherwise restricting, preventing or prohibiting consummation of the Merger or the other transactions by the Merger Agreement and no such law or order shall be pending,\n\u00b7 the representations and warranties of each party to the Merger Agreement shall be true and correct subject to certain materiality qualifiers,\n\u00b7 there shall be no material adverse effect on either party,\n\u00b7 tax legal opinions shall have been obtained,\n\u00b7 the affirmative vote of the holders of the outstanding shares of Majesco common stock in accordance with California law and Majesco\u2019s Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws will have been obtained, and\n\u00b7 Manish D. Shah shall remain with Cover-All and shall have entered into a new employment agreement at the Effective Time.\nThese and other conditions are described in detail in the Merger Agreement. We cannot assure you that all of the conditions to the Merger will be satisfied. If the conditions to the Merger are not satisfied or waived (to the extent permitted under applicable law), the Merger will not occur or will be delayed, and Cover-All may lose some or all of the intended benefits of the Merger.\nDelays in completing the Merger may substantially reduce the expected benefits of the Merger.\nSatisfying the conditions to, and completion of, the Merger may take longer than, and could cost more than, Majesco and Cover-All expect. Any delay in completing or any additional conditions imposed in order to complete the Merger may materially adversely affect the benefits that Majesco and Cover-All expect to achieve from the Merger and the integration of\ntheir respective businesses. In addition, either of Cover-All and Majesco may terminate the Merger Agreement on notice to the other if the Merger is not completed by July 30, 2015.\nShould the Merger not qualify as tax free reorganization, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, Cover-All stockholders and the combined company may recognize income, gain or loss in connection with the Merger.\nIt is expected that the Merger will qualify as a tax-free reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The parties, however, did not seek a ruling from the IRS regarding the tax consequences of the Merger. The failure of the Merger to qualify as a tax-free reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes could result in a Cover-All stockholder recognizing income, gain or loss with respect to the shares of Cover-All common stock surrendered by such stockholder. The failure of the Merger to qualify as a tax-free reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes also could result in the recognition of income and gain by Cover-All, which could adversely affect the performance of the business of the combined company following the Merger.\nFailure or delay in obtaining any necessary regulatory approvals could cause the Merger not to be completed or to be postponed.\nTo complete the Merger and all transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the Merger, Majesco must comply with applicable federal and state securities laws and the rules and regulations of the NYSE MKT in connection with the issuance and listing of shares of Majesco common stock and the filing of this annual report on Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Cover-All must also comply with such securities laws in connection with the filing of this annual report on Form 10-K and the solicitation of proxies from its shareholders. Additionally, Majesco must obtain approval of the High Courts in Mumbai and Gujarat, India for the consummation of the Majesco Reorganization and such consummation is a condition to the completion of the Merger. All such approvals are currently expected to be obtained by May 2015, but neither Cover-All nor Majesco can assure you that such approvals will be obtained by such date, or at all. Failure or delay in obtaining any necessary approvals could cause the Merger not to be completed or to be postponed, which may materially adversely affect the benefits that Majesco and Cover-All expect to achieve from the Merger and the integration of their respective businesses.\nCover-All stockholders will not be entitled to appraisal rights in the Merger.\nCurrent holders of Cover-All common stock will not be entitled to dissenters\u2019 or appraisal rights in the Merger with respect to their shares of Cover-All common stock under Delaware law. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time, each share of Cover-All common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares owned by Cover-All or its wholly-owned subsidiary, Cover-All Subsidiary, which will be cancelled at the Effective Time without further consideration) will be automatically cancelled and extinguished and converted into the right to receive the number of shares of Majesco common stock multiplied by the Exchange Ratio.\nThe combined company may expand through acquisitions of or partnerships with other companies, which may divert management\u2019s attention and result in unexpected operating and technology integration difficulties, increased costs and dilution to our stockholders.\nThe combined company\u2019s business strategy may include additional acquisitions of complementary software, technologies or businesses or alliances with other companies offering related services or products. Acquisitions and alliances may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. In particular, the combined company may encounter difficulties in assimilating or integrating the businesses, technologies, services, products, personnel or operations of the acquired companies, the key personnel of the acquired company may choose not to work for the combined company. The combined company may also have difficulty retaining existing customers or signing new customers of any acquired business. Acquisitions and alliances may also disrupt the combined company\u2019s ongoing business, divert resources and require significant management attention that would otherwise be available for ongoing development of its current business.\nThe combined company may not be able to meet the listing standards to trade on the NYSE MKT or other national securities exchange, which could adversely affect the liquidity and price of the combined company\u2019s common stock.\nIt is a condition to the consummation of the Merger that the stock of the combined company be listed on the NYSE MKT following the Merger. The listing qualification standards for new issuers are stringent and, although the combined\ncompany may explore various actions to meet the minimum listing requirements, there is no guarantee that any such actions will be successful in bringing it into compliance with the requirements of the NYSE MKT or other national securities exchange. Even if the stock of the combined company is listed on the NYSE MKT, no assurance can be given that the combined company will comply with the requirements for continued listing set by the NYSE MKT at all times in the future. If the combined company fails to comply with the requirements for continued listing set by the NYSE MKT, the combined company could be delisted from the NYSE MKT, which could have a material adverse effect on its business and financial condition.\nIf the combined company fails to achieve listing of its common stock on the NYSE MKT or a national securities exchange, the Merger may not close. If it closes, the combined company\u2019s common shares may be traded on the OTC Bulletin Board or other over-the-counter markets in the United States, although there can be no assurance that its common shares will be eligible for trading on any such alternative markets or exchanges in the United States. In the event that the Merger closes but the combined company is not able to obtain a listing on a national securities exchange or quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board or other quotation service for its common shares, it may be extremely difficult or impossible for stockholders to sell their common shares in the United States. Moreover, if the common stock of the combined company is quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board or other over-the-counter market, the liquidity will likely be less, and therefore the price will be more volatile, than if its common stock were listed on a national securities exchange. Stockholders may not be able to sell their common shares in the quantities, at the times, or at the prices that could potentially be available on a more liquid trading market. As a result of these factors, if the combined company\u2019s common shares fail to achieve listing on a national securities exchange, the price of its common shares is likely to decline. In addition, a decline in the price of the combined company\u2019s common shares could impair its ability to achieve a national securities exchange listing or to obtain financing in the future.\nThe combined company\u2019s stock price is expected to be volatile, and the market price of the combined company common stock may drop following the Merger.\nThe market price of the combined company\u2019s common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations following the Merger. Moreover, stock markets generally have experienced substantial volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of individual companies. Such market fluctuations may also adversely affect the trading price of the combined company\u2019s common stock. Declines in the combined company\u2019s stock price after the Merger may result for a number of reasons including if:\n\u00b7 investors react negatively to the prospects of the combined company\u2019s business and prospects from the Merger;\n\u00b7 the effects of the Merger on the combined company\u2019s business and prospects are not consistent with the expectations of financial or industry analysts;\n\u00b7 the combined company does not achieve the perceived benefits of the Merger as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by financial or industry analysts; or\n\u00b7 other factors beyond the combined company\u2019s control, including but not limited to fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to the combined company.\nFurthermore, the stock markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political and market conditions, such as recessions, interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations, have and may continue to negatively affect the market price of our common stock.\nDeclines in the combined company\u2019s stock price or financial results could give rise to stockholder litigation and potential liability.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, stockholders have often instituted class action securities litigation against those companies. Such litigation, if instituted, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management attention and resources, which could significantly harm the combined company\u2019s profitability and reputation.\nA significant portion of the combined company\u2019s unaudited pro forma total assets consists of deferred tax assets, which is subject to a management estimates, and a significant change in business operation may affect any future realization of the deferred tax assets.\nAs part of the process of preparing consolidated pro forma statements, the combined company will be required to estimate our provision for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we conduct business, in accordance with Topic 740 (Income Taxes) of the Financial Accounting Standards Board\u2019s Accounting Standards Codification. Income taxes are accounted for using an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized. The factors the combined company will use to assess the likelihood of realization include management\u2019s forecast of the reversal of temporary differences, future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets. Should a change in circumstances lead to a change in judgment about the utilization of deferred tax assets in future years, the combined company would adjust related valuation allowances in the period that the change in circumstances occurs, along with a corresponding increase or charge to income. Changes in recognized tax benefits and changes in valuation allowances could be material to the combined company\u2019s results of operations for any period, but is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial position.\nDue to the Merger, the ability of the combined company to use the net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) of Cover-All to offset future taxable income may be restricted and a vast majority of the tax benefits from these NOLs are not expected to be transferrable to the combined company following the Merger.\nAs of December 31, 2014, Cover-All had federal net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, of approximately $9.9 million due to prior period losses. In general, under Section 382 of the Code, a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its NOLs to offset future taxable income. If the Merger is completed, Cover-All\u2019s existing NOLs may be subject to limitations and the combined company may not be able to fully use these NOLs to offset future taxable income. In addition, if the combined company undergoes any subsequent ownership change, its ability to utilize NOLs could be further limited. There is also a risk that, due to regulatory changes, such as suspensions on the use of NOLs, or for other unforeseen reasons, existing NOLs could expire or otherwise be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities. Moreover, the ability to use Cover-All\u2019s NOLs may be further limited by ownership changes of Cover-All that arose prior to the Merger. For these reasons, the vast majority of the tax benefits from the use of Cover-All\u2019s NOLs are not expected to be transferrable to the combined company following completion of the Merger.\nHolders of the combined company\u2019s common stock will experience dilution as a result of the exercise of the Loan Transaction Warrants.\nUnder the Merger Agreement, any issued and outstanding warrants to purchase shares of Cover-All common stock that are not exercised or cancelled prior to the Effective Time will be assumed by the combined company in accordance with their terms. In connection with a loan transaction with Imperium, Cover-All issued five-year warrants to purchase, in the aggregate, 1,442,000 shares of Cover-All common stock to Imperium and Cover-All\u2019s financial advisor (collectively, the \u201cLoan Transaction Warrants\u201d). Each Loan Transaction Warrant provides (x) for adjustments to the exercise price and the number of shares issuable upon exercise in certain events to protect against dilution and (y) for cashless exercise. The Loan Transaction Warrants will become exercisable upon consummation of the Merger. The issuance of additional shares of common stock of the combined company as a consequence of the exercise of any of the Loan Transaction Warrants may result in significant dilution to stockholders of the combined company.\nSales or new issuances of a substantial number of shares of the combined company\u2019s common stock in the public market could cause its stock price to fall.\nSales by shareholders, or new issuances by the combined company, of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. These sales, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of the combined company\u2019s common stock. Majesco\u2019s management also intends to register all shares of common stock that the combined company may issue under its\nequity compensation plans. Once the combined company registers these shares, they can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance, subject to volume limitations applicable to affiliates and other requirements of applicable law.\nA significant portion of the combined company\u2019s unaudited pro forma total assets consists of goodwill, which is subject to a periodic impairment analysis, and a significant impairment determination in any future period could have an adverse effect on the combined company\u2019s results of operations even without a significant loss of revenue or increase in cash expenses attributable to such period.\nThe combined company will have significant goodwill upon consummation of the Merger. The combined company will be required to evaluate this goodwill for impairment based on the fair value of the operating business units to which this goodwill relates at least once a year. This estimated fair value could change if the combined company is unable to achieve operating results at the levels that have been forecasted, the market valuation of those business units decreases based on transactions involving similar companies, or there is a permanent, negative change in the market demand for the services offered by the business units. These changes could result in an impairment of the existing goodwill balance that could require a material non-cash charge to our results of operations.\nThe combined company is not expected to pay dividends on its shares of common stock in the foreseeable future.\nThe combined company is not expected to pay dividends on its shares of common stock in the foreseeable future. Instead, for the foreseeable future, it is expected that the combined company will continue to retain any earnings to finance the development and expansion of its business, and not to pay any cash dividends on its common stock. Consequently, your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment in the combined company will be if the market price of the common stock appreciates and you sell your shares at a profit. There is no guarantee that the price of the combined company common stock that will prevail in the market after the Merger will ever exceed the value of the Cover-All common stock exchanged in the Merger.\nMajesco, the surviving corporation in the Merger, has never previously been a US reporting company.\nMajesco, which will be the surviving corporation in the Merger, has never previously been a reporting company in the United States subject to U.S. federal and state securities laws, including the reporting obligations of the Exchange Act and other requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The combined company will be required to increase its compliance efforts and incur significant costs in connection with complying with public company requirements under U.S. federal and state securities laws. The attention of management may be diverted on a frequent basis in order to carry out public company reporting and related obligations, rather than directing their full time and attention to the operation and growth of the business. Employees and some members of the management team have had limited experience working for a US reporting company, increasing the risk of non-compliance. The combined company\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud or misconduct by persons inside or outside the combined company. Similarly, if the combined company fails to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, the combined company may not be able to accurately report its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Noncompliance with U.S. federal and state securities laws and other regulatory requirements could result in administrative or other penalties or civil or criminal judgments against the combined company or harm to the combined company\u2019s reputation. These consequences could affect investor confidence in the combined company and cause the price of the stock to decline, result in the delisting of the combined company\u2019s shares from the NYSE MKT, require the payment of fines or other amounts, distract management\u2019s time and attention to the business or result in the loss of customer or supplier relationships, thus reducing the value of the combined company\u2019s common stock.\nThe combined company will incur increased costs as a result of operating as a larger public company, and its management will be required to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives.\nAs a public company that is no longer a smaller reporting company, the combined company will incur higher legal, accounting and other expenses than before, and these expenses may increase even more in the future. The combined company will be subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Protection Act, as well as rules adopted, and to be adopted, by the SEC and the NYSE MKT, except to the extent certain exemptions apply during the period the combined company is an emerging growth company (an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d) under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the \u201cJOBS Act\u201d). The combined company\u2019s management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Majesco\u2019s management estimates that the combined company may incur approximately $1.5 to $2.0 million in incremental costs per year associated with being a publicly traded company, although it is possible that the combined company\u2019s actual incremental costs will be higher than management currently estimates. These expenses may increase even more after the combined company is no longer an emerging growth company and is therefore no longer eligible for certain exemptions or reduced reporting requirements.\nThe combined company\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud.\nMajesco as a private company was has never been subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. Therefore, there can be no assurances that the combined company will be fully compliant with its disclosure controls and procedures under the Exchange Act. Any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the controls. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in the combined company\u2019s control system, misstatements or insufficient disclosures due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nIf the combined company fails to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting in the future, the combined company may not be able to accurately report its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, which may adversely affect investor confidence in the combined company and, as a result, the value of its common stock.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that the combined company maintain effective internal controls for financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. The combined company will be required to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting. This assessment will need to include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by its management in the combined company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting that results in more than a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act also generally requires an attestation from the combined company\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting. However, for as long as the combined company remains an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act, the combined company may take advantage of the exemption permitting it not to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement.\nThe combined company\u2019s compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act will require that it incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management efforts. The combined company may not be able to complete its evaluation, testing and any required remediation in a timely fashion. During the evaluation and testing process, if the combined company identifies one or more material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting, the combined company will be unable to assert that its internal control over financial reporting is effective. The combined company cannot assure you that there will not be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in its internal control over financial reporting in the future. Any failure to maintain internal control over financial reporting could severely inhibit the combined company\u2019s ability to accurately report its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. If the combined company is unable to conclude that its internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if its independent registered public accounting firm determines the combined company has a material weakness or significant deficiency in its internal control over financial reporting once that firm begin its Section 404 reviews, the combined company could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of its financial reports, the market price of its common stock could decline, and the combined company could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the NYSE MKT, the SEC or other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in the combined company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain other effective control systems required of public companies, could also restrict its future access to the capital markets.\nThe combined company will be an emerging growth company under U.S. securities laws and intends to take advantage of reduced disclosure and governance requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, which could result in its common stock being less attractive to investors.\nThe combined company will be an emerging growth company, and may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are otherwise applicable to public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to:\n\u00b7 a requirement to provide only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related selected financial data and management\u2019s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations disclosure;\n\u00b7 not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements regarding internal controls under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;\n\u00b7 reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in periodic reports and proxy statements; and\n\u00b7 exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding shareholder advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nThe combined company also intends to take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies provided under the JOBS Act. Section 102 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to elect the extended transition period for complying with new or revised financial accounting standards is irrevocable. As a result, the combined company\u2019s financial statements may not be\ncomparable to those of companies that comply with public company effective dates for complying with new or revised accounting standards.\nMoreover, the combined company will also be eligible under the JOBS Act for an exemption from compliance with any requirement that the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board may adopt regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or supplements to the auditor\u2019s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements.\nThe combined company cannot predict if investors will find its common stock less attractive because the combined company will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find the combined company\u2019s common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for its common stock and its stock price may be more volatile.\nThe combined company may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until the combined company is no longer an emerging growth company, which in certain circumstances could be for up to five years.\nThe combined company\u2019s status as an emerging growth company may make it more difficult to raise capital as and when the combined company needs it.\nBecause of the exemptions from various reporting requirements available to it as an emerging growth company the combined company may be less attractive to investors and it may be difficult for it to raise additional capital as and when the combined company needs it. Investors may be unable to compare the combined company\u2019s business with other companies in its industry if they believe that its financial accounting is not as transparent as other companies in its industry. If the combined company is unable to raise additional capital as and when the combined company needs it, the combined company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nThe combined company will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (a) the last day of the first fiscal year in which its annual gross revenues exceed $1.0 billion, (b) the date that it becomes a \u201clarge accelerated filer\u201d as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of its shares that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of the combined company\u2019s most recently completed second fiscal quarter, (c) the date on which it has issued more than $1.0 billion in nonconvertible debt securities during the preceding three-year period and (d) the last day of the combined company\u2019s fiscal year containing the fifth anniversary of the date on which shares of its common stock are offered in connection with the completion of the Merger.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about the combined company or its business, its common stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for the combined company\u2019s common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about the combined company or its business. Securities and industry analysts do not currently, and may never, publish research on the combined company. If no securities or industry analysts commence coverage of the combined company, the trading price for its common stock would likely be negatively impacted. In the event securities or industry analysts initiate coverage, if one or more of the analysts who cover the combined company downgrade its securities or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about its business, its stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of the combined company or fail to publish reports on the combined company regularly, demand for its common stock could decrease, which might cause its common stock price and trading volume to decline.\nOur product development and continuing planned operations require a substantial amount of capital. Future sales and issuances of common stock or rights to purchase common stock by the combined company, including pursuant to equity incentive plans, could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of stockholders and could cause the common stock price to fall.\nThe combined company expects that significant additional capital will be needed in the future to continue planned operations, including product development, which requires consistent high levels of investments. To raise capital, the combined company may sell substantial amounts of common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock. These future issuances of common stock or common stock-related securities, together with the exercise of stock options, warrants, RSUs and any additional shares issued in connection with acquisitions, if any, may result in material dilution to investors. Such sales may also result in material dilution to the combined company\u2019s existing stockholders, and\nnew investors could gain rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of the combined company\u2019s common stock, including shares of common stock sold in this offering.\nRaising capital for ongoing operations and product development by issuing securities may cause dilution to existing stockholders, restrict the combined company\u2019s business or require the combined company to relinquish rights.\nAdditional financing for ongoing operations may not be available to the combined company when it needs it or may not be available on favorable terms. To the extent that the combined company raises additional capital by issuing equity securities, existing stockholders\u2019 ownership will be diluted and the terms of any new equity securities may have preferences over its common stock. Any debt financing may involve covenants that restrict operations. These restrictive covenants may include limitations on additional borrowing and specific restrictions on the use of the combined company\u2019s assets, as well as prohibitions on its ability to create additional liens, pay dividends, redeem its stock or make investments.\nAnti-takeover and similar provisions of California law and Majesco\u2019s governing documents may deter or prevent a future acquisition or change of control of the combined company that our shareholders may consider favorable.\nAnti-takeover and similar provisions of California law and of Majesco\u2019s governing documents could make it more difficult for a third party, or an existing shareholder, to engage in a business combination with or acquire control of the combined company, even if shareholders may consider such transaction to be favorable to them. Such provisions may have the effect of discouraging a hostile bid, or delaying, preventing or deterring a merger, acquisition or tender offer in which the combined company\u2019s shareholders could receive a premium for their shares, or effect a proxy contest for control of the combined company or other changes in its management, particularly if such proposed transaction is opposed by the board of directors of the combined company.\nUnder Section 1203 of the CGCL, if an \u201cinterested person\u201d makes an offer to purchase the shares of some or all of the combined company\u2019s shareholders, the combined company must obtain an affirmative opinion in writing as to the fairness of the offering price prior to completing the transaction. If after receiving an offer from such an \u201cinterested person\u201d the combined company receives a subsequent offer from a neutral third party, then the combined company must notify its shareholders of this offer and afford each of them the opportunity to withdraw their consent to the \u201cinterested person\u201d offer.\nMoreover, even if shareholders may consider such a transaction to be favorable to them, the CGCL may effectively prohibit a cash-out merger of minority shareholders by a majority shareholder of the combined company without the unanimous approval of the merger by the combined company\u2019s shareholders, which is often difficult to achieve in the case of a public company. Under Sections 1101 and 1101.1 of the CGCL, a merger with a majority shareholder for cash consideration requires unanimous shareholder approval, except where (i) the party interested in effecting the merger already owns 90% or more of the voting power of the combined company (and could, therefore, accomplish such a cash-out of minority shareholders by means of a \u201cshort-form\u201d merger without the need for approval by the combined company\u2019s shareholders) or (ii) the California Commissioner of Corporations has granted its consent. In addition, under the combined company\u2019s articles of incorporation and bylaws, certain provisions may make it difficult for a third party to acquire the combined company, or for a change in the composition of the board of directors or management to occur.", "PERMNO": 81510, "SIC": 7372, "TIC": "COVR"}
