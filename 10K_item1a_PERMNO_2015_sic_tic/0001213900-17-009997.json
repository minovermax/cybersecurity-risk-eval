{"cik": "1514131", "company": "United Community Bancorp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-09-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in shares of our common stock involves various risks. Before deciding to invest in our common stock, you should carefully consider the risks described below in conjunction with the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the items included as exhibits. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed by any of the following risks or by other risks that have not been identified or that we may believe are immaterial or unlikely. The value or market price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks. The risks discussed below also include forward-looking statements, and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements.\nOur nonperforming assets expose us to increased risk of loss.\nOur nonperforming assets totaled $3.0 million, or 0.56% of total assets at June 30, 2017 and were comprised of $2.9 million of nonperforming loans and $93,000 of other real estate owned. This total represents an increase of $61,000 from the June 30, 2016 total of $3.0 million. The increase in nonperforming assets in fiscal year 2017 was primarily the result of the additions of new nonperforming loans in the current year partially offset by reductions due to loan payoffs, foreclosures, payments and movements of such loans to accruing status. Troubled debt restructurings are considered to be impaired loans. Our troubled debt restructurings decreased from $3.7 million at June 30, 2016 to $2.6 million at June 30, 2017, $1.3 million of which were on nonaccrual status and included in nonperforming loans. At June 30, 2016, $1.4 million of troubled debt restructurings were on nonaccrual status and included in nonperforming loans.\nOur nonperforming assets adversely affect our net income in various ways. We do not accrue interest income on non-accrual loans and no interest income is recognized until the loan is performing for an established period of time and the value of the underlying collateral supports recording interest income. We must reserve for probable losses, which are established through a current period charge to income in the provision for loan losses, and from time to time, write down the value of properties in our other real estate owned portfolio to reflect changing market values. Write-downs to other real estate owned are typically charged directly to the income statement, which would have a negative impact on net income. Additionally, there are legal fees associated with the resolution of problem assets as well as carrying costs such as taxes, insurance and maintenance related to our other real estate owned. Further, the resolution of nonperforming assets requires the active involvement of senior management, which can result in more time being devoted to resolution and less time devoted to overall supervision of operations and other income-producing activities of including new business opportunities. Finally, if our estimate of the allowance for loan losses is insufficient, we will have to increase the allowance accordingly through earnings. At June 30, 2017, our allowance for loan losses was $4.3 million, or 1.5% of total loans and 146.8% of nonperforming loans, compared to $4.9 million, or 1.8% of total loans and 169.2% of nonperforming loans at June 30, 2016.\nOur multi-family and nonresidential real estate loans expose us to increased credit risks.\nAt June 30, 2017, our nonresidential real estate and multi-family real estate loans totaled $74.8 million and $15.4 million, respectively, or 26.2% and 5.4%, respectively, of our total loans outstanding. Nonresidential and multi-family real estate loans represented 37.7% and 0%, respectively, of our total nonperforming assets of $3.0 million at June 30, 2017. Our current strategy is to continue to execute on our controlled growth strategy by prudently growing multi-family residential and nonresidential real estate loans as well as other loan categories. We plan to continue to limit our exposure to loans involving properties outside of our local market area. These types of loans generally expose a lender to greater risk of non-payment and loss than one- to four-family mortgage loans because repayment of the loans often depends on the successful operation of the property and the income stream of the borrowers. Such loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to one- to four-family mortgage loans. Also, some of our multi-family and nonresidential real estate and land borrowers have more than one loan outstanding with us. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a one- to four-family mortgage loan. During the year ended June 30, 2017, we experienced no charge-offs on multi-family real estate loans and $17,000 in recoveries resulting in a net recovery of $17,000. During the year ended June 30, 2017, we experienced charge offs of $600,000 on nonresidential real estate loans, offset by $248,000 of recoveries resulting in net charge-offs of $352,000.\nWe implemented a controlled loan growth strategy starting in 2014.\nPrior to the quarter ended December 31, 2013, we deemphasized the origination of nonresidential and multi-family real estate loans as a strategic focus, particularly outside of Dearborn and Ripley Counties in Indiana. From June 30, 2006 through June 30, 2010, we experienced asset growth in excess of 38% in large part due to a determination to increase the size of our nonresidential and multi-family real estate portfolios and expand our lending efforts to southwestern Ohio and Northern Kentucky. While these lending areas are geographically proximate to the southeastern Indiana marketplace, the southwestern Ohio and Northern Kentucky real estate markets were more negatively impacted by the economic downturn. As a result, our loan relationships in these markets experienced disproportionate loan losses and required an extraordinary investment of managerial time to monitor in order to mitigate losses on these credits. In response, management elected to deemphasize multi-family and nonresidential lending in all markets until the economies in each of these markets materially improved and the level of our nonperforming assets in these segments of our loan portfolio materially declined. This strategy caused our one- to four-family residential mortgage loan portfolio and our investment securities portfolio to increase as a percentage of our interest-earning assets. At June 30, 2017, our nonresidential real estate and multi-family real estate loan portfolios totaled $90.2 million, or 16.8% of total assets, compared to $74.9 million, or 14.2% of total assets at June 30, 2016, and $124.3 million, or 25.3% of total assets, at June 30, 2010.\nWe reviewed the economic environment in our lending markets, including those in southwestern Ohio and Northern Kentucky, and the level of our nonperforming assets, and beginning in December 2013, we implemented a controlled growth strategy to prudently increase nonresidential real estate and multi-family real estate loan portfolios to generate more interest income. Starting in 2014, we hired experienced commercial lenders and credit staff to enhance our capacity to implement this strategy of prudently growing the commercial and commercial real estate portfolios.\nA significant amount of our troubled debt restructurings are subject to balloon payments due in the next three years.\nAt June 30, 2017, troubled debt restructurings totaling $1.2 million were subject to balloon payments that must be repaid within the next three years. If the financial position of the borrowers of these loans is not sufficient to enable the borrowers to satisfy their balloon payments, we may have to further restructure the loans or foreclose and liquidate the collateral, which could result in an increase in non-accrual loans and/or additional provisions for loan losses.\nHigher loan losses could require us to increase our allowance for loan losses through a charge to earnings.\nWhen we extend credit, we incur the risk that our borrowers will not repay their loans according to the contractual terms. We reserve for loan losses by establishing an allowance through a charge to earnings. The amount of this allowance is based on our assessment of loan losses inherent in our loan portfolio. The process for determining the amount of the allowance is critical to our financial results and condition. It requires subjective and complex judgments about the future, including forecasts of economic or market conditions that might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans. We might underestimate the loan losses inherent in our loan portfolio and have loan losses in excess of the amount reserved. We might increase the allowance because of changing economic conditions. For example, in a rising interest rate environment, borrowers with adjustable-rate loans could see their payments increase. There may be a significant increase in the number of borrowers who are unable or unwilling to repay their loans, resulting in an elevated level of charge-offs, which could require an increase to the allowance. In addition, when real estate values decline, the potential severity of loss on a real estate-secured loan can increase significantly, especially in the case of loans with higher loan-to-value ratios. The decline in the national economy and the local economies of the areas in which our loans are concentrated could result in an increase in loan delinquencies, foreclosures or repossessions, resulting in elevated charge-off levels and the need for additional loan loss provisions in future periods. In addition, our determination as to the amount of our allowance for loan losses is subject to review by our primary regulator, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency referred to as the OCC, as part of its examination process, which may result in the establishment of an additional allowance based upon the judgment of the OCC after a review of the information available at the time of its examination. Our allowance for loan losses amounted to 1.50% of total loans and 146.8% of nonperforming loans at June 30, 2017.\nOur emphasis on one- to four-family mortgage loans exposes us to credit risks.\nAt June 30, 2017, $144.3 million, or 50.5%, of our loan portfolio consisted of one- to four-family mortgage loans, and $30.7 million, or 10.75%, of our loan portfolio consisted of home equity loans and second mortgage loans. Recent economic conditions have resulted in a stabilization in real estate values in our market areas. If real estate values in our market area decline, real estate values could cause some of our mortgage and home equity loans to be inadequately collateralized, which would expose us to a greater risk of loss if we seek to recover on defaulted loans by foreclosure and liquidation of the real estate collateral.\nOur primary market area depends substantially on the gaming industry and a decline in that industry could hurt our business and our prospects.\nOur business is concentrated in the Lawrenceburg, Indiana area. Since the mid-1990s, the economy in Lawrenceburg has been strengthened by the riverboat casinos in Lawrenceburg and nearby Rising Sun whose presence has supported the development of retail centers and job growth as well as an increase in housing development. Any event that negatively and materially impacts the gaming and tourism industry will adversely impact the Lawrenceburg economy.\nGaming revenue is vulnerable to fluctuations in the local and national economies. There has been a slow and steady recovery in the national economy since 2009. The impact from the last recession on Lawrenceburg and its gaming industry was not as significant as in other parts of the country. However, tax revenue from the gaming industry has decreased in recent years due to increased competition from the nearby Ohio markets.\nA continued deterioration in economic conditions generally, and a slowdown in gaming and tourism activities in particular, could result in the following consequences, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects and expose us to a greater risk of loss:\n\u25cf Loan delinquencies may increase;\n\u25cf Problem assets and foreclosures may increase;\n\u25cf Demand for our products and services may decline; and\n\u25cf Collateral for loans made by us may decline in value, reducing the amount of money that our customers may borrow against the collateral, and reducing the value of assets and collateral associated with our loans.\nThe expansion of permissible gaming activities in other states, particularly in Ohio and/or Kentucky, has led to a decline, and may lead to further declines in gaming revenue in Lawrenceburg, Indiana, which could hurt our business and our prospects.\nLawrenceburg, Indiana competes with other areas of the country for gaming revenue. The expansion of gaming operations in other states, as a result of changes in laws or otherwise, has reduced gaming revenue in the Lawrenceburg area. In 2009, a vote in the State of Ohio approved casino gaming in several cities in the state, including one in downtown Cincinnati, Ohio which opened in March 2013. Casino gaming in Cincinnati and other areas has adversely affected, and could have a substantial adverse effect on, gaming revenue in Lawrenceburg, which would adversely affect the Lawrenceburg economy and could adversely affect our business.\nChanges in interest rates could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur primary source of income is net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income generated by our interest-earning assets (consisting primarily of loans and, to a lesser extent, investment securities) and the interest expense generated by our interest-bearing liabilities (consisting primarily of deposits and, to a lesser extent, wholesale borrowings).\nThe level of net interest income is a function of the average balance of our interest-earning assets, the average balance of our interest-bearing liabilities, the average rate earned on interest-earning assets and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. These factors are influenced by both the pricing and mix of our interest-earning assets and our interest-bearing liabilities which, in turn, are affected by such external factors as the local economy, competition for loans and deposits, the monetary policy of the Federal Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve Board (FOMC) and market interest rates across the treasury curve.\nThe cost of our deposits and short-term wholesale borrowings is largely based on short-term interest rates, the level of which is heavily influenced by the FOMC. However, the yields on our loans and securities are typically based on intermediate-term or long-term interest rates, which are set by the market and generally, vary daily. The level of net interest income is therefore influenced by movements in interest rates and the pace at which such movements occur. If the interest rates on our interest-bearing liabilities increase at a faster pace than the interest rates on our interest-earning assets, the result could be a reduction in net interest income and a reduction in our earnings. Our net interest income and earnings would be similarly impacted were the interest rates on our interest-earning assets to decline more quickly than the interest rates on our interest-bearing liabilities.\nIn addition, such changes in interest rates could affect our ability to originate loans and attract and retain deposits at the preferred pricing levels, the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities, and the duration of our loan and securities portfolios.\nChanges in interest rates could also have an effect on the slope of the yield curve. A flat or inverted yield curve could cause our net interest income to decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our net income and cash flows and the value of our assets.\nChanges in interest rates particularly affect the value of our securities portfolio. Generally, the value of fixed-rate securities fluctuates inversely with changes in market interest rates. Unrealized gains and losses on securities available-for-sale are reported as a separate component of equity, net of tax. Decreases in the fair value of securities available-for-sale resulting from increases in interest rates could have an adverse effect on stockholders\u2019 equity. In addition, we invest in callable securities that expose us to reinvestment risk, particularly during periods of falling market interest rates when issuers of callable securities have an economic incentive to call their securities and reissue at a lower rate. In this scenario, we may have to reinvest the proceeds from called securities at lower rates of return than the rates earned on the called securities, which could have an adverse impact on our earnings.\nA majority of our real estate loans held for investment are adjustable-rate loans. Any rise in market interest rates may result in increased payments for borrowers who have adjustable-rate mortgage loans, increasing the possibility of default. In addition, although adjustable-rate mortgage loans help make our loan portfolio more responsive to upward changes in interest rates, the extent of this interest sensitivity is limited by the annual and lifetime interest rate adjustment limits. At June 30, 2017, approximately 35.7% of our one-to-four family real estate loans had adjustable rates of interest.\nMunicipal deposits are an important source of funds for us and a reduced level of those deposits may hurt our profits. Securities we may pledge as collateral for our municipal deposits may be subject to risk of loss.\nHistorically, municipal deposits, the source of which was primarily tax revenues from the local casino operations, have been a significant source of funds for our lending and investment activities. At June 30, 2017, $107.2 million, or 23.6% of our total deposits, consisted of municipal deposits. If our municipal deposits decrease to a level where we would need to resort to other sources of funds to support our lending and investment activities, such as borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis, the interest expense associated with these other funding sources may be higher than the rates we pay on the municipal deposits, which would adversely affect our earnings. Since October 2011, the Indiana Board of Depositories required certain institutions holding municipal deposits to pledge up to 100% of the municipal deposits maintained. The requirement to pledge collateral, and the percentage that may be required to be pledged will periodically vary based on a number of financial factors. This collateral is used to insure the municipal deposits of all institutions who receive deposits from Indiana municipalities, and, therefore, is subject to risk of loss if other such institutions fail and there are insufficient Federal Deposit Insurance funds available to cover the liabilities of such institutions. For the years ending June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, no pledge was required.\nWe are dependent upon the services of key executives.\nWe rely heavily on our President and Chief Executive Officer, Elmer G. McLaughlin, and on our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, W. Michael McLaughlin. The loss of either could have a material adverse impact on our operations because, as a small company, we have fewer management-level personnel that have the experience and expertise to readily replace these individuals. Changes in key personnel and their responsibilities may be disruptive to our business and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We have employment agreements with Messrs. Elmer G. and W. Michael McLaughlin.\nStrong competition within our market areas could hurt our profits and slow growth.\nWe face intense competition both in making loans and attracting deposits. Price competition for loans and deposits could result in lower yields on loans and higher costs for deposits, which would reduce net interest income. As of June 30, 2016, the most recent date for which information is available, we held 40.8% of the deposits in Dearborn County and 10.9% of the deposits in Ripley County. Competition also makes it more difficult to hire and retain experienced employees. Some of the institutions with which we compete have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we have and may offer services that we do not provide. We expect competition to increase in the future as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and the continuing trend of consolidation in the financial services industry. Our profitability depends upon our continued ability to compete successfully in our market areas.\nOur asset valuations may include methodologies, estimations and assumptions that are subject to differing interpretations and could result in changes to asset valuations that may materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nWe must use estimates, assumptions, and judgments when financial assets and liabilities are measured and reported at fair value. Assets and liabilities carried at fair value inherently result in a higher degree of financial statement volatility. Fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based on quoted market prices and/or other observable inputs provided by independent third-party sources, when available. When such third-party information is not available, we estimate fair value primarily by using discounted cash flow analysis and other financial modeling techniques utilizing assumptions such as credit quality, liquidity, interest rates and other relevant inputs. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions, or estimates in any of these areas could materially impact our future financial condition and results of operations.\nDuring periods of market disruption, including periods of significantly rising or falling interest rates, rapidly widening credit spreads or illiquidity, it may be difficult to value certain assets and liabilities if trading becomes less frequent and/or market data becomes less observable. There may be certain asset classes that were in active markets with significant observable data that become illiquid due to the new financial environment. In such cases, certain asset valuations may require more subjectivity and management judgment. As such, valuations may include inputs and assumptions that are less observable or require greater estimation. Further, rapidly changing and unprecedented credit and equity market conditions could materially impact the valuation of assets as reported within our consolidated financial statements, and the period-to-period changes in value could vary significantly. Decreases in value may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nNew capital rules generally require insured depository institutions and their holding companies to hold more capital.\nIn July 2013, the Federal Reserve and the OCC adopted a final rule for the Basel III capital framework. These rules substantially amend the regulatory risk-based capital rules applicable to us. The rules phase in over time beginning in 2015 and will become fully effective in 2019. The rules currently apply to the Bank. Beginning in 2015, our minimum capital requirements are (i) a common Tier 1 equity ratio of 4.5%, (ii) a Tier 1 capital (common Tier 1 capital plus Additional Tier 1 capital) of 6% and (iii) a total capital ratio of 8%. Our leverage ratio requirement remains at the 4% level. Beginning in 2016, a capital conservation buffer phases in over three years, ultimately resulting in a requirement of 2.5% on top of the common Tier 1, Tier 1 and total capital requirements, resulting in a required common Tier 1 equity ratio of 7%, a Tier 1 ratio of 8.5%, and a total capital ratio of 10.5%. Failure to satisfy any of these three capital requirements will result in limits on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases and paying discretionary bonuses. These limitations will establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions.\nRegulation of the financial services industry is undergoing major changes, and future legislation could increase our cost of doing business or harm our competitive position.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d) enacted in 2010 has created a significant shift in the way financial institutions operate. The Dodd-Frank Act restructured the regulation of depository institutions by merging the Office of Thrift Supervision, which previously regulated the Bank, into the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and assigning the regulation of savings and loan holding companies, including the Company, to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act also created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau which has broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions including the authority to prohibit \u201cunfair, deceptive or abusive\u201d acts and practices. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than $10.0 billion in assets. Banks and savings institutions with $10.0 billion or less in assets continue to be examined by their applicable bank regulators.\nAs required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the federal banking regulators have adopted new consolidated capital requirements that will limit our ability to borrow at the holding company level and invest the proceeds from such borrowings as capital in the Bank that could be leveraged to support additional growth. The Dodd-Frank Act contains various other provisions designed to enhance the regulation of depository institutions and prevent the recurrence of a financial crisis such as occurred in 2008-2009. The full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on our business and operations will not be known for years until regulations implementing the statute are written and adopted. The Dodd-Frank Act may have a material impact on our operations, particularly through increased regulatory burden and compliance costs.\nAny future legislative changes could have a material impact on our profitability, the value of assets held for investment or collateral for loans. Future legislative changes could require changes to business practices or force us to discontinue businesses and potentially expose us to additional costs, liabilities, enforcement action and reputational risk.\nWe are dependent on our information technology and telecommunications systems and third-party servicers; systems failures, interruptions or breaches of security could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur business is dependent on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and telecommunications systems and third-party servicers. The failure of these systems, or the termination of a third-party software license or service agreement on which any of these systems is based, could interrupt our operations. Because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such services exceeds capacity or such third-party systems fail or experience interruptions. If significant, sustained or repeated, a system failure or service denial could compromise our ability to operate effectively, damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, and/or subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur third-party service providers may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses, phishing schemes and other security breaches. We may be required to expend significant additional resources to protect against the threat of such security breaches and computer viruses, or to alleviate problems caused by such security breaches or viruses. To the extent that the activities of our third-party service providers or the activities of our customers involve the storage and transmission of confidential information, security breaches and viruses could expose us to claims, regulatory scrutiny, litigation and other possible liabilities.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners; and personally identifiable information of our customers and employees. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. We, our customers, and other financial institutions with which we interact, are subject to ongoing, continuous attempts to penetrate key systems by individual hackers, organized criminals, and in some cases, state-sponsored organizations. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such unauthorized access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, and regulatory penalties; disrupt our operations and the services we provide to customers; damage our reputation; and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, all of which could adversely affect our business, revenues and competitive position. We may be required to spend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches and computer viruses, or to alleviate problems caused by security breaches or viruses.\nThe financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes, with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce risk and costs. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations.\nWe face a risk of noncompliance and enforcement action with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations.\nThe federal Bank Secrecy Act, the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (the \u201cPATRIOT Act\u201d) and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain effective anti-money laundering programs and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports as appropriate. The federal Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, established by the U.S. Treasury Department to administer the Bank Secrecy Act, is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and has recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts with the individual federal banking regulators, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration and Internal Revenue Service. Federal and state bank regulators also have begun to focus on compliance with Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering regulations. If our policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient or the policies, procedures and systems of the financial institutions that we may acquire in the future are deficient, we would be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions such as restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of our business plan, including our acquisition plans, which would negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us.\nWe are subject to a variety of operational, environmental, legal and compliance risks, which may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe are exposed to many types of operational risks, including reputational risk, legal and compliance risk, the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders, and unauthorized transactions by employees or operational errors, including clerical or record-keeping errors or those resulting from faulty or disabled computer or telecommunications systems. Negative public opinion can result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including lending practices, corporate governance and acquisitions and from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities. Negative public opinion can adversely affect our ability to attract and keep customers and can expose us to litigation and regulatory action. Actual or alleged conduct by the Bank can also result in negative public opinion about our business.", "PERMNO": 91167, "SIC": 6035, "TIC": "UCBA"}
