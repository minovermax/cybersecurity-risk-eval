{"cik": "1361470", "company": "MAVENIR SYSTEMS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-03", "item_1A": "Item 1A\nRisk Factors\nWe operate in a dynamic and rapidly changing business environment that involves multiple risks and substantial uncertainty. The following discussion addresses risks and uncertainties that could cause, or contribute to causing, actual results to differ from expectations in material ways. In evaluating our business, investors should pay particular attention to the risks and uncertainties described below and in other sections of this report and in our subsequent filings with the SEC. These risks and uncertainties, or other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. The trading price of our common stock could also decline due to any of these risks, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Our Industry\nWe have incurred net losses in the past and may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability in the future.\nWe have incurred significant losses in each year since inception. As a result of ongoing net losses, we had an accumulated deficit of $138.2 million at December 31, 2014. We expect to continue to incur significant product development, sales and marketing, administrative and other expenses. We have only a limited operating history on which you can base your evaluation of our business and our ability to increase our revenue. We commenced operations in 2005 and began product sales in 2007. We will need to generate significant additional revenue to achieve and maintain profitability, and even if we achieve profitability, we cannot be sure that we will remain profitable for any substantial period of time. To the extent we are unable to become or remain profitable, the market price of our common stock will probably decline.\nOur future revenue growth is substantially dependent upon the speed of adoption of 4G LTE technology by mobile service providers.\nWhile we derive, and expect to continue to derive, a substantial portion of our revenue from our messaging solutions, we expect our future revenue growth to be driven largely by sales of our internet protocol (IP)-based voice, video, rich communications and enhanced messaging services, which collectively represent our 4G LTE solutions. IP-based communication services and 4G LTE technology represent new, data-packet-based mobile communications technologies, and their deployment is still in its early stages. Our 4G LTE solutions are dependent upon the use of 4G LTE technology because\nthese solutions are high-bandwidth data applications that require the high-bandwidth access networking provided by 4G LTE technology.\nMobile service providers have delayed implementation of 4G LTE technology for one or a number of reasons, including costs associated with transitioning, costs of handsets, and that their subscribers may not be willing or able to pay for any increased costs of plans that result from the implementation of 4G LTE technology. As a result, if widespread move to 4G LTE technology continues at a slower pace than we expect, our future revenue growth will be materially and adversely affected.\nOur revenue growth will be limited if mobile service providers choose the 4G LTE solutions of our competitors over ours, or if 4G LTE products and solutions do not achieve and sustain high levels of demand and market acceptance.\nOur future revenue growth depends on mobile service providers choosing our 4G LTE solutions over those of our competitors. Additionally, the market for 4G LTE products and solutions is relatively new and still evolving, and it is uncertain whether these products and solutions will achieve and sustain high levels of demand and market acceptance. Even if mobile service providers perceive the benefits of 4G LTE products and solutions, they may not select our 4G LTE solutions for implementation and may instead choose our competitors\u2019 solutions or wait for the introduction of other solutions and technologies that might serve as a replacement or substitute for, or represent an improvement over, our 4G LTE solutions, which would significantly and adversely affect our operating results.\nOur future success depends significantly on our ability to sell our solutions to mobile service providers operating wireless networks that serve large numbers of subscribers.\nOur future success depends significantly on our ability to sell our solutions to mobile service providers operating wireless networks that serve large numbers of subscribers and transport high volumes of traffic. The mobile communications services industry historically has been concentrated among a relatively small number of providers. For example, as of June 2014, the largest twenty mobile service providers in the world, as measured by number of mobile device connections, accounted for approximately 43% of total mobile device connections globally. Because the twenty largest mobile service providers continue to constitute a significant portion of the market for mobile communications equipment, our success depends significantly on our ability to sell solutions to them. Additionally, if we fail to expand our customer base to include additional customers that deploy our solutions in large-scale networks serving significant numbers of subscribers, our revenue growth will be limited.\nOur future software products and maintenance revenue and our revenue growth depend significantly on the success of our efforts to sell additional solutions and maintenance services to our existing mobile service provider customers.\nOur business strategy and our plan to achieve profitability depend significantly on our sales of additional solutions to our existing mobile service provider customers. In addition, our solutions are generally accompanied by right-to-use licenses under which we receive periodic payments based upon the numbers of subscribers to such services from time to time. Therefore, our growth will also depend on our customers\u2019 expanded use of our solutions over greater numbers of subscribers over time. Mobile service providers may choose not to purchase additional solutions from us or may choose not to expand their use of, or not to purchase continued maintenance and support for, our solutions, or might delay additional purchases that we may expect. These events could occur for a number of reasons, including because our mobile service provider customers are not experiencing sufficient subscriber demand for the services that our solutions enable, or because mobile service providers choose solutions other than ours. If we are not successful in selling new and additional solutions to our existing mobile service provider customers or if those customers do not elect to expand their use of our solutions over additional subscribers in their networks, our revenue could grow at a slow rate or decrease and we may not achieve or maintain profitability.\nOur success depends in large part on mobile service providers\u2019 continued deployment of, and investment in, modern telephony equipment and rich communications solutions.\nA significant portion of our product and solution suite is dedicated to enabling mobile service providers to deliver voice and multimedia services over newer and faster IP-based broadband networks. As a result, our success depends significantly on these mobile service providers\u2019 continued deployment of, and investment in, their IP-based networks. Mobile service providers\u2019 deployment of IP-based networks and their migration of communications services from existing circuit-based 2G and 3G networks to IP-based networks is still in its early stages. These mobile service providers\u2019 continued deployment of, and investment in, IP-based networks and rich communications solutions depends on a number of factors outside of our control. These factors include capital constraints, the presence of available capacity on legacy networks, perceived subscriber demand for rich communications solutions, competitive conditions within the telecommunications industry and regulatory issues. If mobile service providers do not continue deploying and investing in their IP-based networks, for these or other reasons, our operating results will be materially and adversely affected.\nMost of our competitors have longer operating histories, greater brand recognition, larger product and customer bases and significantly greater resources (financial, technical, sales, marketing and other) than we do, and we may lack sufficient financial or other resources to maintain or improve our competitive position.\nOur principal competitors include major network infrastructure providers such as Alcatel-Lucent, Ericsson, Huawei, Nokia Siemens Networks, Samsung Electronics and ZTE Corporation as well as specialty solutions providers such as Acision, Acme Packet (recently acquired by Oracle), Broadsoft, Comverse, Metaswitch and Sonus Networks. Our brand is not currently as well-known as those of our larger and more established competitors. In addition, many of our competitors have significantly broader product bases and intellectual property portfolios, as well as significantly greater financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources than we do. They therefore may be better positioned to acquire and offer complementary solutions and technologies. As a result, potential customers may prefer to purchase products or solutions from their existing suppliers or one of our larger competitors. In addition, larger competitors may have more flexibility to agree to financial terms that we are unable to agree to by virtue of our more limited financial resources. We expect increased competition from other established and emerging companies if our market continues to develop and expand. As we enter new markets, we expect to face competition from incumbent and new market participants.\nIn addition, some of our competitors have made acquisitions or entered into partnerships or other strategic relationships with one another to offer a more comprehensive solution than they had offered individually. This consolidation may continue as companies attempt to strengthen or maintain their market positions in an evolving industry and as companies enter into partnerships or are acquired. The competitors resulting from these possible consolidations may develop more compelling product or solution offerings and be able to offer greater pricing flexibility, making it more difficult for us to compete effectively, including on the basis of price, sales and marketing programs, technology, support capacity or product functionality. Industry consolidation may adversely impact perceptions of the viability of smaller and even medium-sized technology companies and, consequently, willingness of mobile service providers to purchase from such companies. These pricing pressures and competition from more comprehensive solutions could impair our ability to sell our solutions, which could negatively affect our revenues and results of operations.\nWe depend on a limited number of mobile service provider customers for a substantial portion of our revenue in any fiscal period, and the loss of, or a significant shortfall in orders from, key customers could significantly reduce our revenue.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our total revenue in any fiscal period from a limited number of mobile service provider customers as a result of the relatively concentrated nature of our target market and the relatively early stage of our development. During any given fiscal period, a small number of customers may account for a significant percentage of our revenue. For example, one of our customers (T-Mobile USA) accounted for approximately 39% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014. Generally, we do not have and we do not enter into multi-year purchase contracts with our customers, nor do we have contractual arrangements to ensure future sales of our solutions to our existing customers. Our inability to generate anticipated revenue from our key existing or targeted customers, or a significant shortfall in sales to them, would significantly reduce our revenue and adversely affect our business. Our operating results in the foreseeable future will continue to depend on our ability to effect sales to existing and other large mobile service provider customers.\nWe have relied significantly on channel partners to sell our solutions in domestic and international markets, and if we are unable to maintain successful relationships with them, our business, operating results, liquidity and financial condition could be harmed.\nWe sell our solutions to mobile service providers both directly and, particularly in international markets, indirectly through channel partners such as telecommunications equipment vendors, value-added resellers and other resellers. We believe that establishing and maintaining successful relationships with these channel partners contributes, and will continue to contribute, to our success, but there can be no guarantee that any such relationships will continue. For example, our contract with Cisco Systems, currently our most significant channel partner in terms of revenue, may be terminated by Cisco with advance notice prior to the end of each automatically renewable one-year term, and we cannot be certain that Cisco will choose not to terminate this contract. Notwithstanding any such decision by Cisco, under our contract with Cisco we would have continuing fulfillment, maintenance and support obligations with respect to any ongoing end-user projects, and we must offer maintenance and support services to Cisco for all of our products already deployed by Cisco at the time of expiration or termination for at least five years from the last commercial sale of our products by Cisco prior to such expiration or termination.\nRecruiting and retaining qualified channel partners and training them in our technology and solutions offerings require significant time and resources. To develop and expand our channels, we must continue to scale and improve our processes and procedures that support our channels, including investment in systems and training. In addition, existing and future channel partners will only partner with us if we are able to provide them with competitive solutions on terms that are acceptable to\nthem. If we fail to maintain the quality of our solutions or to update and enhance them, existing and future channel partners may elect to partner with one or more of our competitors.\nThe reduction in or loss of sales by these channel partners could materially reduce our revenue, either temporarily or permanently. For example, our reseller agreement with Cisco, accounted 19% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014. We cannot assure you that our channel partners will continue to cooperate with us when our reseller agreements expire or are up for renewal. If we fail to maintain successful relationships with our channel partners, fail to develop new relationships with other channel partners in new markets, fail to manage, train or incentivize existing channel partners effectively, fail to provide channel partners with competitive solutions on terms acceptable to them, or if these partners are not successful in their sales efforts, our revenue may decrease and our operating results could suffer.\nOur channel partners may offer their customers the products of several different companies, including those of our competitors. Our channel partners generally do not have an exclusive relationship with us; thus, we cannot be certain that they will prioritize or provide adequate resources for selling our solutions. Divergence in strategy or contract defaults by any of these channel partners may harm our ability to develop, market, sell or support our solutions. Furthermore, some of our competitors may have stronger relationships with our channel partners than we do, and we have limited control, if any, as to whether those partners resell our solutions, rather than our competitors\u2019 products or solutions, or whether they devote resources to market and support our products or solutions rather than those of our competitors. Our failure to establish and maintain successful relationships with channel partners could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, liquidity and financial condition.\nThe long and variable sales and deployment cycles for our solutions may cause our operating results to vary materially from quarter to quarter, which may negatively affect our operating results, and potentially our stock price, for any given quarter.\nOur solutions have lengthy sales cycles, which typically extend from six to eighteen months. A mobile service provider\u2019s decision to purchase our solutions often involves a significant commitment of its resources after an evaluation, qualification and competitive bid process with an unpredictable length. The length of our sales cycles also varies depending on the type of mobile service provider to which we are selling, the solution being sold and the type of network in which our product will be utilized. We may incur substantial sales, marketing and technical expenses and expend significant management effort during this time, regardless of whether we make a sale.\nEven after making the decision to purchase our products, our mobile service provider customers may deploy our products slowly. Timing of deployment can vary widely among mobile service providers. The length of a mobile service provider\u2019s deployment period may directly affect the timing of any subsequent purchase of additional solutions by that mobile service provider. In addition, in some situations we recognize revenue only upon the final acceptance of our solution by a customer, so the timing of purchase and deployment by our customers can significantly affect our operating results for a fiscal period.\nAs a result of the lengthy and uncertain sales and deployment cycles for our solutions, it is difficult for us to predict the quarter in which our mobile service provider customers may purchase additional solutions or features from us or in which we may recognize revenues. Therefore, our operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter, which may negatively affect our operating results, and potentially our stock price, for any given quarter.\nAs a further result of these lengthy sales cycles, we may accept terms or conditions that negatively affect pricing or payment in order to consummate a sale. Doing so can negatively affect our gross margin and results of operations. Alternatively, if mobile service providers ultimately insist upon terms and conditions that we deem too onerous or not to be commercially prudent, we may decline, and thus incur substantial expenses and devote time and resources to potential relationships that never result in completed sales or revenue. If this were to happen often, it would have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nOur large mobile service provider customers have substantial negotiating leverage, which may require that we agree to terms and conditions that could result in increased cost of sales, decreased revenues or delayed recognition of revenues and could adversely affect our operating results.\nMany of our customers are large mobile service providers that have substantial purchasing power and leverage in negotiating contractual arrangements with us, including pricing terms, aggressive timelines, penalties and liquidated damages. Any of our present or future mobile service provider customers may require us to develop additional features, undertake additional testing, and/or may impose penalties, service credits or seek damages relating to product or support performance issues such as delivery, warranty, outages and response times. As we seek to sell more solutions to these mobile service providers, we may be required to agree to more onerous terms and additional performance-based terms and conditions, which may increase cost of sales, affect the timing of revenue recognition or adversely affect our operating results.\nOur quarterly revenue and operating results are unpredictable and may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to factors outside our control, which could adversely affect our business, consolidated financial statements and the trading price of our common stock.\nOur revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control and any of which may cause our stock price to fluctuate. Generally, purchases by mobile service providers of telecommunications solutions from software-based network solutions providers have been unpredictable and clustered, rather than steady, as the various mobile service providers build out their networks according to their own timing, resources and surrounding circumstances. The primary factors that may affect our revenues and operating results include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nfluctuations in demand for our 4G LTE solutions, our messaging solutions or our services, and the timing and size of customer orders;\n\u2022\nlength and variability of the sales cycle for our solutions;\n\u2022\ncompetitive conditions in our markets, including the effects of new entrants, consolidation, technological innovation and substantial price discounting;\n\u2022\nnew solution announcements, introductions and enhancements by us or our competitors, which could result in deferrals of customer orders;\n\u2022\nmarket acceptance of new solutions and solution enhancements that we offer and our services;\n\u2022\nthe mix of solution configurations sold;\n\u2022\nthe quality and degree of execution of our business strategy and operating plan, and the effectiveness of our sales and marketing programs;\n\u2022\nour ability to develop, introduce, ship and successfully deliver new solutions and solution enhancements that meet customer requirements in a timely manner;\n\u2022\nour ability to provide customer support solutions in a timely manner;\n\u2022\nour ability to meet mobile service providers\u2019 solution installation and acceptance deadlines;\n\u2022\nour ability to attain and maintain production volumes and quality levels for our solutions;\n\u2022\ncancellation or deferral of existing customer orders or the renegotiation of existing contractual commitments;\n\u2022\nchanges in our pricing policies, the pricing policies of our competitors and the prices of the components of our solutions;\n\u2022\ntiming of revenue recognition and the application of complex revenue recognition accounting rules to our customer arrangements, including rules requiring that we estimate percentage of completion of a contract, the amount of time required to complete a contract and whether or not we expect to incur a loss on a contract;\n\u2022\nconsolidation within the telecommunications industry, including acquisitions of or by our mobile service provider customers;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions in our markets, both domestic and international, as well as the level and pace of discretionary IT spending by businesses and of service choices by individual consumers;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in foreign exchange rates;\n\u2022\nvariability and unpredictability in the rate of growth in the markets in which we compete;\n\u2022\ncosts related to acquisitions and integration of any acquisitions; and\n\u2022\ncorporate restructurings.\nAs with other software-based network solutions providers, we typically recognize a portion of our revenue in a given quarter from sales booked and shipped in the last weeks of that quarter. As a result, delays in customer orders may result in delays in shipments and recognition of revenue beyond the end of a given quarter. Additionally, as discussed elsewhere in this section, it can be difficult for us to predict the timing of receipt of major customer orders, and we are unable to control timing decisions\nmade by our customers. As a result, our quarterly operating results are difficult to predict even in the near term and a delay in an anticipated sale past the end of a particular quarter may negatively impact our results of operations for that quarter, or in some cases, that year. Therefore, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results are a poor indication of our future performance. If our revenue or operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts or below any guidance we may provide to the market, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. Such a stock price decline could also occur when we have met our publicly stated revenue or operating results guidance.\nA significant portion of our operating expenses is fixed in the short term. If revenues for a particular quarter are below expectations, we would likely be unable to reduce costs and expenses proportionally for that quarter. Any such revenue shortfall would, therefore, have a significant effect on our operating results for that quarter.\nConsolidation in the communications industry can reduce the number of mobile service provider customers and adversely affect our business.\nHistorically, the communications industry has experienced, and it may continue to experience, consolidation and an increased formation of alliances among mobile service providers and between mobile service providers and other entities. Should one of our significant mobile service provider customers consolidate or enter into an alliance with another customer, it is possible that the combined entity could reduce capital expenditures on technology that requires our solutions. It is also possible that such combined entity could decide to either use a different supplier or to renegotiate its supply and service arrangements with us. These consolidations or alliances may cause us to lose customers or require us to reduce prices as a result of enhanced customer leverage, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We may not be able to offset the effects of any price reductions. We may not be able to expand our customer base to make up any revenue declines if we lose customers or business.\nThe quality of our support and services offerings is important to our mobile service provider customers, and if we fail to offer high quality support and services, mobile service providers may not buy our solutions and our revenue may decline.\nOnce our solutions are deployed within our mobile service provider customers\u2019 networks, the customers generally depend on our support organization to resolve issues relating to those solutions. A high level of support is critical for the successful marketing and sale of our solutions. If we are unable to provide the necessary level of support and service to our customers, we could experience:\n\u2022\na loss of customers and market share;\n\u2022\na failure to attract new customers, including in new geographic regions;\n\u2022\nincreased service, support and warranty costs and a diversion of development resources; and\n\u2022\nnetwork performance penalties, including liquidated damages for periods of time that our customers\u2019 networks are inoperable.\nAny of the above results would likely have a material adverse impact on our business, revenue, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and reputation.\nOur business is dependent on our ability to maintain and scale our resources, and any significant disruption in our service and support could damage our reputation, result in a potential loss of customers and adversely affect our financial results.\nOur reputation and ability to attract, retain and serve our mobile service provider customers is dependent upon the reliable performance of our service and support and our underlying technical infrastructure. Our systems may not be adequately designed with the necessary reliability and redundancy to avoid performance delays or outages that could be harmful to our business. If our services and/or support are unavailable when our customers attempt to access them, mobile service providers may not continue to purchase our services and support or our solutions as often in the future, or at all. In addition, customers of ours may seek a refund for solutions purchased under warranty.\nAs our customer base continues to grow, we will need an increasing amount of technical infrastructure, including human resources, to continue to satisfy the needs of our mobile service provider customers. It is possible that we may fail to effectively scale and grow our technical infrastructure to accommodate these increased demands. In addition, our business is subject to interruptions, delays or failures resulting from earthquakes, other natural disasters, terrorism or other catastrophic events.\nWe might require additional capital to support business growth, and this capital might not be available on terms favorable to us or at all.\nWe intend to continue to make investments to support our business growth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges, including the need to develop new solutions or enhance our existing solutions and platform, upgrade our operating infrastructure and acquire complementary businesses and technologies. Accordingly, we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock. Any debt financing obtained by us in the future would likely be senior to our common stock, would likely cause us to incur interest expenses and could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may increase our expenses, make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. We may also be required to secure any such debt obligations with some or all of our assets. In addition, we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. It is also possible that we may allocate significant amounts of capital toward solutions or technologies for which market demand is lower than anticipated and, as a result, abandon such efforts. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, or if we expend capital on projects that are not successful, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited, or we may be required to reduce the scale of our operations. Any of these negative developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, liquidity, financial condition and common stock price.\nIf we lose members of our senior management or development team or are unable to recruit and retain key employees on a cost-effective basis, we may not be able to successfully grow our business.\nOur success is substantially dependent upon the performance of our senior management and other key technical and development personnel. The loss of the services of one or more of these members of our team may significantly delay or prevent our development of successful solutions and the achievement of our business objectives. Our future success will also depend on our ability to attract, retain and motivate skilled personnel in the United States and internationally. Experienced management and technical, sales, marketing and support personnel in the telecom industry are in high demand, and competition for their talents is intense. We may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel on a timely basis, on competitive terms, or at all. The loss of, or the inability to recruit and retain, such employees could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe have experienced rapid growth in recent periods. If we fail to manage our growth effectively and develop and implement appropriate control systems, our business and financial performance may suffer.\nWe have substantially expanded our overall business, number of customers, headcount and operations in recent periods. Our expansion and continued growth has placed, and will continue to place, a significant strain on our managerial, administrative, operational, financial and other resources. Our business model reflects our operation with limited infrastructure, support and administrative headcount, so risks related to managing our growth are particularly salient and we may not have sufficient internal resources to adapt or respond to unexpected challenges. Although we have put certain policies and procedures in place, certain of these policies have recently been adopted or recently changed. We also continue to improve and expand our policies and implement procedures but we have limited staff responsible for their implementation, training and enforcement. If we are unable to manage our growth successfully, or if our control systems do not operate effectively, our ability to provide high quality solutions and services could be harmed, which would damage our reputation and brand, and our business and operating results would suffer.\nUnfavorable general economic conditions in countries where we operate could negatively impact our financial performance.\nUnfavorable general economic conditions, such as a recession or economic slowdown in one or more of the countries in which we operate, could negatively affect consumer demand for our products, the ability of mobile service providers to seek our services and to pay for our services or obtain financing, if needed.\nConsumer purchases of discretionary items tend to decline during recessionary periods or hard economic times when disposable income is lower. Consumers may shift away from high priced phone and data services and opt for lower-priced product offerings such that mobile service providers may be less apt to undertake the purchase of our products and/or delay the purchase or spread the purchase of such product solutions out over time. In addition, the disruption in the credit markets could impact our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers, supplies and creditors in such countries. If\nthe current economic situation deteriorates significantly in the countries in which we operate, our business could be negatively impacted due to consumer preferences, supplier or customer disruptions resulting from tighter credit markets or other economic factors.\nIf we undertake business combinations and acquisitions, they may be difficult to close or integrate, or they could disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value or divert management\u2019s attention.\nWe have completed a few business acquisitions to date. The primary purpose of the acquisitions were to gain access to additional customers, and expand on our infrastructure and our strategic product portfolio while gaining some skilled resources. In the future, we may continue to support our growth through acquisitions of businesses, services or technologies that we perceive to be complementary or otherwise beneficial to us. Current and/or future acquisitions have and may involve risks, such as:\n\u2022\nmisjudgment with respect to the value, return on investment or strategic fit of any acquired operations or assets;\n\u2022\nchallenges associated with integrating acquired technologies, operations, financial reporting systems and cultures of acquired companies;\n\u2022\nexposure to unforeseen liabilities;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management and personnel and other resources from day-to-day operations and longer than expected integration schedules;\n\u2022\npossible loss of key employees, clients, suppliers and partners;\n\u2022\nhigher than expected transaction costs;\n\u2022\npotential loss of commercial relationships and customers based on their concerns regarding the acquired business or technologies; and\n\u2022\nadditional dilution to our existing stockholders if we use our common stock as consideration for such acquisitions.\nAs a result of these risks, we may not be able to achieve the expected benefits of any acquisition. If we are unsuccessful in completing or integrating acquisitions, we may be required to reevaluate our growth strategy and we may incur substantial expenses and devote significant management time and resources in seeking to complete and integrate the acquisitions.\nFuture business combinations could involve the acquisition of significant intangible assets. We may need to record write-downs from future impairments of identified intangible assets and goodwill. These accounting charges would reduce any future reported earnings or increase a reported loss. In addition, we could use substantial portions of our available cash to acquire companies or assets. Subject to the provisions of our existing indebtedness, it is possible that we could incur additional debt or issue additional equity securities as consideration for these acquisitions, which could cause our stockholders to suffer significant dilution.\nWe have and continue to experience material weaknesses and significant deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting and we may experience additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in the future or otherwise fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls in the future, and may not be able to accurately report our financial condition or results of operations, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nAs a result of becoming a public company, we are required, under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting beginning with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014. This assessment includes disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal controls over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal controls over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company\u2019s annual and interim financial statements will not be detected or prevented on a timely basis.\nAny material weakness could result in a misstatement of our accounts or disclosures that would result in a material misstatement of our annual or interim combined financial statements that would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. We cannot assure you that the measures we have taken to date, or any measures we may take in the future, will be sufficient to remediate the material weaknesses described above or avoid potential future material weaknesses.\nWe continue to enhance our computer systems processes and related documentation necessary to perform the evaluation needed to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We may not be able to complete our evaluation, testing and any required remediation in a timely fashion. During the evaluation and testing process, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective. If we are unable to conclude that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which would likely cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nAfter we cease to be an emerging growth company under the federal securities laws, our independent registered public accounting firm will be required to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. Until that time, it is possible that a material weakness in internal controls over financial reporting could remain undetected as a result of our exemption from these auditor attestation requirements under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. If we are unable to confirm that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which would cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nWe have incurred and will continue to incur significant additional costs as a result of being a public company and our management is required to devote significant time and attention to compliance matters.\nWe incur costs associated with corporate governance requirements, including requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules implemented by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the SEC and the national stock exchanges. These rules and regulations have increased our accounting, legal and financial compliance costs, and make some activities more time-consuming and costly. We expect those costs to increase in the future. For example, we are required to devote significant resources to complete the assessment and documentation of our internal control system and financial process under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, including an assessment of the design, implementation and operating effectiveness of our information systems associated with our internal controls over financial reporting. We will continue to incur significant costs to remediate any material weaknesses we identify through these efforts. We also expect these rules and regulations to make it more expensive for us to maintain directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our Board of Directors, our board committees or as executive officers. We cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs.\nNew laws and regulations, as well as changes to existing laws and regulations affecting public companies, including the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and rules adopted by the SEC and the national stock exchanges, would likely result in increased costs to us as we respond to their requirements, which may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nChanges in effective income tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examinations of our tax returns could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nOur future effective tax rates could be subject to volatility or adversely affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nany earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory tax rates;\n\u2022\nchanges in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;\n\u2022\nexpiration of, or lapses in, the research and development tax credit laws;\n\u2022\nexpiration or non-utilization of net operating losses;\n\u2022\nforeign withholding taxes for which no benefit is realizable;\n\u2022\ntax effects of stock-based compensation;\n\u2022\ncosts related to intercompany restructurings;\n\u2022\nchanges in transfer pricing studies; or\n\u2022\nchanges in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof.\nIn addition, in the ordinary course of business we are subject to routine examinations of our income tax returns by federal, state and non-U.S. tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. An unfavorable outcome from one of these examinations may result in additional tax liabilities or other adjustments to our historical results.\nDespite our intentions not to, at some point we may determine that it is advisable from time to time to repatriate earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries under circumstances that could give rise to the imposition of potentially significant withholding taxes by the jurisdictions in which such amounts were earned and substantial tax liabilities in the United States. In addition, we may not receive the benefit of any offsetting tax credits, which also could adversely impact our effective tax rate.\nAlthough we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, our ultimate tax liabilities may materially differ from the tax amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our income tax provision, net income or cash flows in the period or periods for which such determination is made.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of $115.0 million and total foreign net operating loss carryforwards $18.3 million. Under Sections 382 and 383 of Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes, such as research tax credits, to offset its post-change income and taxes may be limited. In general, an \u201cownership change\u201d occurs if there is a cumulative change in our ownership by \u201c5% shareholders\u201d that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. In the event that it is determined that we have in the past experienced an ownership change, or if we experience one or more ownership changes as a result of our initial public offering or future transactions in our stock, then we may be limited in our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax assets to reduce taxes owed on the net taxable income that we earn. Any such limitations on the ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax assets could adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results.\nPublic scrutiny of data privacy issues, worldwide or in particular countries or markets, may result in increased regulation and different industry standards, which could require us to incur significant expenses in order to comply or support compliance with such regulations or deter or prevent us from providing our solutions or services to our mobile service provider customers, thereby harming our business.\nAs part of our business, we supply and support telecommunications equipment as part of mobile service provider networks that collect and store personal information. We expect that collection and storage of personal information to increase, primarily in connection with increased use of mobile data access. The regulatory framework for privacy issues worldwide is currently uncertain and is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future. We or our mobile service provider customers may also face additional privacy issues as we or they expand in international markets, as many nations have privacy protections more stringent than those in the United States. For example, the European Union is in the process of proposing reforms to its existing data protection legal framework, which may result in a greater compliance burden for mobile service providers with subscribers in Europe. Various government and consumer agencies have also called for new regulation and changes in industry practices.\nWe have incurred, and will continue to incur, expenses to comply with privacy and security standards and protocols imposed by law, regulation, industry standards or contractual obligations. Increased domestic or international regulation of data utilization and distribution practices, including self-regulation, could require us to modify our operations and incur significant expense, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our business, including our ability to operate and expand internationally, could be adversely affected if legislation or regulations are adopted, interpreted or implemented in a manner that is inconsistent with our current or planned business practices and that require changes to these practices, the design of our solutions or our customers\u2019 or our privacy policies.\nCompliance with worker health and safety laws and environmental laws could be costly, and noncompliance with these laws could cause us to be subject to material fines and result in substantial additional expenses.\nOur hardware suppliers manufacture the standard servers and other hardware necessary to operate our solutions using substances regulated under various federal, state, local and international laws and regulations governing worker health and safety and the environment. If we and our contract manufacturers do not comply with these laws and regulations, we may suffer a loss of revenues, be unable to sell our solutions in certain markets and/or countries, be subject to penalties and enforced fees and/or suffer a competitive disadvantage. Costs to comply with current laws and regulations and/or similar future laws and regulations, if applicable, could include costs associated with modifying our solutions, recycling and other waste processing costs, legal and regulatory costs and insurance costs. We have recorded and may also be required to record additional expenses\nfor costs associated with compliance with these regulations. We cannot assure you that the costs to comply with these new laws, or with current and future worker health and safety laws and environmental laws will not have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur business is subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation, and could result in claims, changes to our business practices, monetary penalties, increased cost of operations or declines in the growth of our business, or otherwise harm our business.\nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to our business, including privacy, rights of publicity, data protection, content regulation, intellectual property, competition and taxation. Many of these laws and regulations are still evolving and being tested in courts and could be interpreted or applied in ways that could harm our business, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate. In addition, foreign data protection, privacy, consumer protection, content regulation and other laws and regulations are often more restrictive than those in the United States. In particular, the European Union and its member states traditionally have taken broader views as to types of data that are subject to privacy and data protection, and have imposed greater legal obligations on companies in this regard. A number of proposals are pending before federal, state and foreign legislative and regulatory bodies that could significantly disrupt or affect our business. Further, it is difficult to predict how existing laws and regulations will be applied to our business and the new laws and regulations to which we may become subject, and it is possible that they may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our current operating practices. These existing and proposed laws and regulations can be costly to comply with and can delay or impede the development of new products and services, significantly increase our operating costs, require significant time and attention of management and technical personnel and subject us to inquiries or investigations, claims or other remedies, including fines or demands that we modify or cease existing business practices.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property and Our Technology\nInfringement claims are common in our industry and third parties, including competitors, have and could in the future assert infringement claims against us or our customers that we are obligated to indemnify.\nThe communications industry is highly competitive and its technologies are complex. Companies file patent applications and obtain patents covering these technologies frequently and maintain programs to protect their intellectual property portfolios. In addition, patent holding companies regularly bring claims against communications companies. These patent holding companies and some communications companies actively search for, and routinely bring claims against, alleged infringers. For example, we were previously a defendant, along with a number of other communications companies, in a suit brought by a non-operating patent holding company alleging that each of the defendants had infringed upon one of its patents, which suit has been settled with respect to Mavenir.\nOur solutions are technically complex and compete with the products and solutions of significantly larger companies. The likelihood of our being subject to infringement claims may increase as a result of our real or perceived success in selling solutions to mobile service providers, as the number of competitors in our industry grows and as we add functionality to our solutions. We may in the future receive communications from third parties alleging that we may be infringing their intellectual property rights. The visibility we receive from being a public company may result in a greater number of such allegations.\nWe have also agreed, and expect to continue to agree, to indemnify our customers for certain expenses or liabilities resulting from claimed infringement of intellectual property rights of third parties with respect to our solutions and software. As a result, in the case of infringement claims against these customers, we could be required to indemnify them for losses resulting from such claims or to refund license fees they have paid to us. If a customer asserts a claim for indemnification against us, we could incur significant costs and reputational harm disputing it. If we do not succeed in disputing it, we could face substantial liability.\nRegardless of the merit of third-party claims that we or our customers infringe their rights, these claims could:\n\u2022\nbe time-consuming and costly to defend;\n\u2022\ndivert our management\u2019s attention and resources;\n\u2022\nrequire us to redesign our solutions, which may not be feasible or cost-effective;\n\u2022\ncause us to cease producing, licensing or using software or solutions that incorporate challenged intellectual property;\n\u2022\ndamage our reputation and cause customer reluctance to license our solutions; or\n\u2022\nrequire us to pay amounts for past infringement, potentially including treble damages, or enter into royalty or licensing agreements to obtain the right to use a necessary product or component, which may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nIt is possible that other companies hold patents covering technologies similar to one or more of the technologies that we incorporate into our solutions. In addition, new patents may be issued covering these technologies. Unless and until the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issues a patent to an applicant, there is no reliable way to assess the scope of the potential patent. We may face claims of infringement from both holders of issued patents and, depending upon the timing, scope and content of patents that have not yet been issued, patents issued in the future. The application of patent law to the software technologies in the communications industry is particularly uncertain because the time that it takes for a software-related patent to issue is lengthy, which increases the likelihood of pending patent applications claiming inventions that may pre-date development of our own proprietary software. This uncertainty, coupled with litigation or the potential threat of litigation related to our intellectual property, could adversely affect our business, revenue, results of operations, financial condition and reputation.\nOur patent applications may not result in issued patents, which may allow competitors to more easily exploit technology similar to ours.\nOur business depends in part on our ability to maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property for our technologies and solutions and potential solutions in the United States and other countries. We have adopted a strategy of seeking patent protection in the United States and in other countries with respect to certain of the technologies used in or relating to our solutions and processes. As of December 31, 2014, we had a total of 11 patent applications pending in the United States, and 32 pending non-U.S. patent applications, many of which are counterparts to our U.S. patents or patent applications. These patent applications are directed to aspects of our technology and/or to our methods and solutions that support our business. However, the issuance and enforcement of patents involve complex legal and factual questions. Accordingly, we cannot be certain that the patent applications that we file will result in patents being issued, or that our patents and any patents that may be issued to us will cover our technology or the methods or products that support our business, or afford protection against competitors with similar technology. Moreover, the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its validity, scope or enforceability, and competitors or other third parties might successfully challenge the validity, scope or enforceability of any issued patents should we try to enforce them. In addition, patent applications filed in other countries are subject to laws, rules and procedures that differ from those of the United States, and thus we cannot be certain that non-U.S. patent applications will be granted even if corresponding U.S. patents are issued.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, our competitive position could be harmed or we could be required to incur significant expenses to enforce our rights.\nOur success depends to a significant degree upon the protection of our software and other proprietary technology rights, particularly our 4G LTE solutions. In addition to patents, we rely on trade secret, copyright and trademark laws and confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties, all of which offer only limited protection. Our confidentiality agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of our confidential information or provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure. Others may independently discover our trade secrets and proprietary information, in which case we could not assert any trade secret rights against such parties. Furthermore, the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary rights, the reverse engineering of our solutions or other circumvention, invalidation or challenge of our intellectual property.\nAdditionally, patent and other intellectual property protection outside the United States is generally not as comprehensive as in the United States and may not protect our intellectual property in some countries where our solutions are sold or may be sold in the future. Even if patents are granted outside the United States, effective enforcement in those countries may not be available. Many companies have encountered substantial intellectual property infringement in countries where we sell, or intend to sell, our solutions. Consequently, we may be unable to prevent our proprietary technology from being exploited abroad.\nPolicing the unauthorized use of our solutions, trademarks and other proprietary rights is expensive, difficult and, in some cases, impossible. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of management resources, either of which could harm our business. Moreover, such litigation could provoke our opponents to assert counterclaims that we infringe their own intellectual property. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property.\nOur patent applications may not result in issued patents, which may allow competitors to more easily exploit technology similar to ours.\nOur business depends in part on our ability to maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property for our technologies and solutions and potential solutions in the United States and other countries. We have adopted a strategy of seeking patent protection in the United States and in other countries with respect to certain of the technologies used in or relating to our solutions and processes. As of December 31, 2014, we had a total of 11 patent applications pending in the United States, and 32 pending non-U.S. patent applications, many of which are counterparts to our U.S. patents or patent applications. These patent applications are directed to aspects of our technology and/or to our methods and solutions that support our business.

In addition, patent applications filed in other countries are subject to laws, rules and procedures that differ from those of the United States, and thus we cannot be certain that non-U.S. patent applications will be granted even if corresponding U.S. patents are issued.\nIf new industry standards emerge or if we are unable to respond to rapid technological advances in a timely manner, mobile service providers may not buy our solutions and our revenue may decline.\nThe market for telecommunications products and solutions is characterized by rapid technological advances, frequent introductions of new products, evolving industry standards and recurring or unanticipated changes in customer requirements. To succeed, we must effectively anticipate, and adapt in a timely manner to, customer requirements and continue to develop or acquire new solutions and features that meet market demands, technology and architectural trends and new industry standards. This requires us to identify and gain access to or develop new technologies. The introduction of new or enhanced solutions also requires that we carefully manage the transition from older products to minimize disruption in customer ordering practices and ensure that new solutions can be timely delivered to meet demand.\nDeveloping our solutions is expensive, complex and involves uncertainties and requires significant research and development expenditures. We may not have sufficient resources to successfully manage lengthy development cycles. We believe we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to remain competitive. These investments may take several years to generate positive returns or they may never do so. In addition, we may experience design, manufacturing, marketing and other difficulties that could delay or prevent the development, introduction or marketing of new solutions and enhancements. If we fail to meet our development targets, demand for our solutions will decline. Even if we introduce new solutions and enhancements, we may experience a decline in demand for, or revenue from, our existing solutions that is not fully matched by the revenue from new solutions. For example, customers may delay making purchases of a new solution to make a more thorough evaluation of such solution, or until industry reviews become widely available. In addition, we may lose existing customers who choose a competitor\u2019s solution rather than migrate to our new solution. This could result in a temporary or permanent revenue shortfall and harm our business.\nFurthermore, because our solutions are based on complex technology, we can experience unanticipated delays in developing, improving or deploying them. Each phase in the development of our solutions presents serious risks of failure, rework or delay, any one of which could impact the timing and cost effective development of such solution and could jeopardize customer acceptance of the solution. Intensive software testing and validation are critical to the timely introduction of enhancements to several of our solutions and schedule delays sometimes occur in the final validation phase. Unexpected intellectual property disputes, failure of critical design elements and a variety of other execution risks may also delay or even prevent the introduction of these solutions. In addition, the introduction of new solutions by competitors, the emergence of new industry standards or the development of entirely new technologies to replace existing product offerings could render our existing or future solutions obsolete. If our solutions become technologically obsolete, mobile service providers may purchase solutions from our competitors and we may be unable to sell our solutions in the marketplace and generate revenue, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe may not be able to detect errors or defects in our solutions until after full deployment and product liability claims by customers could result in substantial costs.\nOur solutions are sophisticated and are designed to be deployed in large and complex telecommunications networks that require a very high degree of reliability. Because of the nature of our solutions, they can only be fully tested when substantially deployed in very large networks with high volumes of telecommunications traffic. Some of our mobile service provider\ncustomers have only recently begun to commercially deploy our solutions and they may discover errors or defects in the software, or the solutions may not operate as expected. Because we may not be able to detect these problems until full deployment, any errors or defects in our solutions could affect the functionality of the networks in which they are deployed, given the use of our solutions in business-critical applications. As a result, the time it may take us to rectify errors can be critical to our mobile service provider customers. Because of the complexity of our solutions, it may take a material amount of time and resources for us to resolve errors or defects, if we can resolve them at all. The likelihood of such errors or defects is heightened as we acquire new products and solutions from third parties, whether as a result of acquisitions or otherwise.\nBecause our mobile service provider customers\u2019 telecommunications networks into which they deploy our solutions require a very high degree of reliability, the consequences of an adverse effect on their networks, including any type of communications outage, can be very significant and costly. If any network problems were caused, or perceived to be caused, by errors or defects in our solutions, our reputation and the reputation of our solutions could be significantly damaged with respect to that customer and other customers. Such problems could lead to a loss of that customer or other customers.\nIf one of our solutions fails, we could also experience:\n\u2022\npayment of liquidated damages for performance failures;\n\u2022\nloss of, or delay in, revenue recognition;\n\u2022\nincreased service, support, warranty, product replacement and product liability insurance costs, as well as a diversion of development resources; and\n\u2022\ncostly and time-consuming legal actions by our customers, which could result in significant damages awards against us.\nAny of the above events would likely have a material adverse impact on our business, revenue, results of operations, financial condition and reputation.\nWe currently use a limited number of standard hardware suppliers, and in the event any such supplier ceases to supply us timely, qualifying a replacement hardware supplier could require thirty to sixty days, during which time there could be some delay in our scheduled delivery to one or more of our mobile service provider customers, potentially damaging that customer relationship.\nWe currently use a limited number of suppliers for the standard servers and other standard hardware necessary to operate our solutions and to fulfill our customers\u2019 orders on a timely basis. Although we have not experienced any significant supplier delays in the past, purchasing from third-party hardware suppliers exposes us to a limited risk of short-term unavailability of adequate supply because we do not have hardware manufacturing capabilities. In the event any such supplier ceases to supply us timely, qualifying a replacement hardware supplier could require thirty to sixty days, during which time there could be some delay in our scheduled delivery to one or more of our customers, potentially damaging that customer relationship and resulting in payment of liquidated damages or incurrence of service credits which would have a material adverse impact on our business, revenue, results of operations, financial condition and reputation.\nMan-made problems such as computer viruses or terrorism may disrupt our operations and could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nDespite our implementation of network security measures, our servers are vulnerable to computer viruses, break-ins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems. Any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. Efforts to limit the ability of third parties to disrupt the operations of the Internet or undermine our own security efforts may be ineffective. In addition, the continued threat of terrorism and heightened security and military action in response to this threat, or any future acts of terrorism, may cause further disruptions to the economies of the United States and other countries and create further uncertainties or otherwise materially harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. Likewise, events such as widespread electrical blackouts could have similar negative impacts. To the extent that such disruptions or uncertainties result in delays or cancellations of customer orders or the development or shipment of our solutions, our business, operating results, financial condition and reputation could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to obtain necessary licenses of third-party technology on acceptable terms, or at all, which could delay sales and development and adversely impact the quality of our solutions.\nWe have incorporated third-party licensed technology into our current solutions. We anticipate that we are also likely to need to license additional technology from third parties to develop new solutions or enhancements in the future. Third-party licenses may not be available or continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The inability to retain any third-party licenses required in our current solutions or to obtain any new third-party licenses to develop new solutions and enhancements could require us to obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at greater cost, and delay or prevent us from making these solutions or enhancements, any of which could seriously harm the competitive position of our solutions.\nWe use some open source software in developing our solutions, which could in certain circumstances subject us to claims or judgments that some of our proprietary code is subject to general release or could require us to re-engineer our solutions and the firmware contained therein, which could materially harm our business and operating results.\nWe use open source software in developing our solutions, including in connection with our proprietary software, and we may use more open source software in the future. From time to time, there have been claims against companies that use open source software in their products challenging the ownership of such open source software or the terms and conditions upon which those companies make such products available to end users. As a result, we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software or claiming that we have failed to comply with applicable licensing terms. Some open source licenses contain requirements that the licensee make available source code for modifications or derivative works created based upon the open source software and that the licensee license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of a particular open source license or other license granting third parties certain rights of further use. If we combine our proprietary firmware or other software with open source software in a certain manner, we could, under certain of the open source licenses, be required to release our proprietary source code publicly or license such source code on unfavorable terms or at no cost. Although we take steps to protect against our using any open source software that may subject our firmware to general release or require us to re-engineer our solutions and the firmware contained therein, we cannot guarantee that they will be effective, nor that we will not be subject to claims asserting or judgments holding that some of our proprietary source code is subject to general release or that we are required to re-engineer our solutions and firmware. In addition to risks related to license requirements, usage of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on origin of the software. Open source license terms relating to the disclosure of source code in modifications or derivative works to the open source software are often ambiguous, and few if any courts in jurisdictions applicable to us have interpreted such terms. As a result, many of the risks associated with usage of open source software cannot be eliminated, and could, if not properly addressed, negatively affect our business.\nRisks Related to Our International Operations\nWe are exposed to risks related to our international operations and failure to manage these risks may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nWe market, license and service our solutions globally and have a number of offices around the world. During the year ended December 31, 2014, 51% of our revenue was attributable to our customers outside of the United States, respectively. As of December 31, 2014, approximately 80% of our employees were located outside of the United States. We expect that our international activities will be dynamic over the foreseeable future as we continue to pursue opportunities in international markets. Therefore, we are subject to risks associated with having worldwide operations. These international operations will require significant management attention and financial resources.\nInternational operations are subject to inherent risks and our future results could be adversely affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nrequirements or preferences for domestic products or solutions, which could reduce demand for our solutions;\n\u2022\ndiffering technical standards, existing or future regulatory and certification requirements and required features and functionality;\n\u2022\nmanagement communication and integration problems related to entering new markets with different languages, cultures and political systems;\n\u2022\ngreater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in enforcing contracts;\n\u2022\ndifficulties and costs of staffing and managing operations outside of the United States;\n\u2022\nthe uncertainty of protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;\n\u2022\nthe uncertainty and costs of compliance with differing foreign laws and regulations;\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences, including regulatory requirements regarding our ability to repatriate profits to the United States;\n\u2022\ntariffs and trade barriers, export regulations and other regulatory and contractual limitations on our ability to sell our solutions in certain non-U.S. markets;\n\u2022\nenforceability of contractual terms due to differing laws and regulations; and\n\u2022\npolitical and economic instability and terrorism.\nAdditionally, our international operations expose us to risks of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In certain circumstances and depending on the currencies in which certain sales are denominated and the countries in which we are profitable or not profitable, a significant decrease or increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the value of other local currencies could have a material adverse effect on the gross margins and profitability of our international operations. To date, we have not used risk management techniques to hedge the risks associated with these fluctuations. Even if we were to implement hedging strategies, not every exposure can be hedged and, where hedges are put in place based on expected foreign currency exchange exposure, they are based on forecasts that may vary or that may later prove to have been inaccurate. As a result, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates or our failure to successfully hedge against these fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nFailure to comply with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and similar laws associated with our activities outside the United States could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.\nAs a substantial portion of our revenues is, and we expect will continue to be, from jurisdictions outside of the United States, we face significant risks if we fail to comply with the FCPA and other laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payment to governments and their officials and political parties by us and other business entities for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. In many countries, particularly in countries with developing economies, some of which represent significant markets for us, it may be a local custom that businesses operating in such countries engage in business practices that are prohibited by the FCPA or other laws and regulations. Although we have implemented a company policy requiring our employees and consultants to comply with the FCPA and similar laws, such policy may not be effective at preventing all potential FCPA or other violations. We also cannot guarantee the compliance by our channel partners, resellers, suppliers and agents with applicable U.S. laws, including the FCPA, or applicable non-U.S. laws. Therefore there can be no assurance that none of our employees and agents, or those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations, will take actions in violation of our policies or of applicable laws, for which we may be ultimately held responsible. As a result of our focus on managing our growth, our development of infrastructure designed to identify FCPA matters and monitor compliance is at an early stage. Any violation of the FCPA and related policies could result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, which could have a material and adverse effect on our reputation, business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe may become subject to governmental export and import controls that could subject us to liability or impair our ability to compete in international markets.\nOur solutions may become subject to United States export controls under which they would be permitted to be exported outside the United States only with the required level of export license, through an available export license exception or if designated EAR 99 (no license required), if certain of our solutions in the future contain certain levels of encryption technology. In addition, various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute certain of our solutions or could limit our mobile service provider customers\u2019 ability to implement these solutions in those countries. Changes in our solutions or changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction of our solutions in non-U.S. markets, prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our solutions throughout their networks or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of our solutions to certain countries altogether. Any change in export or import laws and regulations, shifts in approach to the enforcement or scope of existing laws and regulations, or change in the countries, persons or technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of our solutions by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell our solutions to, existing or potential customers with international operations. Any decreased use of our solutions or limitation on our ability to export or sell our solutions would likely adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur stock price may be volatile, and you may not be able to resell shares of our common stock at or above the price you paid.\nOur stock price may be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include those discussed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section of this report and others such as:\n\u2022\na slowdown in the telecommunications industry or the general economy;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated quarterly or annual variations in our results of operations or those of our competitors;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated changes in our growth rate relative to our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the values of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of new products or services, significant contracts, commercial relationships, capital commitments or acquisitions;\n\u2022\ncompetition from existing technologies and products or new technologies and products that may emerge;\n\u2022\nthe entry into, modification or termination of customer contracts;\n\u2022\ndevelopments with respect to intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nsales, or the anticipation of sales, of our common stock by us, our insiders or our other stockholders, including upon the expiration of contractual lock-up agreements;\n\u2022\nour ability to develop and market new and enhanced solutions on a timely basis;\n\u2022\nour commencement of, or involvement in, litigation;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key management or technical personnel; and\n\u2022\nchanges in governmental regulations applicable to our solutions.\nIn addition, in recent years, the stock markets generally, and the market for technology stocks in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. Broad market and industry factors may significantly affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. You may not realize any return on your investment in us and may lose some or all of your investment.\nIn addition, in the past, class action litigation has often been instituted against companies whose securities have experienced periods of volatility in market price. Securities litigation brought against us following volatility in our stock price, regardless of the merit or ultimate results of such litigation, could result in substantial costs, which would hurt our financial condition and operating results and divert management\u2019s attention and resources from our business.\nSecurities analysts may not publish favorable research or reports about our business or may publish no information at all, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced to some extent by the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us and our business. We do not control these analysts. As a newly public company, we may be slow to attract research coverage and the analysts who publish information about our common stock will have had relatively little experience with our company, which could affect their ability to accurately forecast our results and could make it more likely that we fail to meet their estimates. In the event we obtain securities or industry analyst coverage, if any of the analysts who cover us provide inaccurate or unfavorable research or issue an adverse opinion regarding our stock price, our stock price could decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports covering us, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nThe concentration of our capital stock ownership with insiders will likely limit your ability to influence corporate matters.\nOur executive officers, directors, current five percent or greater stockholders and affiliated entities together owned approximately 61% of our common stock at December 31, 2014. These stockholders may in some instances exercise their influence in ways that you do not believe are in your best interests as a stockholder. In particular, these stockholders, acting together, may be able to control our management and affairs and matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, such as mergers, consolidations or the sale of substantially all of our assets. Consequently, this concentration of ownership could limit your ability to influence corporate matters and may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control, including a merger, consolidation or other business combination involving us, or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control, even if such a change of control would benefit our other stockholders. This significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price for our common stock because some investors perceive disadvantages in owning stock in companies with concentrated equity ownership.\nWe are an emerging growth company and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions and relief from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. In particular, while we are an emerging growth company (i) we will not be required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (ii) we will be exempt from any rules that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board requiring mandatory audit firm rotations or a supplement to the auditor\u2019s report on financial statements, (iii) we will be subject to reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and (iv) we will not be required to hold nonbinding advisory votes on executive compensation or stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We may remain an emerging growth company until as late as December 31, 2018 (the fiscal year-end following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our November 2013 initial public offering), though we may cease to be an emerging growth company earlier under certain circumstances, including (i) if the market value of our common stock that is held by nonaffiliates exceeds $700 million as of any June 30, in which case we would cease to be an emerging growth company as of the following December 31, (ii) if our gross revenues exceed $1 billion in any fiscal year, or (iii) if we issue, during any three-year period, more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt.\nThe exact implications of the JOBS Act are still subject to interpretation and guidance by the SEC and other regulatory agencies, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to take advantage of all of the benefits of the JOBS Act. In addition, investors may find our common stock less attractive if we rely on the exemptions and relief granted by the JOBS Act. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock, our stock price may decline and/or become more volatile and we may face difficulties raising capital from the public equity markets in the future.\nA significant portion of our total outstanding shares of common stock may be sold into the market in the near future. This could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is operating successfully.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. These sales, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares of common stock intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock. At December 31, 2014, entities affiliated with North Bridge Venture Partners, entities affiliated with Austin Ventures, entities affiliated with Alloy Ventures, entities affiliated with Wellington Capital Management LLP, entities affiliated with August Capital and Goldman Sachs Asset Management owned, collectively, approximately 61% of our outstanding common stock. If one or more of them were to sell a substantial portion of the shares they hold, it could cause our stock price to decline.\nHolders of an aggregate of approximately 14 million shares of our common stock currently have rights, subject to some conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering their shares or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders.\nIn addition, shares issued or issuable in connection with equity awards granted under our equity incentive plans as well as shares we may issue under our employee stock purchase plan will become eligible for sale in the public market to the extent permitted by any applicable vesting requirements, the lock-up agreements described above and Rules 144 and 701 under the Securities Act of 1933.\nWe do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future, and accordingly, stockholders must rely on stock appreciation for any return on their investment.\nWe do not currently anticipate declaring any cash dividends to holders of our common stock in the foreseeable future. In addition, the terms of our loan and security agreement with Silicon Valley Bank currently restrict our ability to pay dividends. Consequently, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment. Investors seeking cash dividends should not invest in our common stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company. These provisions could also make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nproviding for a classified Board of Directors with staggered, three-year terms;\n\u2022\nprohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n\u2022\nproviding that our directors may be removed only for cause;\n\u2022\nauthorizing the Board of Directors to issue, without stockholder approval, preferred stock with rights senior to those of our common stock;\n\u2022\nauthorizing the Board of Directors to change the authorized number of directors and to fill board vacancies until the next annual meeting of the stockholders;\n\u2022\nrequiring the approval of our Board of Directors or the holders of a supermajority of our outstanding shares of capital stock to amend our bylaws and certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation;\n\u2022\nrequiring stockholders that seek to present proposals before, or to nominate candidates for election of directors at, a meeting of stockholders to provide advance written notice of such proposals or nominations;\n\u2022\nprohibiting stockholder action by written consent;\n\u2022\nlimiting the liability of, and providing indemnification to, our directors and officers;\n\u2022\nprohibiting our stockholders from calling a special stockholder meeting;\n\u2022\nrequiring an advance notification procedure for stockholder nominations and proposals; and\n\u2022\nproviding that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for any derivative action, actions asserting a breach of fiduciary duty and certain other actions against us or any directors or executive officers.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which, subject to some exceptions, prohibits \u201cbusiness combinations\u201d between a Delaware corporation and an \u201cinterested stockholder,\u201d which is generally defined as a stockholder who becomes a beneficial owner of 15% or more of a Delaware corporation\u2019s voting stock, for a three-year period following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder.\nThese and other provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws and under Delaware law could discourage potential takeover attempts, reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock and result in the market price of our common stock being lower than it would be without these provisions.", "PERMNO": 14290, "SIC": 3576, "TIC": "MVNR"}
