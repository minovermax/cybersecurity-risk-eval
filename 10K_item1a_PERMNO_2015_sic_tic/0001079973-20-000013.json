{"cik": "1031093", "company": "SILVER BULL RESOURCES, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-01-13", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nA purchase of our securities involves a high degree of risk. Our business or operating or financial condition could be harmed due to any of the following risks. Accordingly, investors should carefully consider these risks in making a decision as to whether to purchase, sell or hold our securities. In addition, investors should note that the risks described below are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks not presently known to us, or risks that do not seem significant today, may impair our business operations in the future. You should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the documents incorporated by reference herein, before making a decision to invest in our securities.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS:\nIf South32 exercises its option to purchase 70% of the equity of Minera Metalin and Contratistas, we will no longer control the development of the Sierra Mojada Project.\nOn June 1, 2018, we entered into the Option Agreement with South32, a wholly owned subsidiary of South32 Limited (ASX/JSE/LSE: S32), whereby South32 is able to obtain the Option to purchase 70% of the equity of Minera Metalin and Contratistas, and oversee the mineral exploration of the Sierra Mojada Project. If South32 exercises the Option, then we will no longer control the development of the Sierra Mojada Project. South32 would have the ability to control the timing and pace of future development, and its decisions may not be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders.\nIf South32 were to exercise its option to purchase 70% of the equity of Minera Metalin and Contratistas, we will be required to contribute 30% of subsequent funding toward development of the Sierra Mojada Project, and we do not currently have sufficient funds to do so.\nIf South32 exercises its option to purchase 70% of the equity of Minera Metalin and Contratistas, under the terms of the Option Agreement, we will retain a 30% ownership in Minera Metalin and Contratistas, and be obligated to contribute 30% of subsequent funding toward the development of the Sierra Mojada Project. If we fail to satisfy our funding commitment, our interest in Minera Metalin and Contratistas will be diluted. We do not currently have sufficient funds with which to satisfy this future funding commitment, and there is no certainty that we will be able to obtain sufficient future funds on acceptable terms or at all.\nWe may have difficulty meeting our current and future capital requirements.\nOur management and our board of directors monitor our overall costs and expenses and, if necessary, adjust our programs and planned expenditures in an attempt to ensure that we have sufficient operating capital. We continue to evaluate our costs and planned expenditures for our ongoing exploration efforts at our Sierra Mojada Project. As of October 31, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of $1,432,000. Even with the South32 funds, the continued exploration and possible development of the Sierra Mojada Project will require significant amounts of additional capital. If we are unable to fund future operations by way of financings, including public or private offerings of equity or debt securities, we will need to significantly reduce operations, which will result in an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and exploration activities. We do not have a credit, off-take or other commercial financing arrangement in place that would finance continued evaluation or development of the Sierra Mojada Project, and we believe that securing credit for these projects may be difficult. Moreover, equity financing may not be available on attractive terms and, if available, will likely result in significant dilution to existing stockholders.\nWe are an exploration stage mining company with no history of operations.\nWe are an exploration stage enterprise engaged in mineral exploration in Mexico. We have a very limited operating history and are subject to all the risks inherent in a new business enterprise. As an exploration stage company, we may never enter the development and production stages. To date, we have had no revenues and have relied upon equity financing and South32 funding to fund our operations. The likelihood of our success must be considered in light of the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications, and delays frequently encountered in connection with an exploration stage business, and the competitive and regulatory environment in which we operate and will operate, such as under-capitalization, personnel limitations, and limited financing sources.\nWe have no commercially mineable ore body.\nNo commercially mineable ore body has been delineated on our Sierra Mojada Project, nor have our properties been shown to contain proven or probable mineral reserves. Investors should not assume that the projections contained in the Report on our Sierra Mojada Project will ever be realized. We cannot assure you that any mineral deposits we identify on the Sierra Mojada Project or on another property will qualify as an ore body that can be legally and economically exploited or that any particular level of recovery of silver, zinc or other minerals from discovered mineralization will in fact be realized. Most exploration projects do not result in the discovery of commercially mineable ore deposits. Even if the presence of reserves is established at a project, the legal and economic viability of the project may not justify exploitation.\nMineral resource estimates may not be reliable.\nThere are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of mineralized material such as silver, zinc, lead, and copper, including many factors beyond our control, and no assurance can be given that the recovery of mineralized material will be realized. In general, estimates of mineralized material are based upon a number of factors and assumptions made as of the date on which the estimates were determined, including:\ngeological and engineering estimates that have inherent uncertainties;\nthe assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies;\nthe judgment of the engineers preparing the estimate;\nestimates of future metals prices and operating costs;\nthe quality and quantity of available data;\nthe interpretation of that data; and\nthe accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions, all of which may vary considerably from actual results.\nAll estimates are, to some degree, uncertain. For these reasons, estimates of the recoverable mineral resources prepared by different engineers or by the same engineers at different times may vary substantially. As such, there is significant uncertainty in any mineralized material estimate, and actual deposits encountered and the economic viability of a deposit may differ materially from our estimates.\nOur business plan is highly speculative, and its success largely depends on the successful exploration of our Sierra Mojada concessions.\nOur business plan is focused on exploring the Sierra Mojada concessions to identify reserves and, if appropriate, to ultimately develop this property. Although we have reported mineralized material on our Sierra Mojada Project, we have not established any reserves and remain in the exploration stage. We may never enter the development or production stage. Exploration of mineralization and determination of whether the mineralization might be extracted profitably is highly speculative, and it may take a number of years until production is possible, during which time the economic viability of the project may change. Substantial expenditures are required to establish reserves, extract metals from ore and construct mining and processing facilities.\nThe Sierra Mojada Project is subject to all of the risks inherent in mineral exploration and development. The economic feasibility of any mineral exploration and/or development project is based upon, among other things, estimates of the size and grade of mineral reserves, proximity to infrastructures and other resources (such as water and power), anticipated production rates, capital and operating costs, and metals prices. To advance from an exploration project to a development project, we will need to overcome various hurdles, including completing favorable feasibility studies, securing necessary permits, and raising significant additional capital to fund activities. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in overcoming these hurdles. Because of our focus on the Sierra Mojada Project, the success of our operations and our profitability may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of adverse conditions unique to the Torreon, Mexico region, as the Sierra Mojada Project is located 250 kilometers north of this area.\nDue to our history of operating losses, we are uncertain that we will be able to maintain sufficient cash to accomplish our business objectives.\nDuring the fiscal years ended October 31, 2019 and October 31, 2018, we suffered net losses of $3,939,000 and $3,520,000 respectively. At October 31, 2019, we had stockholders\u2019 equity of $8,565,000 and cash and cash equivalents of $1,432,000. Significant amounts of capital will be required to continue to explore and potentially develop the Sierra Mojada concessions. We are not engaged in any revenue producing activities, and we do not expect to be in the near future. Currently, our potential sources of funding consist of the sale of additional equity securities, entering into joint venture agreements or selling a portion of our interests in our assets. There is no assurance that any additional capital that we will require will be obtainable on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Failure to obtain such additional financing could result in delays or indefinite postponement of further exploration of our projects. Additional financing, if available, will likely result in substantial dilution to existing stockholders.\nOur exploration activities require significant amounts of capital that may not be recovered.\nMineral exploration activities are subject to many risks, including the risk that no commercially productive or extractable resources will be encountered. There can be no assurance that our activities will ultimately lead to an economically feasible project or that we will recover all or any portion of our investment. Mineral exploration often involves unprofitable efforts, including drilling operations that ultimately do not further our exploration efforts. The cost of minerals exploration is often uncertain, and cost overruns are common. Our drilling and exploration operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including title problems, weather conditions, protests, compliance with governmental requirements, including permitting issues, and shortages or delays in the delivery of equipment and services.\nOur financial condition could be adversely affected by changes in currency exchange rates, especially between the U.S. dollar and the Mexican peso (\u201c$MXN\u201d) and the U.S dollar and the Canadian dollar (\u201c$CDN\u201d) given our focus on the Sierra Mojada Project in Mexico and our corporate office in Vancouver, Canada.\nOur financial condition is affected in part by currency exchange rates, as portions of our exploration costs in Mexico and general and administration costs in Canada are denominated in the local currency. A weakening U.S. dollar relative to the $MXN and $CDN will have the effect of increasing exploration costs and general and administration costs while a strengthening U.S. dollar will have the effect of reducing exploration costs and general and administration costs. The exchange rates between the $CDN and the U.S. dollar and between the $MXN and U.S. dollar have fluctuated widely in response to international political conditions, general economic conditions and other factors beyond our control.\nOur success depends on developing and maintaining relationships with local communities and other stakeholders.\nOur ongoing and future success depends on developing and maintaining productive relationships with the communities surrounding our operations and other stakeholders in our operating locations. We believe that our operations can provide valuable benefits to surrounding communities, in terms of direct employment, training and skills development. In addition, we seek to maintain our partnerships and relationships with local communities and stakeholders in a variety of ways, including in-kind contributions, sponsorships and donations. Notwithstanding our ongoing efforts, local communities and stakeholders can become dissatisfied with our activities or the level of benefits provided, which may result in legal or administrative proceedings, civil unrest, protests, direct action or campaigns against us, such as the recent blockade by Mineros Norte\u00f1os that caused us to halt all work on the Sierra Mojada Property. Any such occurrences, including the blockade, could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRISKS RELATING TO THE MINERAL EXPLORATION INDUSTRY:\nThere are inherent risks in the mineral exploration industry.\nWe are subject to all of the risks inherent in the minerals exploration industry, including, without limitation, the following:\nwe are subject to competition from a large number of companies, many of which are significantly larger than we are, in the acquisition, exploration, and development of mining properties;\nwe might not be able raise enough money to pay the fees and taxes and perform the labor necessary to maintain our concessions in good status;\nexploration for minerals is highly speculative, involves substantial risks and is frequently unproductive, even when conducted on properties known to contain significant quantities of mineralization, and our exploration projects may not result in the discovery of commercially mineable deposits of ore;\nthe probability of an individual prospect ever having reserves that meet the requirements for reporting under SEC Industry Guide 7 is remote, and any funds spent on exploration may be lost;\nour operations are subject to a variety of existing laws and regulations relating to exploration and development, permitting procedures, safety precautions, property reclamation, employee health and safety, air quality standards, pollution and other environmental protection controls, and we may not be able to comply with these regulations and controls; and\na large number of factors beyond our control, including fluctuations in metal prices, inflation, and other economic conditions, will affect the economic feasibility of mining.\nMetals prices are subject to extreme fluctuation.\nOur activities are influenced by the prices of commodities, including silver, zinc, lead, copper and other metals. These prices fluctuate widely and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control, including interest rates, expectations for inflation, speculation, currency values (in particular, the strength of the U.S. dollar), global and regional demand, political and economic conditions and production costs in major metal-producing regions of the world.\nOur ability to establish reserves through our exploration activities, our future profitability and our long-term viability depend, in large part, on the market prices of silver, zinc, lead, copper and other metals. The market prices for these metals are volatile and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control, including:\nglobal or regional consumption patterns;\nsupply of, and demand for, silver, zinc, lead, copper and other metals;\nspeculative activities and producer hedging activities;\nexpectations for inflation;\npolitical and economic conditions; and\nsupply of, and demand for, consumables required for production.\nFuture weakness in the global economy could increase volatility in metals prices or depress metals prices, which could in turn reduce the value of our properties, make it more difficult to raise additional capital, and make it uneconomical for us to continue our exploration activities.\nThere are inherent risks with foreign operations.\nOur business activities are primarily conducted in Mexico, and as such, our activities are exposed to various levels of foreign political, economic and other risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, terrorism, hostage taking, military repression, extreme fluctuations in currency exchange rates, high rates of inflation, labor unrest, war or civil unrest, expropriation and nationalization, renegotiation or nullification of existing concessions, licenses, permits, approvals and contracts, illegal mining, changes in taxation policies, restrictions on foreign exchange and repatriation, changing political conditions (including, potential instability if the United States withdraws from or as a result of renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement), currency controls and governmental regulations that favor or require the rewarding of contracts to local contractors or require foreign contractors to employ citizens of, or purchase supplies from, a particular jurisdiction.\nChanges, if any, in mining or investment policies or shifts in political attitude in Mexico may adversely affect our exploration and possible future development activities. We may also be affected to varying degrees by government regulations with respect to, but not limited to, foreign investment, maintenance of claims, environmental legislation, land use, land claims of local people, water use and mine safety. Failure to comply strictly with applicable laws, regulations and local practices relating to mineral right applications and tenure could result in loss, reduction or expropriation of entitlements, or the imposition of additional local or foreign parties as joint venture partners with carried or other interests.\nThe occurrence of these various factors and uncertainties cannot be accurately predicted and could have an adverse effect on our operations. In addition, legislation in the United States, Canada or Mexico regulating foreign trade, investment and taxation could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nOur Sierra Mojada Project is located in Mexico and is subject to varying levels of political, economic, legal and other risks.\nThe Sierra Mojada Project, our primary focus, is in Mexico. In the past, Mexico has been subject to political instability, changes and uncertainties that have resulted in changes to existing governmental regulations affecting mineral exploration and mining activities. Mexico\u2019s status as a developing country may make it more difficult for us to obtain any required financing for the Sierra Mojada Project or other projects in Mexico in the future. Our Sierra Mojada Project is also subject to a variety of governmental regulations governing health and worker safety, employment standards, waste disposal, protection of historic and archaeological sites, mine development, protection of endangered and protected species and other matters. Mexican regulators have broad authority to shut down and/or levy fines against facilities that do not comply with regulations or standards.\nOur exploration activities in Mexico may be adversely affected to varying degrees by changing government regulations relating to the mining industry or shifts in political conditions that increase the costs related to the Sierra Mojada Project. Changes, if any, in mining or investment policies or shifts in political attitude may adversely affect our financial condition. Expansion of our activities will be subject to the need to obtain sufficient access to adequate supplies of water and assure the availability of sufficient power and surface rights that could be affected by government policy and competing operations in the area.\nWe also have litigation risk with respect to our operations. See Part I, Item 3 - Legal Proceedings of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for an explanation of material legal proceedings to which Silver Bull or its subsidiaries have been a party.\nThe occurrence of these various factors and uncertainties cannot be accurately predicted and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition. Future changes in applicable laws and regulations or changes in their enforcement or regulatory interpretation could negatively impact current or planned exploration activities with the Sierra Mojada Project or in respect to any other projects in which we become involved in Mexico. Any failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, even if inadvertent, could result in the interruption of exploration operations or material fines, penalties or other liabilities.\nTitle to our properties may be challenged or defective.\nOur future operations, including our activities at the Sierra Mojada Project and other exploration activities, will require additional permits from various governmental authorities. Our operations are and will continue to be governed by laws and regulations governing prospecting, mineral exploration, exports, taxes, labor standards, occupational health, waste disposal, toxic substances, land use, environmental protection, mine safety, mining royalties and other matters. There can be no assurance that we will be able to acquire all required licenses, permits or property rights on reasonable terms or in a timely manner, or at all, that such terms will not be adversely changed, that required extensions will be granted, or that the issuance of such licenses, permits or property rights will not be challenged by third parties.\nWe attempt to confirm the validity of our rights of title to, or contract rights with respect to, each mineral property in which we have a material interest. However, we cannot guarantee that title to our properties will not be challenged. The Sierra Mojada Property may be subject to prior unregistered agreements, interests or native land claims, and title may be affected by undetected defects. There may be valid challenges to the title of any of the claims comprising the Sierra Mojada Property that, if successful, could impair possible development and/or operations with respect to such properties in the future. Challenges to permits or property rights (whether successful or unsuccessful), changes to the terms of permits or property rights, or a failure to comply with the terms of any permits or property rights that have been obtained could have a material adverse effect on our business by delaying or preventing or making continued operations economically unfeasible.\nA title defect could result in Silver Bull losing all or a portion of its right, title, and interest to and in the properties to which the title defect relates. Title insurance generally is not available, and our ability to ensure that we have obtained secure title to individual mineral properties or mining concessions may be severely constrained. In addition, we may be unable to operate our properties as permitted or to enforce our rights with respect to our properties. We annually monitor the official mining records in Mexico City to determine if there are annotations indicating the existence of a legal challenge against the validity of any of our concessions. As of January 2019, and to the best of our knowledge, there are no such annotations, nor are we aware of any challenges from the government or from third parties, except for the Mineros Norte\u00f1os matter described in Part I, Item 3 - Legal Proceedings.\nIn addition, in connection with the purchase of certain mining concessions, Silver Bull agreed to pay a net royalty interest on revenue from future mineral sales on certain concessions at the Sierra Mojada Project, including concessions on which a significant portion of our mineralized material is located. The aggregate amount payable under this royalty is capped at $6.875 million (the \u201cRoyalty\u201d), an amount that will only be reached if there is significant future production from the concessions. As noted in Part I, Item 3 (Legal Proceedings), this Royalty is currently the subject of a dispute with a local cooperative. In addition, records from prior management indicate that additional royalty interests may have been created, although the continued applicability and scope of these interests are uncertain. The existence of these royalty interests may have a material effect on the economic feasibility of potential future development of the Sierra Mojada Project.\nWe are subject to complex environmental and other regulatory risks, which could expose us to significant liability and delay and potentially the suspension or termination of our exploration efforts.\nOur mineral exploration activities are subject to federal, state and local environmental regulations in the jurisdictions where our mineral properties are located. These regulations mandate, among other things, the maintenance of air and water quality standards and land reclamation. They also set forth limitations on the generation, transportation, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous waste. No assurance can be given that environmental standards imposed by these governments will not be changed, thereby possibly materially adversely affecting our proposed activities. Compliance with these environmental requirements may also necessitate significant capital outlays or may materially affect our earning power.\nEnvironmental legislation is evolving in a manner that will require stricter standards and enforcement, increased fines and penalties for non-compliance, more stringent environmental assessments of proposed projects, and a heightened degree of responsibility for companies and their officers, directors and employees. As a result of recent changes in environmental laws in Mexico, for example, more legal actions supported or sponsored by non-governmental groups interested in halting projects may be filed against companies operating in all industrial sectors, including the mining sector. Mexican projects are also subject to the environmental agreements entered into by Mexico, the United States and Canada in connection with the North American Free Trade Agreement or any renegotiated agreement between these parties.\nFuture changes in environmental regulations in the jurisdictions where our projects are located may adversely affect our exploration activities, make them prohibitively expensive, or prohibit them altogether. Environmental hazards may exist on the properties in which we currently hold interests, such as the Sierra Mojada Project, or may hold interests in the future, that are unknown to us at present and that have been caused by us or previous owners or operators, or that may have occurred naturally. We may be liable for remediating any damage that we may have caused. The liability could include costs for removing or remediating the release and damage to natural resources, including ground water, as well as the payment of fines and penalties.\nOur industry is highly competitive, attractive mineral properties and property concessions are scarce, and we may not be able to obtain quality properties or concessions.\nWe compete with other mining and exploration companies in the acquisition of mineral properties and property concessions. There is competition for a limited number of attractive mineral property acquisition opportunities, some of which is with other companies having substantially greater financial resources, staff and facilities than we do. As a result, we may have difficulty acquiring quality mineral properties or property concessions.\nWe may face a shortage of water.\nWater is essential in all phases of the exploration and development of mineral properties. It is used in such processes as exploration, drilling, leaching, placer mining, dredging, testing, and hydraulic mining. Both the lack of available water and the cost of acquisition may make an otherwise viable project economically impossible to complete. In November 2013, Silver Bull was granted the right to exploit up to 3.5 million cubic meters of water per year from six different well sites by the water regulatory body in Mexico, La Comisi\u00f3n Nacional del Agua, but it has yet to be determined if the six well sites can produce this much water over a sustained period of time.\nOur non-operating properties are subject to various hazards.\nWe are subject to risks and hazards, including environmental hazards, possible encounters with unusual or unexpected geological formations, cave-ins, flooding and earthquakes, and periodic interruptions due to inclement or hazardous weather conditions. These occurrences could result in damage to, or the destruction of, mineral properties or future production facilities, personal injury or death, environmental damage, delays in our exploration activities, asset write-downs, monetary losses and possible legal liability. We may not be insured against all losses or liabilities, either because such insurance is unavailable or because we have elected not to purchase such insurance due to high premium costs or other reasons. Although we maintain insurance in an amount that we consider to be adequate, liabilities might exceed policy limits, in which event we could incur significant costs that could adversely affect our activities. The realization of any significant liabilities in connection with our activities as described above could negatively affect our activities and the price of our common stock.\nWe need and rely upon key personnel.\nPresently, we employ a limited number of full-time employees, utilize outside consultants, and in large part rely on the efforts of our officers and directors. Our success will depend, in part, upon the ability to attract and retain qualified employees. In particular, we have only three executive officers, Brian Edgar, Timothy Barry and Sean Fallis, and the loss of the services of any of these three would adversely affect our business.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR COMMON STOCK:\nFurther equity financings may lead to the dilution of our common stock.\nIn order to finance future operations, we may raise funds through the issuance of common stock or the issuance of debt instruments or other securities convertible into common stock. We cannot predict the size of future issuances of common stock or the size and terms of future issuances of debt instruments or other securities convertible into common stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of our securities will have on the market price of our common stock. Any transaction involving the issuance of previously authorized but unissued shares, or securities convertible into common stock, would result in dilution, possibly substantial, to present and prospective security holders. Demand for equity securities in the mining industry has been weak; therefore, equity financing may not be available on attractive terms and, if available, will likely result in significant dilution to existing shareholders.\nNo dividends are anticipated.\nAt the present time, we do not anticipate paying dividends, cash or otherwise, on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Future dividends will depend on our earnings, if any, our financial requirements and other factors. There can be no assurance that we will pay dividends.\nOur stock price can be very volatile.\nOur common stock is listed on the TSX and trades on the OTCQB. The trading price of our common stock has been, and could continue to be, subject to wide fluctuations in response to announcements of our business developments, results and progress of our exploration activities at the Sierra Mojada Project, progress reports on our exploration activities, and other events or factors. In addition, stock markets have experienced significant price volatility in recent months and years. This volatility has had a substantial effect on the share prices of companies, at times for reasons unrelated to their operating performance. These fluctuations could be in response to:\nvolatility in metal prices;\npolitical developments in the foreign countries in which our properties are located; and\nnews reports relating to trends in our industry or general economic conditions.\nThese broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance.\nWe cannot make any predictions or projections as to what the prevailing market price for our common stock will be at any time, including as to whether our common stock will achieve or remain at levels at or near its offering price, or as to what effect the sale of shares or the availability of common stock for sale at any time will have on the prevailing market price.", "PERMNO": 91581, "SIC": 1000, "TIC": "SVBL"}
