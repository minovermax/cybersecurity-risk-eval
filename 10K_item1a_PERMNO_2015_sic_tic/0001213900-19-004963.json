{"cik": "1402479", "company": "MYOS RENS TECHNOLOGY INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nInvesting in our securities involves a high degree of risk. Before deciding whether to invest in our securities, you should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below, and other information contained in this Report including our financial statements and the related notes thereto. The risks and uncertainties set forth below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also adversely affect us. If any of the described risks occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially harmed. In such case, the value of our securities could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment. Amounts in this section are in thousands, unless otherwise indicated.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS\nOur limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and results of operations.\nWe are an early stage company and have a limited operating history. Our future prospects should be considered in light of the risks and uncertainties experienced by early stage companies in evolving markets such as the market for our current and future products, if any, in the United States. We will continue to encounter risks and difficulties that companies at a similar stage of development frequently experience, including the potential failure to:\n\u25cf build a strong and compelling consumer brand and;\n\u25cf increase awareness and develop customer loyalty;\n\u25cf adequately protect and build our intellectual property;\n\u25cf develop new products while maintaining effective control of our costs and expenses;\n\u25cf conduct successful research and development activities;\n\u25cf respond to requirements and changes in our regulatory environment;\n\u25cf respond to competitive market conditions;\n\u25cf availability of sufficient capital resources to adequately promote and market our products; and\n\u25cf attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.\nIf we are unable to address any or all of these risks, our business may be materially and adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to successfully market and promote our own core branded products, we will not be able to increase our sales and our business and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nIn 2018, we launched Yolked\u00ae and Myos Canine Muscle Formula\u00ae \u00ae as our proprietary branded products, using multiple delivery formats. Successfully marketing and promoting products is a complex and uncertain process, dependent on the efforts of our management, sales force and outside consultants and general economic conditions, among other things. There is no assurance that we will successfully market and/or promote our own core branded products. Any factors that adversely impact the marketing or promotion of our products including, but not limited to, competition, acceptance in the marketplace, or delays related to production and distribution or regulatory issues, will likely have a negative impact on our cash flow and operating results.\nThe commercial success of our products also depends upon various other factors including the quality and acceptance of other competing brands and products; creating effective distribution channels and brand awareness; the availability of alternatives; critical reviews; general economic conditions; and the availability of sufficient capital resources to adequately promote and market our products. Each of these factors is subject to change and cannot be predicted with certainty. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in marketing or promoting any of our own core branded products. If we are unable to successfully market and promote our own core branded products or any enhancements to our products which we may develop, we will not be able to increase our sales, and our results of operations would be adversely affected.\nIf our existing distributors are unable or unwilling to purchase our products and we are unable to secure alternative distributors our operating results and financial condition will be adversely affected.\nWe sell a portion of our products through distributors. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our net sales were $360, of which $76, or 21%, was attributable to Vitamin Shoppe. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our net sales were $526, of which $200, or 38%, was attributable to Cenegenics.\nIn 2018 we launched our websites www.yolked.com and www.myospet.com to go along with www.qurr.com to sell our current brands direct to consumers. Our products can be purchased via the amazon.com site as well.\nIf we decide to continue selling our products to distributors and our existing distributors are unable or unwilling to purchase our products and we are unable to secure alternative distributors or customers, our operating results and financial condition will be adversely affected.\nWe have a history of losses and cash flow deficits, and we expect to continue to operate at a loss and to have negative cash flow for the foreseeable future, which could cause the price of our stock to decline.\nAt December 31, 2018, we had cumulative net losses from inception of $35,067. Our net loss for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were $3,223 and $4,058, respectively. We also had negative cash flows from operating activities. Historically, we have funded our operations from the proceeds from the sale of equity securities, debt issuances, sales of our net operating losses and internally generated funds. Our strategic business plan is likely to result in additional losses and negative cash flow for the foreseeable future. We cannot give assurances that we will ever become profitable.\nThere is no assurance that we will be able to increase our sales.\nOur sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $360 and our sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $526. We cannot give assurances that our current business model will enable us to increase our sales.\nThe report of our independent registered public accounting firm expresses substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur auditors have indicated in their report on our financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 that conditions exist that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern since we may not have sufficient capital resources from operations and existing financing arrangements to meet our operating expenses and working capital requirements. A \u201cgoing concern\u201d opinion could impair our ability to finance our operations through the sale of equity, or other financing alternatives. There can be no assurance that we will be able to generate the level of operating revenues projected in our business plan, or if additional sources of financing will be available on acceptable terms, if at all. If no additional sources of financing become available, our future operating prospects may be adversely affected and investors may lose all or a part of their investment.\nOur intangible assets, which represent a significant amount of our total assets, are subject to impairment testing and may result in impairment charges, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nAt December 31, 2018, our total assets were $4,480, of which $1,245, or approximately 28%, represents intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization. Our intangible assets primarily relate to intellectual property pertaining to Fortetropin\u00ae, including the MYO-T12 formula, trademarks, trade secrets, patent application and domain names acquired from Peak Wellness, Inc. in February 2011. The intellectual property asset was initially recorded as an indefinite-lived intangible asset and tested annually for impairment or more frequently if events or circumstances changed that could potentially reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying value. Impairment testing requires the development of significant estimates and assumptions involving the determination of estimated net cash flows, selection of the appropriate discount rate to measure the risk inherent in future cash flow streams, assessment of an asset\u2019s life cycle, competitive trends impacting the asset as well as other factors. Our forecasted future results and related net cash flows contemplate the direct offering of product and successfully establishing future sales channels among other factors. Changes in these underlying assumptions could significantly impact the asset\u2019s estimated fair value.\nIn 2011, based on (i) assessment of current and expected future economic conditions, (ii) trends, strategies and projected revenues and (iii) assumptions similar to those that market participants would make in valuing our intangible assets, management determined that the carrying values of the intellectual property asset exceeded its fair value. Accordingly, we recorded noncash impairment charges totaling $2,662 and reduced the intellectual property asset to its fair value of $2,000. During the second quarter of 2015, management made an assessment and based on expansion into new markets and introduction of new formulas determined that the intellectual property had a finite useful life of ten (10) years and began amortizing the carrying value of the intellectual property asset over its estimated useful life. Management made a separate determination that no further impairment existed at that time. Based on eighteen (18) consecutive quarters of minimal revenues combined with changes in the sales channels through which we sell our products and our inability to predict future orders, if any, or to what extent we will be able to secure new distribution arrangements, we tested the intellectual property for impairment in the fourth quarter of 2018 and 2017 and determined that the asset value was recoverable and therefore no impairment was recognized.\nWe assess the potential impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets on an annual basis, as well as when interim events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable include disruptions to our business, failure to realize the economic benefit from acquisitions of other companies and intangible assets, slower industry growth rates and declines in operating results and market capitalization. Determining whether an impairment exists, along with the amount of the potential impairment, involves quantitative data and qualitative criteria that are based on estimates and assumptions requiring significant management judgment. Future events, new information or changes in circumstances may alter management\u2019s valuation of an intangible asset. The timing and amount of impairment charges recorded in our consolidated statements of operations and write-downs recorded in our consolidated balance sheets could vary if management\u2019s conclusions change. Accordingly, future impairment testing may result in noncash impairment charges, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe will need to raise additional funds in the future to continue our operations. If we are unable to raise funds as needed, we may not be able to maintain our business.\nWe expect that our current funds will not be sufficient to fund our projected operations through December 2019. We require substantial funds for operating expenses, research and development activities, to establish manufacturing capability, to develop consumer marketing and retail selling capability, and to cover public company costs. The extent of our capital needs will depend on numerous factors, including (i) our profitability, (ii) the release of competitive products, (iii) the level of investment in research and development, (iv) the amount of our capital expenditures, (v) the amount of our working capital including collections on accounts receivable, (vi) the sales, marketing and distribution investment needed to develop and launch our own core branded products and (vii) cash generated by sales of those products. We expect that we will need to seek additional funding in 2019 through public or private financing or through collaborative arrangements with strategic partners.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain additional financing or that such financing would be sufficient to meet our needs. If we cannot obtain additional funding, we may be required to limit our marketing efforts, decrease or eliminate capital expenditures or cease all or a portion of our operations, including any research and development activities. Any available additional financing may not be adequate to meet our goals.\nEven if we are able to locate a source of additional capital and/or financing, we may not be able to negotiate terms and conditions for receiving the additional capital that are acceptable to us.\nAny future capital investments or debt financing, could dilute or otherwise materially adversely affect the holdings or rights of our existing stockholders. In addition, new equity or debt securities issued by us to obtain financing could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to our common stock. Debt financing, if available, would result in increased fixed payment obligations and a portion of our operating cash flows, if any, being dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on such indebtedness. In addition, debt financing may involve agreements that include restrictive covenants that impose operating restrictions, such as restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt, the making of certain capital expenditures or the declaration of dividends. Any additional fundraising efforts may divert our management from their day-to-day activities, which may adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our products. In addition, there is no assurance that any additional financing will be available, or if available, will be on terms favorable to us. In addition, any equity financing would result in dilution to stockholders. In addition, the low recent stock price of our shares may adversely impact our fundraising efforts.\nSince our revenues are generated in U.S. dollars but a portion of our expenses are incurred in foreign currencies, our earnings may be reduced due to currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nOur revenues are generated in U.S. dollars, while a portion of our expenses related to our supply agreement are incurred in foreign currencies, principally the payments to our primary manufacturer that are paid in euros. The exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies fluctuate and are affected by, among other things, changes in political and economic conditions. Any significant fluctuation in the exchange rate for these currencies may materially and adversely affect our earnings, cash flows and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to manage our infrastructure growth, our business results may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe need to manage our infrastructure growth to support and maximize our potential revenue growth and achieve our expected business results. Engaging the full capacity of our limited staff may place a significant strain on our management, operations, and accounting and information systems. We expect that we will need to continue to improve our financial controls, operating procedures and management information systems. The failure to manage our infrastructure growth could adversely affect our business results.\nIf we are not able to implement our business objectives, our operations and financial performance may be adversely affected.\nOur principal objectives are to: (i) create a sales platform through marketing products containing our proprietary ingredient Fortetropin\u00ae in established, growing, and new markets and strategic selection of partnerships and collaborations to maximize near-term and future revenues, (ii) deepen the scientific understanding of the activity of Fortetropin\u00ae, and to leverage this knowledge to strengthen and build our intellectual property, (iii) conduct research and development activities to evaluate the impact of Fortetropin\u00ae on muscle health in both humans and domestic pets, (iv) identify other products and technologies which may broaden our portfolio and define a business development strategy to protect, enhance and accelerate the growth of our products, (v) reduce the cost of manufacturing through process improvement, and (vi) identify contract manufacturing organizations that can fully meet our future growth requirements. Our business plan is based on circumstances currently prevailing and assumptions that certain circumstances will or will not occur as well as the inherent risk and uncertainties involved in various stages of development. However, there is no assurance that we will be successful in achieving our objectives. If we are not able to achieve our objectives, our business operations and financial performance may be adversely affected.\nIf we lose the services of our key personnel, we may be unable to replace them, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur success largely depends on the continued skills, experience, efforts and policies of our management, directors and other key personnel and our ability to continue to attract, motivate and retain highly qualified employees.\nIf one or more of our key employees or directors leaves us, we will need to find a replacement with the combination of skills and attributes necessary to execute our strategy. Because competition for skilled personnel is intense, and the process of finding qualified individuals can be lengthy and expensive, we believe that the loss of the services of key personnel could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot assure you that we will continue to retain such personnel.\nOur success depends on our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing consumer demands.\nOur success depends on the appeal of our current and future products to a broad range of consumers whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to change. If our current and future products do not meet consumer demands, our sales may decline. In addition, our growth depends upon our ability to develop new products through product line extensions and product modifications, which involve numerous risks. We may not be able to accurately identify consumer preferences, translate our knowledge into customer accepted products, establish the appropriate pricing for our products or successfully integrate these products with our existing product platform or operations. We may also experience increased expenses incurred in connection with product development, marketing and advertising that are not subsequently supported by a sufficient level of sales, which would negatively affect our margins. Furthermore, product development may divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could cause sales of our existing products to suffer. We cannot assure you that newly developed products will contribute favorably to our operating results.\nProducts often have to be promoted heavily in stores or in the media to obtain visibility and consumer acceptance. Acquiring distribution for products is difficult and often expensive due to slotting and other promotional charges mandated by retailers. Products can take substantial periods of time to develop consumer awareness, consumer acceptance and sales volume. Accordingly, some products may fail to gain or maintain sufficient sales volume and as a result may have to be discontinued.\nIf our current or future products fail to properly perform, our business could suffer due to increased costs and reduced income. Failure of our current or future products to meet consumer expectations could result in decreased sales, delayed market acceptance of our products, increased accounts receivable, unsaleable inventory and customer returns, and divert our resources to reformulation or alternative products.\nIntense competition from existing and new entities may adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nWe face competitors that will attempt to create, or are already creating, products that are similar to our current and future products. Many of our current and potential competitors have significantly longer operating histories and significantly greater managerial, financial, marketing, technical and other competitive resources, as well as greater brand recognition, than we do. These competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities and customer requirements and may be able to undertake more extensive promotional activities, offer more attractive terms to customers or adopt more aggressive pricing policies. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors or that the competitive pressures we face will not harm our business.\nOur business is dependent on continually developing or acquiring new and advanced products and processes and our failure to do so may cause us to lose our competitiveness and may adversely affect our operating results.\nTo remain competitive in our industry, we believe it is important to continually develop new and advanced products and processes. There is no assurance that competitive new products and processes will not render our existing or new products obsolete or non-competitive. Our competitiveness in the marketplace relies upon our ability to continuously enhance our current products, introduce new products, and develop and implement new technologies and processes. Our failure to evolve and/or develop new or enhanced products may cause us to lose our competitiveness in the marketplace and adversely affect our operating results.\nAdverse publicity or consumer perception of our products and any similar products distributed by others could harm our reputation and adversely affect our sales and revenues.\nWe are highly dependent upon positive consumer perceptions of the safety, efficacy and quality of our products as well as similar products distributed by our competitors. Consumer perception of dietary supplements and our products in particular can be substantially influenced by scientific research or findings, national media attention including social media attention and other publicity about product use. Adverse publicity from such sources regarding the safety, efficacy or quality of dietary supplements, in general, and our products in particular, could harm our reputation and results of operations. The mere publication of reports asserting that such products may be harmful or questioning their efficacy could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, regardless of whether such reports are scientifically supported or whether the claimed harmful effects would be present at the dosages recommended for such products.\nThe use of social media could harm our business and reputation.\nThe use of social media could cause us to suffer brand damage or information leakage. Negative posts or comments about us or our products on any social networking website could damage our, or our products\u2019 reputations. In addition, employees or others might disclose non-public sensitive information relating to our business through external media channels. The continuing evolution of social media may present us with new challenges and risks. The considerable increase in the use of social media over recent years has greatly expanded the potential scope and scale, and increased the rapidity of the dissemination of negative publicity that could be generated by negative posts and comments. Claims and concerns on social media about the safety of our products can result in a negative impact on product sales, product recalls or withdrawals, and/or consumer fraud, product liability and other litigation and claims. A video published online, a blog on the internet, or a post on a website, can be distributed rapidly and negatively harm our business and reputation.\nCyberattacks and other security breaches could compromise our proprietary and confidential information as well as our e-commerce infrastructure and customer database which could harm our business and reputation.\nWe generate, collect and store proprietary information, including intellectual property and business information. The secure storage, maintenance, and transmission of and access to this information is important to our operations and reputation. Computer hackers may attempt to penetrate our computer systems and, if successful, misappropriate our proprietary and confidential information including e-mails and other electronic communications. In addition, an employee, contractor, or other third-party with whom we do business may attempt to obtain such information, and may willfully or inadvertently cause a breach involving such information. While we have certain safeguards in place to reduce the risk of and detect cyber-attacks, our information technology networks and infrastructure may be vulnerable to unpermitted access by hackers or other breaches, or employee error or malfeasance. Any such compromise of our data security and access to, or public disclosure or loss of, confidential business or proprietary information could disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, provide our competitors with valuable information, and subject us to additional costs which could adversely affect our business.\nThe scientific support for Fortetropin\u00ae is subject to uncertainty.\nOur research, scientific knowledge and clinical testing supporting the benefits of our products are essential to our ability to market our products. There is, however, the risk that new or undiscovered information may become available that may undermine or refute our scientific support. In addition, our clinical studies of Fortetropin\u00ae have been limited in scope and additional testing may reveal deficiencies and side effects that we are currently unaware of. A reduction in the credibility of our scientific support for the effectiveness of Fortetropin\u00ae could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.\nIf we are required to withdraw our products from the market, change the labeling of our products and/or are subject to product liability claims, our operations and financial performance may be adversely affected.\nThere is a potential for any ingested product to result in side effects in certain consumers. Although we are not aware of any adverse effects of our products on the health of consumers, if any such side effects are identified after marketing and sale of the product, we may be required to withdraw our products from the market or change its labeling. We may also be required to withdraw our products from the market as a result of regulatory issues. If we are required to withdraw our products from the market, our business operations and financial performance may be adversely affected. Furthermore, if a product liability claim is brought against us, it may, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, result in damage to our reputation, decreased demand for our products, costly litigation and loss of revenue.\nAn increase in product returns could negatively impact our operating results and profitability.\nHistorically, sales allowances for product returns have not been provided, since under our existing arrangements, customers are not permitted to return product except for non-conforming product. In certain instances we may permit the return of damaged or defective products and accept limited amounts of product returns. While such returns have historically been nominal and within management\u2019s expectations and the provisions established, future return rates may differ from those experienced in the past. Any significant increase in damaged or defective products or expected returns could have a material adverse effect on our operating results for the period or periods in which such returns materialize. With respect to future sales, we expect to offer retail customers sales incentives, including the right to return certain agreed upon products. If those customers are not able to sell our products to end-consumers, significant product returns may materialize, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nWe are dependent on third-party manufacturers, suppliers and processors to produce our products.\nWe currently rely on third-party manufacturers, suppliers and processors to produce our products. If our manufacturers, suppliers or processors are unable to provide us with the required finished products or raw materials or are unable or unwilling to produce sufficient quantities of our products, our business and revenues will be adversely affected.\nA shortage in the supply of, or a price increase in, raw materials could increase our costs or adversely affect our sales and revenues.\nAll of the raw materials for our products are sourced from third-party suppliers. Currently, we have one primary third-party manufacturer to produce Fortetropin\u00ae under a fixed price agreement that ran through December 2018. We have not renewed the agreement but we believe we will be able to negotiate a new one before any shortages in our raw materials could adversely affect our operations. Price increases from a supplier will affect our profitability if we are not able to pass price increases on to customers. The inability to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials in a timely manner of our raw materials could limit our ability to sell our products and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWhile our raw material inventories and products generally have a long shelf life, we may be required to write-off or reserve for inventories or products that are slow-moving, off-grade, damaged or otherwise not saleable. Such write-offs and/or reserves could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur raw material inventories are comprised of dried powder derived from egg-yolk, and despite generally having a long shelf life, we may be required to write-off or reserve for inventories and products that are slow-moving, off-grade, damaged or otherwise not saleable. Cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 included slow moving obsolete/damaged goods inventory charges of $-0- and $2, respectively. Future required write-offs or reserves could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have no manufacturing capacity and anticipate continued reliance on third-party manufacturers for the development and commercialization of our products.\nWe do not currently operate manufacturing facilities for production of our product. We lack the resources and the capabilities to manufacture our products on a commercial scale. We rely on third-party manufacturers to produce bulk products required to meet our sales needs. We plan to continue to rely upon contract manufacturers to manufacture commercial quantities of our products.\nOur contract manufacturers\u2019 failure to achieve and maintain high manufacturing standards, in accordance with the FDA\u2019s GMP\u2019s as set forth in 21 CFR Part 111 and/or applicable regulatory requirements, or the incidence of manufacturing errors, could result in consumer injury or death, product shortages, product recalls or withdrawals, delays or failures in product testing or delivery, cost overruns or other problems that could seriously harm our business. Contract manufacturing organizations often encounter difficulties involving production yields, quality control and quality assurance, as well as shortages of qualified personnel. Our existing manufacturers and any future contract manufacturing organizations may not perform as agreed upon or may not remain in the contract manufacturing business. In the event of a natural disaster, business failure, strike or other difficulty, we may be unable to replace a third-party manufacturer in a timely manner and the production of our products would be interrupted, resulting in delays, additional costs and reduced revenues.\nOur research and development activities may be costly and/or untimely, and there are no assurances that our research and development activities will either be successful or completed within the anticipated timeframe, if ever at all.\nResearch and development activities may be costly and/or untimely, and there are no assurances that our research and development activities will either be successful or completed within the anticipated timeframe, if at all. The continued research and development relating to Fortetropin\u00ae and our future products is important to our success. In addition, the development of new products requires significant research, development and testing all of which require significant investment and resources. At this time, our resources are limited and our research and development activities are dependent upon our ability to fund our activities and to raise capital which may not be possible. We have entered and may continue to enter into agreements with third party contract research organizations, academic institutes or non-profit research institutes to engage in research and development for us. However, the failure of the third-party researcher to perform under agreements entered into with us, or our failure to renew important research agreements with a third party, may delay or curtail our research and development efforts. The research and development of new products is costly and time consuming, and there are no assurances that our research and development activities will be successful. Even if a new product is developed, there is no assurance that it will be commercialized or result in sales.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights which could cause our assets to lose value.\nOur business depends on and will continue to depend on our intellectual property, including our valuable brands and internally-developed products. We believe our intellectual property rights are important to our continued success and our competitive position. However, we may be unable or unwilling to strictly enforce our intellectual property rights, including our patents and trademarks, from infringement due to the substantial costs of such enforcement. In addition, while there are patent applications pending, there is no assurance that such applications will issue as patents. Our failure to enforce our intellectual property rights could diminish the value of our brands and product offerings and harm our business and future growth prospects.\nIn addition, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our services, technology and other intellectual property, and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights will prevent any misappropriation or confusion among consumers and merchants, or unauthorized use of these rights. Advancements in technology have exacerbated the risk by making it easier to duplicate and disseminate intellectual property. In addition, as our business becomes more global in scope, we may not be able to protect our proprietary rights in a cost-effective manner in a multitude of jurisdictions with varying laws. If we are unable to procure, protect and enforce our intellectual property rights, we may not realize the full value of these assets, and our business may suffer. If we need to commence litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others, such litigation may be costly and divert the attention of our management.\nWe may be subject to intellectual property rights claims, which are costly to defend, could require us to pay damages and could limit our ability to sell some of our products.\nWe may become subject to intellectual property litigation or infringement claims, which could cause us to incur significant expenses to defend such claims, divert management\u2019s attention or prevent us from manufacturing, importing, selling or using some aspect of our current or future products. If we choose or are forced to settle such claims, we may be required to pay for a license to certain rights, pay royalties on both a retrospective and prospective basis, and/or cease manufacturing importing and selling certain infringing products. Future infringement claims against us by third parties may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur advertising and marketing efforts may be costly and may not achieve desired results.\nWe intend to incur substantial expenses in connection with our advertising and marketing efforts for our products. Although we intend to target our advertising and marketing efforts on current and potential customers who we believe are likely to be in the market for the products we sell, we cannot assure you that our advertising and marketing efforts will achieve our desired results. We will periodically adjust our advertising expenditures in an effort to optimize the return on such expenditures knowing that any such decrease we make to optimize such return could adversely affect our sales.\nWe rely on independent shipping companies to deliver the products we sell.\nWe rely upon third party carriers, especially FedEx and UPS, for timely delivery of our product shipments. As a result, we are subject to carrier disruptions and increased costs due to factors that are beyond our control, including employee strikes, inclement weather and increased fuel costs. Any failure to deliver products to our customers in a timely and accurate manner may damage our reputation and brand and could cause us to lose customers. We do not have a written long-term agreement with any of these third party carriers, and we cannot be sure that these relationships will continue on terms favorable to us, if at all. If our relationship with any of these third party carriers is terminated or impaired, or if any of these third parties are unable to deliver products for us, we would be required to use alternatives for shipment of products to our customers. We may be unable to engage alternative carriers on a timely basis or on terms favorable to us, if at all. Potential adverse consequences include reduced visibility of order status and package tracking; delays in order processing and product delivery; increased cost of delivery, resulting in reduced margins; and reduced shipment quality, which may result in damaged products and customer dissatisfaction. Furthermore, shipping costs represent a significant operational expense for us. Any future increases in shipping rates could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on fulfillment centers to package and deliver our product to customers who place orders online\nWe have an agreement with one fulfillment center to box and ship our products to customers once an order has been placed. We cannot be sure that our relationship with the fulfillment center will continue on terms favorable to us, if at all. If our relationship with them is terminated or impaired, or if they are unable to deliver products for us, we would be required to use alternatives for shipment of products to our customers.\nWe face significant inventory risk.\nWe are exposed to significant inventory risks that may adversely affect our operating results as a result of new product launches, rapid changes in product cycles and pricing, defective merchandise, changes in consumer demand and consumer spending patterns, changes in consumer tastes with respect to our products, and other factors. In addition, our products may be less effective if they remain in storage for a significant period of time. We endeavor to accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or understocking our products. Demand for products, however, can change significantly between the time inventory is ordered and the date of sale. In addition, when we begin selling or manufacturing a new product, it may be difficult to determine appropriate product selection, and accurately forecast demand. The acquisition of inventory may require significant lead-time and prepayment and we may be unable to sell products in sufficient quantities or during the relevant selling seasons. Any one of these risks may adversely affect our operating results.\nOur failure to respond appropriately to competitive challenges, changing consumer preferences and demand for new products could significantly harm our customer relationships and product sales.\nThe nutritional supplement industry is characterized by intense competition for product offerings and rapid and frequent changes in consumer demand. Our failure to predict accurately product trends could negatively impact our products and cause our revenues to decline.\nOur success with any particular product offering (whether new or existing) depends upon a number of factors, including our ability to:\n\u25cf deliver quality products in a timely manner in sufficient volumes;\n\u25cf accurately anticipate customer needs and forecast accurately to our manufacturers;\n\u25cf differentiate our product offerings from those of our competitors;\n\u25cf competitively price our products; and\n\u25cf develop new products.\nFurthermore, products often have to be promoted heavily in stores or in the media to obtain visibility and consumer acceptance. Acquiring distribution for products is difficult and often expensive due to slotting and other promotional charges mandated by retailers. Products can take substantial periods of time to develop consumer awareness, consumer acceptance and sales volume. Accordingly, some products may fail to gain or maintain sufficient sales volume and as a result may have to be discontinued.\nOur industry is highly competitive, and our failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our market share, financial condition and future growth.\nThe nutritional supplement industry is highly competitive with respect to:\n\u25cf price;\n\u25cf shelf space and store placement;\n\u25cf brand and product recognition;\n\u25cf product introductions; and\n\u25cf raw materials.\nMost of our competitors are larger, more established companies and possess greater financial strength, personnel, distribution and other resources than we have. We face competition in the supplement market from a number of large nationally known manufacturers, private label brands and many smaller manufacturers.\nAdverse publicity or consumer perception of our products and any similar products distributed by others could harm our reputation and adversely affect our sales.\nWe believe we are highly dependent upon positive consumer perceptions of the safety and quality of our products as well as similar products distributed by other nutritional supplement companies. Consumer perception of nutritional supplements and our products in particular can be substantially influenced by scientific research or findings, national media attention and other publicity about product use. Adverse publicity from these sources regarding the safety, quality or efficacy of nutritional supplements and our products could harm our reputation and results of operations. The mere publication of news articles or reports asserting that such products may be harmful or questioning their efficacy could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, regardless of whether such news articles or reports are scientifically supported or whether the claimed harmful effects would be present at the dosages recommended for such products.\nChanges in the economies of the markets in which we do business may affect consumer demand for our products.\nConsumer spending habits, including spending for our products, are affected by, among other things, prevailing economic conditions, levels of employment, fuel prices, changes in exchange rates, salaries and wages, the availability of consumer credit, consumer confidence and consumer perception of economic conditions. Economic slowdowns in the markets in which we do business and an uncertain economic outlook may adversely affect consumer spending habits, which may result in lower sales of our products in future periods. A prolonged global or regional economic downturn could have a material negative impact on our financial position, results of operation or cash flows.\nOur insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover our legal claims or other losses that we may incur in the future.\nWe maintain insurance, including property, general and product liability and other forms of insurance to protect ourselves against potential loss exposures. In the future, insurance coverage may not be available at adequate levels or on adequate terms to cover potential losses. If insurance coverage is inadequate or unavailable, we may face claims that exceed coverage limits or that are not covered, which could increase our costs and adversely affect our operating results.\nWe may be subject to uncertain and costly compliance with government regulations.\nThe importing, manufacturing, processing, formulating, packaging, labeling, distributing, selling and advertising of our current and future products may be subject to regulation by one or more federal or state agencies. The Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, has primary jurisdiction over our products pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, as amended by the Dietary Supplement and Health Education Act, or the DSHEA, and regulations promulgated thereunder. The DSHEA provides the regulatory framework for the safety and labeling of dietary supplements, foods and medical foods. In particular, the FDA regulates the safety, manufacturing, labeling and distribution of dietary supplements. In addition, the Animal Plant Health and Inspection Service, or APHIS, regulates the importation of our primary product from Germany. The Federal Trade Commission, or the FTC, and the FDA share jurisdiction over the promotion and advertising of dietary supplements. Pursuant to a memorandum of understanding between the two agencies, the FDA has primary jurisdiction over claims that appear on product labels and labeling and the FTC has primary jurisdiction over product advertising.\nCompliance with applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations is a critical part of our business. We endeavor to comply with all applicable laws and regulations. However, as with any regulated industry, the laws and regulations are subject to interpretation and there can be no assurances that a government agency would necessarily agree with our interpretation of the governing laws and regulations. Moreover, we are unable to predict the nature of such future laws, regulations, interpretations or applications, nor can we predict what effect additional governmental regulations or administrative orders, when and if promulgated, would have on our business in the future. These regulations could, however, require the reformulation of our products to meet new standards, market withdrawal or discontinuation of certain products not able to be reformulated. The risk of a product recall exists within the industry although we endeavor to minimize the risk of recalls by distributing products that are not adulterated or misbranded. However, the decision to initiate a recall is often made for business reasons in order to avoid confrontation with the FDA.\nOur products are required to be prepared in compliance with cGMPs and 21 CFR Part 111 (also known as the FDA\u2019s \u201cDietary Supplement Rule\u201d). Fortetropin\u00ae, the main ingredient in our products, is also required to be imported into the United States in conformance with APHIS\u2019s requirements for egg products. In the event it is determined that we have not complied with the foregoing requirements, we may be required to initiate a product recall and/or be subject to financial or other penalties. We are continuously monitoring and reviewing our processes to ensure compliance with APHIS and limit the likelihood of potential recalls.\nOther statutory obligations include reporting all serious adverse events on a Medwatch Form 3500A. To date, we have not filed a Medwatch Form 3500A with the FDA nor have we been placed on notice regarding any serious adverse events related to any of our products. Since eggs are considered a major food allergen under the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act of 2004, the labeling of all our products must note that they contain an egg product.\nAdvertising of dietary supplement products is subject to regulation by the FTC under the Federal Trade Commission Act, or FTCA, which prohibits unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive trade acts or practices in or affecting commerce. The FTCA provides that the dissemination of any false advertising pertaining to foods, including dietary supplements, is an unfair or deceptive act or practice. Under the FTC\u2019s substantiation doctrine, an advertiser is required to have a reasonable basis for all objective product claims before the claims are made. All advertising is required to be truthful and not misleading. All testimonials are required to be typical of the results the consumer may expect when using the product as directed. Accordingly, we are required to have adequate substantiation of all material advertising claims made for our products. Failure to adequately substantiate claims may be considered either deceptive or unfair practices.\nWe cannot predict what effect additional domestic or international governmental legislation, regulations, or administrative orders, when and if promulgated, would have on our business in the future. New legislation or regulations may require the reformulation of certain products to meet new standards, require the recall or discontinuance of certain products not capable of reformulation, impose additional record keeping or require expanded documentation of the properties of certain products, expanded or different labeling or scientific substantiation.\nRecent U.S. tax legislation could adversely affect our business and financial condition\nOn December 22, 2017, U.S. tax reform legislation known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTCJA\u201d) was signed into law. The TCJA makes substantial changes to U.S. tax law, including reducing the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from thirty-five percent to twenty-one percent. Changes in tax law are accounted for in the period of enactment. In addition, Federal net operating losses (\u201cNOL\u201d) generated during future periods will be carried forward indefinitely, but will be subject to an eighty percent utilization against taxable income. The carryback provision has been revoked for NOL after January 1, 2018. The IRS continues to issue guidance and interpretations regarding the TCJA which are subject to additional regulatory or administrative developments, including any regulations or other guidance promulgated by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, and other regulators. The TCJA contains numerous, complex provisions impacting U.S. companies, and we continue to review and assess the legislative language and guidance promulgated by the IRS and other regulators to determine the TCJA\u2019s full impact on us. Further, we can provide no assurance our current interpretations of, and assumptions regarding, the TCJA and any related regulations or guidance will not be reviewed or investigated by regulators in the future. We urge our stockholders to consult with their tax advisors with respect to the TCJA and the potential tax consequences of investing in our common stock.\nWe are exposed to risks related to cybersecurity threats and general information security incidents which may also expose us to liability under data protection laws including the GDPR.\nIn the conduct of our business, we increasingly collect, use, transmit and store data on information technology systems. This data includes confidential information belonging to us, our customers and other business partners, as well as personally identifiable information of individuals, including our employees. We have experienced, and expect to continue to be subject to, cybersecurity threats and incidents, ranging from employee error or misuse to individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to information technology systems, to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats, none of which have been material to date.\nAlthough we devote resources to network security, data encryption and other measures to protect our information technology systems and data from unauthorized access or misuse, including those measures necessary to meet certain information security standards that may be required by our customers, there can be no assurance that these measures will be successful in preventing a cybersecurity or general information security incident. We also rely in part on the reliability of certain tested third parties\u2019 cybersecurity measures, including firewalls, virus solutions and backup solutions, and our business may be affected if these third-party resources are compromised.\nCybersecurity incidents may result in business disruption, the misappropriation, corruption or loss of confidential information (including personally identifiable information) and critical data (ours or that of third parties), reputational damage, litigation with third parties, regulatory fines, diminution in the value of our investment in research and development and data privacy issues and increased information security protection and remediation costs. As these cybersecurity threats, and government and regulatory oversight of associated risks continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to remediate, enhance or expand upon the cybersecurity protection and security measures we currently maintain. For example, we are subject to the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which became enforceable from May 25, 2018. The GDPR introduced a number of new obligations for subject companies resulting in the need to continue dedicating financial resources and management time to GDPR compliance. While we have taken steps to ensure compliance with the GDPR, there can be no assurance that the measures we have taken will be successful in preventing an incident, including a cybersecurity incident or other data breach, which results in a breach of the GDPR. Individuals who have suffered damage as a result of a subject company\u2019s non-compliance with the GDPR also have the right to seek compensation from such a company.\nFuture cybersecurity breaches, general information security incidents, further increases in data protection costs or failure to comply with relevant legal obligations regarding protection of data could therefore have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nFailure to comply with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.\nWe are subject to the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which generally prohibits United States companies from engaging in bribery or other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Foreign companies, including some that may compete with us, are not subject to these prohibitions. To our knowledge, none of our employees or other agents have engaged in such practices. However, if our employees or other agents are found to have engaged in such practices, we could suffer severe penalties and other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK\nTrading in our common stock over the last 12 months has fluctuated, so investors may not be able to sell as many of their shares as they want at prevailing prices.\nOur common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market. There has been a fluctuation in trading of our shares over the last 12 months, but it still may be difficult for investors to sell such shares in the public market at any given time.\nOur common stock may be delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market if we cannot satisfy its continued listing requirements.\nAmong the conditions required for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market is that we maintain at least $2.5 million in stockholders\u2019 equity. There can be no assurance that our stockholders\u2019 equity will remain above the $2.5 million minimum. If we fail to timely comply with the stockholders\u2019 equity requirement, our common stock may be delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market. In addition, even if we demonstrate compliance with the stockholders\u2019 equity requirement, we will need to continue to meet other objective and subjective listing requirements to continue to be listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market. Delisting from the Nasdaq Capital Market could make trading our common stock more difficult for investors, potentially leading to declines in our share price and liquidity. Without a Nasdaq Capital Market listing, stockholders may have a difficult time getting a quote for the sale or purchase of our common stock, the sale or purchase of our common stock would likely be made more difficult and the trading volume and liquidity of our stock could decline. Delisting from the Nasdaq Capital Market could also result in negative publicity and could also make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital. The absence of such a listing may adversely affect the acceptance of our common stock as currency or the value accorded by other parties. Further, if we are delisted, we would be required to incur additional costs under state blue sky laws in connection with any sale of our securities. These requirements could severely limit the market liquidity of our common stock and the ability of our stockholders to sell our common stock in the secondary market. If our common stock is delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market, our common stock may be eligible to trade on an over-the-counter quotation system, such as the OTCQB market, where an investor may find it more difficult to sell our stock or obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of our common stock. We cannot assure you that our common stock, if delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market, will be listed on another national securities exchange or quoted on an over-the-counter quotation system.\nIf the Nasdaq Capital Market delists our shares of common stock from trading on its exchange and we are not able to list our securities on another national securities exchange, we expect our securities could be quoted on an over-the-counter market. If this were to occur, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including:\n\u25cf a limited availability of market quotations for our securities;\n\u25cf reduced liquidity for our shares;\n\u25cf a determination that our common stock is a \u201cpenny stock\u201d which will require brokers trading in our common stock to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our shares;\n\u25cf a limited amount of news and analyst coverage; and\n\u25cf a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nAn active and visible trading market for our common stock may not develop.\nWe cannot predict whether an active market for our common stock will develop in the future. In the absence of an active trading market:\n\u25cf investors may have difficulty buying and selling our common stock or obtaining market quotations;\n\u25cf market visibility for our common stock may be limited; and\n\u25cf a lack of visibility for our common stock may have a depressive effect on the market price.\nThe trading price of our common stock is expected to be subject to significant fluctuations in response to variations in quarterly operating results, changes in analysts\u2019 earnings estimates, announcements of innovations by us or our competitors, general conditions in the industry in which we operate and other factors. These fluctuations, as well as general economic and market conditions, may have a material or adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nThe market price for our stock may be volatile.\nThe market price for our stock may be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors including the following:\n\u25cf actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results;\n\u25cf changes in financial estimates by securities research analysts;\n\u25cf conditions in nutritional supplement markets;\n\u25cf changes in the economic performance or market valuations of other nutritional supplement companies;\n\u25cf announcements by us or our competitors of new products, new clinical studies, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u25cf addition or departure of key personnel;\n\u25cf intellectual property prosecution or other litigation; and\n\u25cf general economic or political conditions.\nIn addition, the securities market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are not related to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our stock.\nOur stockholders may experience significant dilution if future equity offerings are used to fund operations or acquire complementary businesses or as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of shares of common stock upon the exercise of outstanding options and warrants.\nIf our future operations or acquisitions are financed through the issuance of equity securities, our stockholders could experience significant dilution. In addition, securities issued in connection with future financing activities or potential acquisitions may have rights and preferences senior to the rights and preferences of our common stock. We have also reserved 850,000 shares of our common stock under an equity incentive plan for our directors, officers, employees, consultants and advisors and granted options to purchase shares of our common stock under the plan. The issuance of shares of our common stock upon the exercise of these options as well as upon the exercise of outstanding warrants to purchase up to 821,202 shares of our common stock, which includes a warrant to purchase 375,000 shares of common stock previously issued to RENS Technology Inc., may result in significant dilution to our stockholders.\nMr. Ren can exert significant influence over us and make decisions that are not in the best interests of all stockholders.\nMr. Ren and his affiliates currently beneficially own 1,897,568 shares, or approximately 20.7% of our outstanding shares of common stock. As a result, he is able to assert influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election and removal of directors and any change in control. In particular, this concentration of ownership of our outstanding shares of common stock could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control, or otherwise discouraging or preventing a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control. This, in turn, could have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock. It could also prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium over the market prices for their shares of common stock. In addition, we are currently involved in litigation with Mr. Ren and RENS Technology Inc. See \u201cBusiness - Legal Proceedings\u201d for additional information regarding the litigation. Moreover, the interests of the owners of this concentration of ownership may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders and, accordingly, could cause us to enter into transactions or agreements that we would not otherwise consider.\nOur affiliates may control our company for the foreseeable future, including the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval.\nOur officers, directors, and five percent stockholders collectively beneficially own 4,966,397 or approximately 54.2% of our outstanding shares of common stock, and shares of common stock to be issued upon the exercise of stock option and warrants. This concentration of voting power and control could have a significant effect in delaying, deferring or preventing an action that might otherwise be beneficial to our other stockholders and be disadvantageous to our stockholders with interests different from those entities and individuals. Certain of these individuals also have significant control over our business, policies and affairs as officers or directors of our company.\nCompliance with changing corporate governance regulations and public disclosure, and our management\u2019s inexperience with such regulations, will result in additional expenses and creates a risk of non-compliance.\nOur reporting obligations as a public company will place a significant strain on our management, operational and financial resources and systems for the foreseeable future. Changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related SEC regulations, have created uncertainty for public companies and significantly increased the costs and risks associated with accessing the public markets and public reporting. Our management team will need to invest significant time and financial resources to comply with both existing and evolving standards for public companies, which will lead to increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities.\nWe do not foresee paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future and, as a result, our investors\u2019 sole source of gain, if any, will depend on capital appreciation, if any.\nWe do not plan to declare or pay any cash dividends on our shares of common stock in the foreseeable future and currently intend to retain any future earnings for funding growth. As a result, investors should not rely on an investment in our securities if they require the investment to produce dividend income. Capital appreciation, if any, of our shares may be investors\u2019 sole source of gain for the foreseeable future. Moreover, investors may not be able to resell their common stock at or above the price they paid for them.\nProvisions in our charter documents, the shareholder rights plan we have adopted, and under Nevada law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable.\nOur articles of incorporation provides for the authorization to issue up to 500,000 shares of blank check preferred stock with designations, rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by our board of directors. Our board of directors is empowered, without stockholder approval, to issue a series of preferred stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights which could dilute the interest of, or impair the voting power of, our common stockholders. The issuance of a series of preferred stock could be used as a method of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control. For example, it would be possible for our board of directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to change control of our company. In addition, we have a classified board of directors that consists of three groups, which may increase the length of time necessary for an acquirer to change the composition of a majority of directors to gain control of our board of directors.\nWe have also adopted a shareholder rights plan that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or could discourage a third party from acquiring, us or a large block of our common stock. A third party that acquires 10% or more of our common stock could suffer substantial dilution of its ownership interest under the terms of the shareholder rights plan through the issuance of our shares to all stockholders other than the acquiring person. These and other provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirers to obtain control of our board of directors or initiate actions that are opposed by our then-current board of directors, including a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest involving our company. Any delay or prevention of a change of control transaction or changes in our board of directors could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nProvisions of Nevada corporate law limit the personal liability of corporate directors and officers and require indemnification under certain circumstances.\nSection 78.138(7) of the Nevada Revised Statutes provides that, subject to certain very limited statutory exceptions or unless the articles of incorporation provide for greater individual liability, a director or officer of a Nevada corporation is not individually liable to the corporation or its stockholders for any damages as a result of any act or failure to act in his or her capacity as a director or officer, unless it is proven that the act or failure to act constituted a breach of his or her fiduciary duties as a director or officer and such breach involved intentional misconduct, fraud or a knowing violation of law. We have not included in our articles of incorporation any provision intended to provide for greater liability as contemplated by this statutory provision.\nIn addition, Section 78.7502(3) of the Nevada Revised Statutes provides that to the extent a director or officer of a Nevada corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in the defense of certain actions, suits or proceedings (which may include certain stockholder derivative actions), the corporation shall indemnify such director or officer against expenses (including attorneys\u2019 fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such director or officer in connection therewith.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they change their recommendations regarding our stock adversely, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. We do not currently have and may never obtain significant research coverage by industry or financial analysts. If few analysts commence coverage of us, the trading price of our stock would likely decrease. Even if we do obtain significant analyst coverage, if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nA failure of our internal control over financial reporting could materially impact our business or share price.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. An internal control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all internal control systems, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud, and could expose us to litigation or adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR FUTURE PRODUCTS\nThe research and development of pharmaceutical products, which is separate from nutritional supplements, entails special considerations and risks. If we are successful in developing pharmaceutical products for muscular disorders, we will be subject to, and possibly adversely affected by, the following risks:\nOur failure to obtain costly government approvals, including required FDA approvals, or to comply with ongoing governmental regulations relating to our technologies and proposed products and formulations could delay or limit introduction of our proposed formulations and products and result in failure to achieve revenues or maintain our ongoing business.\nOur research and development activities for our products and product candidates are currently at an early development stage and are subject to extensive regulation for safety, efficacy and quality by numerous government authorities in the United States and abroad. Before receiving FDA regulatory clearance to market our future proposed formulations and products, we will have to demonstrate that our formulations and products are safe and effective in the patient population and for the indicated diseases that are to be treated. Clinical trials, manufacturing and marketing of drugs are subject to the rigorous testing and approval process of the FDA and equivalent foreign regulatory authorities such as the European Medicines Agency (EMA). The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and other federal, state and foreign statutes and regulations govern and influence the testing, manufacturing, labeling, advertising, distribution and promotion of drugs and medical devices. As a result, regulatory approvals can take a number of years or longer to accomplish and require the expenditure of substantial financial, managerial and other resources.\nConducting and completing the clinical trials necessary for FDA approval is costly and subject to intense regulatory scrutiny as well as the risk of failing to meet the primary endpoint of such trials. We will not be able to commercialize and sell our future products and formulations without successfully completing such trials.\nIn order to conduct clinical trials that are necessary to obtain approval by the FDA to market a formulation or product, it is necessary to receive clearance from the FDA to conduct such clinical trials. The FDA can halt clinical trials at any time for safety reasons or because we or our clinical investigators did not follow the FDA\u2019s requirements for conducting clinical trials. If we are unable to receive clearance to conduct clinical trials or the trials are permanently halted by the FDA, we would not be able to achieve any revenue from such product as it is illegal to sell any drug or medical device for human consumption or use without FDA approval.\nData obtained from clinical trials are susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory clearances.\nData we may obtain in the future, from non-clinical studies and clinical trials do not necessarily predict the results that will be obtained from later-stage non-clinical studies and clinical trials. Moreover, non-clinical and clinical data are susceptible to multiple and varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after promising results in earlier trials. The failure to adequately demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of a proposed formulation or product under development could delay or prevent regulatory clearance of the product candidate, resulting in delays to commercialization, and could materially harm our business. In addition, our clinical trials may not demonstrate sufficient levels of safety and efficacy necessary to obtain the requisite regulatory approvals for our drugs, and thus our proposed drugs may not be approved for marketing. Finally, if any of our clinical trials do not meet their primary endpoints, we would need to repeat such clinical trials in order to progress the development of the investigational drug candidate. These additional trials would be costly and divert resources from other projects.\nCompetitors may develop competing technologies or products which outperform or supplant our technologies or products.\nDrug companies and/or biotechnology companies may in the future seek to develop and market pharmaceutical products which may compete with our future technologies and products. Competitors may in the future develop similar or different technologies or products which may become more accepted by the marketplace or which may supplant our technology entirely. In addition, many of our future competitors may be significantly larger and better financed than we are, thus giving them a significant advantage over us.\nWe may be unable to respond to competitive forces presently in the marketplace (including competition from larger companies), which would severely impact our business. Moreover, should competing or dominating technologies or products come into existence and the owners thereof patent the applicable technological advances, we could also be required to license such technologies in order to continue to manufacture, market and sell our products. We may be unable to secure such licenses on commercially acceptable terms, or at all, and our resulting inability to manufacture, market and sell the affected products could have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe market for our product candidates is rapidly changing and competitive, and new drug delivery mechanisms, drug delivery technologies, new drugs and new treatments which may be developed by others could impair our ability to maintain and grow our business and remain competitive.\nEven if successfully developed, our product candidates may not gain market acceptance among physicians, patients and healthcare payers, which may not utilize our products. If our product candidates do not achieve market acceptance, our business and financial condition will be materially adversely affected. The pharmaceutical industry is subject to rapid and substantial technological change. Developments by others may render our technologies and our product candidates noncompetitive or obsolete, or we may be unable to keep pace with technological developments or other market factors. Technological competition from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, universities, government entities and others now existing or diversifying into the field is intense and is expected to increase. Many of these entities have significantly greater research and development capabilities, human resources and budgets than we do, as well as substantially more marketing, manufacturing, financial and managerial resources. These entities represent significant competition for us. Acquisitions of, or investments in, competing pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies by large corporations could increase such competitors\u2019 financial, marketing, manufacturing and other resources.\nThe market for our future products is rapidly changing and competitive, and new drug delivery mechanisms, drug delivery technologies, new drugs and new treatments which may be developed by others could impair our ability to maintain and grow our business and remain competitive.\nEven if successfully developed, our future products may not gain market acceptance among physicians, patients and healthcare payers, which may not utilize our products.
