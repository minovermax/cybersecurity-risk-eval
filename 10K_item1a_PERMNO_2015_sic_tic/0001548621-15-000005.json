{"cik": "1548621", "company": "NPC Restaurant Holdings, LLC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors.\nOur business operations and the implementation of our business strategy are subject to significant risks inherent in our business, including, without limitation, the risks and uncertainties described below. The occurrence of any one or more of the risks or uncertainties described below could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Because these forward-looking statements are based on estimates and assumptions that are subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control or are subject to change, actual results could be materially different.\nChanges in consumer discretionary spending and general economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nPurchases at our stores are discretionary for consumers and, therefore, our results of operations are susceptible to economic slowdowns and recessions. Our results of operations are dependent upon discretionary spending by consumers, particularly by consumers living in the communities in which our restaurants are located. A significant portion of our stores are clustered in certain geographic areas. A significant weakening in the local economies of these geographic areas, or any of the areas in which our stores are located, may cause consumers to curtail discretionary spending, which in turn could reduce our store sales and have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Some of the factors that impact discretionary consumer spending include unemployment, disposable income and consumer confidence. These and other macroeconomic factors could have an adverse effect on our sales mix, profitability or development plans, which could harm our financial condition and operating results.\nIncreases in food, labor and other costs could adversely affect our profitability and operating results.\nAn increase in our operating costs could adversely affect our profitability. Factors such as inflation, including but not limited to, increased food costs, increased labor and employee benefit cost and increased energy costs may adversely affect our operating costs. Additionally, significant increases in gasoline prices could result in a decrease of customer traffic at our units and increased operating costs. Most of the factors affecting cost are beyond our control and, in many cases, we may not be able to pass along these increased costs to our customers. Most ingredients used in our products, particularly cheese, beef, dough and meats, which are the largest components of our food costs, are subject to significant price fluctuations as a result of seasonality, weather, demand and other factors. While we have developed strategies to mitigate or partially offset the impact of higher commodity costs, there can be no assurances such measures will be successful. In addition, no assurances can be given that the magnitude and duration of these cost increases or any future cost increases will not have a larger adverse impact on our profitability and consolidated financial position than currently anticipated.\nThe estimated increase in our food costs from a hypothetical $0.10 adverse change in the average cheese block price per pound would have been approximately $4.3 million in 2014, without giving effect to the RSCS directed hedging programs. In addition, our participation in the food hedging programs directed by RSCS may hedge less than half of our cheese purchases and therefore may not adequately protect us from price fluctuations.\nWage rates for a substantial number of our employees are at or slightly above the minimum wage. As federal and/or state minimum wage rates increase, we may need to increase not only the wage rates of our minimum wage employees but also the wages paid to the employees at wage rates which are above the minimum wage, which will increase our costs. Approximately 30% of our units operate in states where the state minimum wage rate exceeds the federal minimum wage rate. We currently expect that 33% of our total units will incur an increase in state minimum wage rates in 2015, while 29% of total units experienced an increase in 2014. In addition, there are currently a number of federal and state initiatives and proposals to further increase minimum wage rates.\nWe are highly dependent on the Pizza Hut system and our success is tied to the success of PHI\u2019s brand strength, marketing campaigns and product innovation. In addition, our Wendy's units are dependent upon the strength of Wendy\u2019s brand, marketing and product innovation.\nWe are a franchisee of PHI and are highly dependent on PHI for our operations. Due to the nature of franchising and our agreements with PHI, our success is, to a large extent, directly related to the success of the Pizza Hut restaurant system, including the financial condition, management and marketing success of PHI and the successful operation of Pizza Hut restaurants owned by other franchisees. Further, if Yum! were to reallocate resources away from the Pizza Hut brand in favor of its other brands, the Pizza Hut brand could be harmed, which would have a material adverse effect on our operating results. These strategic decisions and PHI\u2019s future strategic decisions may not be in our best interests and may conflict with our strategic plans.\nOur ability to compete effectively depends upon the success of the management of the Pizza Hut system; for example, we depend on PHI\u2019s introduction of innovative products, promotions and advertising to differentiate us from our competitors, drive sales and maintain the strength of the Pizza Hut brand. If PHI fails to introduce successful innovative products and launch effective marketing campaigns, our sales may suffer. As a result, any failure of the Pizza Hut system to compete effectively would likely have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nUnder our franchise agreements with PHI, we are required to comply with operational programs and standards established by PHI. In particular, PHI maintains discretion over the menu items that we can offer in our restaurants. If we fail to comply with PHI\u2019s standards of operations, PHI has various rights, including the right to terminate the applicable franchise agreement, redefine the franchise territory or terminate our right to establish additional restaurants in a territory. The franchise agreements may also be terminated upon the occurrence of certain events, such as the insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company. If any of our franchise agreements were terminated or any of our franchise rights were limited, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be harmed.\nPHI must also approve the acquisition or opening of any new restaurant and the closing of any of our existing restaurants. Therefore, PHI could limit our ability to expand our operations through acquisitions and require us to continue operating under-performing units. In addition, the franchise agreements contain restrictions on our ability to raise equity capital and require approval to effect a change of control.\nSimilar to our franchise relationship with PHI, the success of our Wendy's units is, to a large extent, directly related to the success of the Wendy\u2019s restaurant system, including the financial condition, management, food quality and innovation and marketing success of Wendy\u2019s and the successful operation of Wendy's restaurants owned by other franchisees. Any failure of the Wendy\u2019s restaurant system to compete effectively would likely have a material adverse effect on the operating results of our Wendy's units. We are parties to franchise agreements with Wendy\u2019s which govern the operation of all of our Wendy's restaurants, and may be terminated by Wendy\u2019s upon certain events, including our failure to comply with the standards or procedures set forth in the franchise agreements or our bankruptcy or insolvency. Wendy\u2019s must approve the acquisition or opening of any new restaurant and the closing of any of our existing restaurants. Therefore, Wendy\u2019s could limit our ability to expand our operations through acquisitions and require us to continue operating under-performing units.\nThe U.S. Quick Service Restaurant market is highly competitive, and that competition could affect our operating results.\nWe compete on a broad scale with Quick Service Restaurants, or \u201cQSRs,\u201d and other national, regional and local restaurants. The overall food service market generally and the QSR market, in particular, are intensely competitive with respect to price, service, location, personnel and type and quality of food. Other key competitive factors include the number and location of restaurants, quality and speed of service, attractiveness of facilities, effectiveness of advertising and marketing programs, and new product development by PHI and Wendy\u2019s and their competitors. In addition, we compete within the food service market and the QSR sector not only for customers, but also for management and hourly employees and suitable real estate sites. If we are unable to maintain our competitive position, we could experience downward pressure on prices, lower\ndemand for our products, reduced margins, the inability to take advantage of new business opportunities and the loss of market share, which would have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nOur annual and quarterly financial results may fluctuate depending on various factors, including seasonality of the business, many of which are beyond our control.\nOur sales and operating results can vary from quarter to quarter and year to year depending on various factors, which include:\n\u2022\nvariations in timing and volume of our sales;\n\u2022\nsales promotions by us and our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in average comparable store sales and customer visits;\n\u2022\nvariations in the price, availability and shipping costs of our supplies;\n\u2022\nthe development and introduction of new menu offerings that appeal to changing consumer preferences;\n\u2022\ntiming of holidays or other significant events;\n\u2022\nseasonality of demand; and\n\u2022\nchanges in competitive and economic conditions generally.\nCertain of the foregoing events may directly and immediately decrease demand for our products, and therefore, may result in an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flow.\nIn addition, our Pizza Hut business is moderately seasonal in nature with net product sales typically being higher in the first half of the year. Our Wendy\u2019s business is also moderately seasonal in nature with net product sales typically being higher in the spring and summer months.\nWe face risks associated with litigation from customers, employees and others in the ordinary course of business.\nClaims of illness or injury relating to food quality or food handling are common in the food service industry. In addition, class action lawsuits have been filed, and may continue to be filed, against various QSRs alleging, among other things, that they have failed to disclose the health risks associated with high-fat foods and that their marketing practices have encouraged obesity. In addition to decreasing our sales and profitability and diverting our management resources, adverse publicity or a substantial judgment against us could negatively impact the brand reputation of Pizza Hut or Wendy\u2019s, hindering our ability to grow our business.\nFurther, we may be subject to employee and other claims in the future based on, among other things, discrimination, harassment, wrongful termination and wage, rest break and meal break issues, including those relating to overtime compensation. These types of claims, as well as other types of lawsuits to which we are subject from time to time, can distract our management\u2019s attention from our business operations. We have been subject to these types of claims, and if one or more of these claims were to be successful, or if there is a significant increase in the number of these claims, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, since certain of our restaurants serve alcoholic beverages, we are subject to \u201cdram shop\u201d statutes. These statutes generally allow a person injured by an intoxicated person to recover damages from an establishment that wrongfully served alcoholic beverages to the intoxicated person. Litigation against restaurant chains has resulted in significant judgments and settlements under dram shop statutes. Because such a plaintiff seeks punitive damages, which may not be covered by insurance, such litigation could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Regardless of whether any claims against us are valid or whether we are liable, claims may be expensive to defend and may divert time and money away from our operations and hurt our performance. A judgment significantly in excess of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Further, adverse publicity resulting from these allegations may materially affect us and our restaurants.\nIncidents involving food-borne illnesses, food tampering or other concerns can cause damage to our franchisors\u2019 brands and swiftly affect our sales and profitability.\nIf our customers become ill from food-borne illnesses or as a result of food tampering, we could be forced to temporarily close some restaurants. We cannot guarantee that our operational controls and employee training will be effective in preventing food-borne illnesses and other food safety issues that may affect our restaurants. Incidents involving food-borne illness or food tampering could be caused by food suppliers and transporters and, therefore, would be outside of our control.\nWe are subject to extensive government and industry regulation, and our failure to comply with existing or increased regulations could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those relating to:\n\u2022\nthe preparation and sale of food;\n\u2022\nliquor licenses which allow us to serve alcoholic beverages;\n\u2022\nbuilding and zoning requirements;\n\u2022\nenvironmental protection;\n\u2022\nminimum wage, overtime and other labor requirements;\n\u2022\ncompliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990;\n\u2022\ncompliance with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the related Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010;\n\u2022\nindustry regulation regarding credit card information;\n\u2022\nreporting of credit card information; and\n\u2022\nworking and safety conditions;\nIn recent years there has been an increased legislative, regulatory and consumer focus on nutrition and advertising practices in the food industry, particularly among QSRs. As a result, we may become subject to regulatory initiatives in the area of nutrition disclosure or advertising, such as requirements to provide information about the nutritional content of our food, which could increase our expenses. We may become subject to legislation or regulation seeking to tax and/or regulate high-fat foods. New or changing laws and regulations and governmental agency determinations relating to union organizing rights and activities may impact our operations and increase our cost of labor. If we fail to comply with existing or future regulations, we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions. In addition, our capital expenditures could increase due to remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any of these laws or regulations.\nAdverse media reports on our restaurant segment or brand, such as incidents involving food-borne illnesses, food tampering or other concerns, whether or not accurate, could damage our franchisors\u2019 brands and adversely affect consumer demand and our sales and profitability.\nAdverse media reports on our segment of the restaurant industry, such as pizza or hamburgers, or restaurants operating under a particular brand, can have an almost immediate and significant adverse impact on companies operating in that segment or restaurants using that brand, even though they have personally not engaged in the conduct being publicized. Such sensationalist media topics could include food borne illness, food contamination, unsanitary conditions or discriminatory behavior. Reports of food-borne illnesses (such as e-coli, mad cow disease, hepatitis A, trichinosis or salmonella) and injuries caused by food tampering have in the past severely injured the reputations of participants in the QSR segment and could in the future affect us as well. If such a situation was to arise, consumer demand for the food products we sell and our results of operations could be adversely affected, regardless of our lack of ownership of the relevant locations where the incidents may have occurred.\nOur systems may fail or be damaged, which could harm our operations and our business.\nOur operations are dependent upon the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our computer and information systems. Our systems could be exposed to damage or interruption from fire, natural disaster, power loss, telecommunications failure, unauthorized entry and computer viruses. System defects, failures, interruptions, unauthorized entries or viruses could result in:\n\u2022\nadditional development costs;\n\u2022\ndiversion of technical and other resources;\n\u2022\nloss of customers and sales;\n\u2022\nloss or theft of customer data;\n\u2022\nnegative publicity;\n\u2022\nharm to our business and reputation; and,\n\u2022\nexposure to litigation claims, government investigations and enforcement actions, fraud losses or other liabilities.\nTo the extent we rely on the systems of third parties in areas such as credit card processing, telecommunications and wireless networks, any defects, failures and interruptions in such systems could result in similar adverse effects on our business. Sustained or repeated system defects, failures or interruptions could materially impact our operations and operating results. Also, if we are unsuccessful in updating and expanding our systems, our ability to increase comparable store sales, improve operations, implement cost controls and grow our business may be constrained.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our infrastructure may be vulnerable to physical break-ins, computer viruses, programming errors, attacks by third parties or similar disruptive problems.\nWe are subject to cybersecurity risks, and if we suffer a security breach, we could damage our reputation with customers, incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation and government investigations and enforcement actions.\nOur business is dependent on the secure and reliable operation of our information systems, including those used to operate and manage our business, and to allow our customers to order online and through call centers. Security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of our information or that of our customers or employees, damage to our reputation, litigation, government investigations and enforcement actions and potential liability. We may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent rapidly evolving types of cyber attacks. Attacks may be targeted at us, our customers, or both. If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, customer and/or supplier perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose customers, suppliers or both. Actual or anticipated attacks and risks may have a material adverse effect on our financial results and cause us to incur increasing costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees, and engage third party experts and consultants.\nA person who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate our or our customers\u2019 and employees\u2019 confidential information, cause interruption in our operations, damage our computers or those of our customers, or otherwise damage our reputation and business. Any compromise of our security could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, and a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could harm our business and revenues. Any well-publicized compromise of either our security or the security of other Pizza Hut or Wendy\u2019s operators could deter people from conducting transactions that involve transmitting confidential information to our systems. Therefore, it is critical that our facilities and infrastructure remain secure and are perceived to be secure.\nAs do most retailers, we receive certain personal information about our customers. In addition, our online operations at www.pizzahut.com and mobile payment options at our Wendy\u2019s restaurants depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including information permitting cashless payments. Many of our customers use credit or debit cards to pay for their purchases. We rely on encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties to provide the security and authentication to effectively secure transmission of confidential information, including customer payment card numbers. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments may result in the technology used by us to protect transaction data being breached or compromised. Data breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues.\nUnder payment card rules and our contracts with our card processors, if there is a breach of payment card information that we store, we could be liable to the payment card issuing banks for their cost of issuing new cards and related expenses. In addition, if we fail to follow payment card industry security standards, even if there is no compromise of customer information, we could incur significant fines or lose our ability to give customers the option of using payment cards to pay for their orders. If we were unable to accept payment cards, our business would be seriously damaged.\nOur servers are also vulnerable to computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, and similar disruptions, including \u201cdenial-of-service\u201d type attacks. We may need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches or to address problems caused by breaches. Security breaches, including any breach by us or by persons with whom we have commercial relationships that result in the unauthorized release of our customers\u2019 or employees\u2019 personal information, could damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability.\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected by increased costs as a result of changes in laws relating to health care.\nThe federal government and several state governments have proposed or enacted legislation regarding health care, including legislation that in some cases requires employers to either provide health care coverage to their full-time employees, pay a penalty or pay into a fund that would provide coverage for them. We continue to evaluate the effects on our business of\nthe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which was signed into law on March 23, 2010, and the related Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, which was signed into law on March 30, 2010 (collectively, the \u201cFederal Health Care Acts\u201d). The provisions of the Federal Health Care Acts having the greatest potential financial impact on us became effective in 2015. While it does not appear that the incremental costs of these provisions will be material based upon our current evaluation, compliance with the Federal Health Care Acts will increase our future costs and could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nShortages or interruptions in the supply or delivery of food products could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe are dependent on frequent deliveries of food products that meet our specifications at competitive prices. Shortages or interruptions in the supply of food products caused by unanticipated demand, problems in production or distribution, disease or food-borne illnesses, inclement weather or other conditions could adversely affect the availability, quality and cost of ingredients, which would adversely affect our business. For our Pizza Hut units, we use one primary distributor to provide most all of our food and other supplies. If our distributor fails to meet its service requirements for any reason, it could lead to a material disruption of service or supply until a new distributor is engaged, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Likewise, all of our cheese for our Pizza Hut operations is purchased from a single supplier, the loss of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We are dependent on Leprino Foods Dairy Products Company (\u201cLeprino\u201d) as our sole supplier for cheese, one of our key ingredients. Leprino, one of the major pizza category suppliers of cheese in the United States, currently supplies all of our cheese. While we have no other sole sources of supply, we do source other key ingredients from a limited number of suppliers. Alternative sources of supply of cheese or other key ingredients may not be available on a timely basis or be available on terms as favorable to us as under our current arrangements.\nThe impact of potentially limited credit availability on third-party vendors such as our suppliers cannot be predicted. The inability of our suppliers to access financing, or the insolvency of suppliers, could lead to disruptions in our supply chain which could adversely impact our sales, cost of sales and financial condition.\nChanging health or dietary preferences may cause consumers to avoid products offered by us in favor of alternative foods.\nA significant portion of our sales is derived from products, including pizza and hamburgers, which can contain high levels of fat, carbohydrates, and sodium. The foodservice industry is affected by consumer preferences and perceptions. If prevailing health or dietary preferences and perceptions cause consumers to avoid pizza, hamburgers and other products we offer in favor of foods perceived to be healthier, demand for our products may be reduced and our business would be harmed. If PHI and Wendy\u2019s do not continually develop and successfully introduce new menu offerings that appeal to changing consumer preferences or if we do not timely capitalize on new products, our operating results will suffer.\nMoreover, because we are primarily dependent on two primary products, if consumer demand for pizza and hamburgers should decrease, our business would suffer more than if we had a more diversified menu, as many other food service businesses do.\nFailure to successfully implement our growth strategy could harm our business.\nOur growth strategy includes expanding our ownership and operation of Wendy's units through opportunistic acquisitions of restaurants in additional markets and organic growth through development of new restaurants that meet our investment objectives. In addition, we may continue to grow our business by opening and selectively acquiring Pizza Hut or other restaurants. We may not be able to achieve our growth objectives and these new restaurants may not be profitable. The opening and success of restaurants we may open or acquire in the future depends on various factors, including:\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain the necessary approvals from PHI or Wendy\u2019s;\n\u2022\nour ability to negotiate the acquisition of additional units from Wendy\u2019s or other Wendy's franchisees upon acceptable terms in desirable markets;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully operate the Wendy\u2019s brand and develop and implement the infrastructure necessary to manage new Wendy's units in new markets;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain or self-fund adequate development financing;\n\u2022\ncompetition from other QSRs in current and future markets;\n\u2022\nour degree of saturation in existing markets;\n\u2022\nthe identification and availability of suitable and economically viable locations;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully integrate acquired locations;\n\u2022\nsales and margin levels at existing restaurants;\n\u2022\nthe negotiation of acceptable lease or purchase terms for new locations;\n\u2022\npermitting and regulatory compliance;\n\u2022\nthe ability to meet construction schedules;\n\u2022\nour ability to hire and train qualified management and other personnel; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and business conditions.\nIn addition, the QSR pizza and hamburger market is mature with limited opportunity for unit growth. If we are unable to successfully implement our growth strategy, our revenue growth and profitability may be adversely affected.\nWe currently have limited experience operating Wendy's restaurants. In addition, some restaurants constructed or acquired in the future may be located in areas where we have little or no meaningful operating experience. Those markets may have different competitive conditions, consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns than our existing markets, which may cause our new restaurants to be less successful than restaurants in our existing markets or to incur losses. Restaurants opened in new markets may open at lower average weekly sales volumes than restaurants opened in existing markets, and may have higher restaurant-level operating expense ratios than in existing markets. Sales at restaurants opened in new markets may take longer to reach average unit volumes, if at all, thereby adversely affecting our operating results.\nLocal conditions, events, and natural disasters could adversely affect our business.\nCertain of the regions in which our units are located have been, and may in the future be, subject to adverse local conditions, events or natural disasters, such as earthquakes, hurricanes and tornadoes. Depending upon its magnitude, a natural disaster could severely damage our stores or call centers, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We currently maintain property and business interruption insurance through our aggregate property policy for each of our stores. However, in the event of a significant natural disaster or other cataclysmic occurrence, our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to offset all property damages and lost sales. In addition, upon the expiration of our current insurance policies, adequate coverage may not be available at economically justifiable rates, if at all.\nChanges in geographic concentration and demographic patterns may negatively impact our operations.\nThe success of any restaurant depends in substantial part on its location. There can be no assurance that our current locations will continue to be attractive as demographic patterns change. Neighborhood or economic conditions where restaurants are located could change in the future, thus resulting in potentially reduced sales in those locations.\nA significant number of our restaurants are located in the Midwest, South and Southeast and in non-metro and mid-metro areas. As a result, a severe or prolonged economic recession or changes in demographic mix, employment levels, population density, weather patterns, real estate market conditions or other factors unique to those geographic regions may adversely affect us more than some of our competitors that are located in other regions or in more urban areas.\nCounterparties to our revolving credit facility may not be able to fulfill their obligations due to disruptions in the global credit markets, which could adversely affect our liquidity.\nIn borrowing amounts under our revolving credit facility, we are dependent upon the ability of participating financial institutions to honor draws on the facility. Although we do not currently have amounts drawn on our revolving credit facility, we have utilized this facility in the past to fund acquisitions or working capital needs. The disruptions in the global credit markets may impede the ability of financial institutions syndicated under our revolving credit facility to fulfill their commitments, which could adversely affect our liquidity.\nWe could incur substantial losses if one of the third party depository institutions we use in our operations would happen to fail or if the money market funds in which we hold cash were to incur losses.\nAs part of our business operations, we maintain cash balances at third party depository institutions and in money market funds. The balances held in the money market funds are not insured or guaranteed by the FDIC or any other governmental agency. The balances held in third party depository institutions, to the extent in interest bearing accounts, may exceed the FDIC insurance limits. We could incur substantial losses if the underlying financial institutions fail or are otherwise unable to return our deposits or if the money market funds in which we hold cash were to incur losses.\nWe are subject to all of the risks associated with owning and leasing real estate, and any adverse developments could harm our results of operations and financial condition.\nAs of December 30, 2014, we owned the land and/or the building for 31 restaurants and leased the land and/or building for 1,389 restaurants. Accordingly, we are subject to all of the risks generally associated with owning and leasing real estate, including changes in the investment climate for real estate, demographic trends and supply or demand for the use of the restaurants, as well as potential liability for environmental contamination.\nThe majority of our existing lease terms for our Pizza Hut units end within the next two to six years and the next 15 to 20 years for our Wendy\u2019s units. We have the ability to exercise lease options to extend the terms at virtually all of these locations. If an existing or future store is not profitable, and we decide to close it, we may nonetheless be committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease including, among other things, paying the base rent for the balance of the lease term. Our obligation to continue making rental payments in respect of leases for closed restaurants could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, as each of our leases expires, we may be subject to increased rental costs or may fail to negotiate renewals, either on commercially acceptable terms or at all. If we are unable to renew our restaurant leases, we may be forced to close or relocate a restaurant, which could subject us to construction and other costs and risks, and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe depend on the services of key individuals, the loss of which could materially harm our business.\nOur success will depend, in part, on the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees most of whom have extensive experience with our company and in our industry. In addition, the market for qualified personnel is competitive and our future success will depend on our ability to attract and retain these personnel. We do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers, other than our chief executive officer, our chief financial officer and our senior vice president operations - Wendy's. Additionally, we do not maintain key-person insurance for any of our officers, employees or members of our Board of Directors. The loss of the services of any of our key employees or the failure to attract and retain employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by any claim or loss that is not covered by insurance or that exceeds our insurance coverage or self-insurance reserves.\nWe believe that we maintain insurance coverage that is customary for businesses of our size and type, including coverage for losses in excess of the normal expected levels under our self-insurance program. These insurance policies may not be adequate to protect us from liabilities that we incur in our business. In addition, in the future, our insurance premiums may increase and we may not be able to obtain similar levels of insurance on reasonable terms or at all. Moreover, there are types of losses we may incur that cannot be insured against or that we believe are not commercially reasonable to insure such as trade name restoration coverage associated with losses like food-borne illness and Avian flu. We do not currently have separate cyber-security insurance. Any inadequacy of insurance or inability to obtain insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, we self-insure a significant portion of expected losses under our workers\u2019 compensation, employee medical, general liability, auto and non-owned auto programs. Reserves are recorded based on our estimates of the ultimate costs to resolve or settle incurred claims, both reported and unreported. If our reserves were inadequate to cover costs associated with resolving or settling claims associated with these programs, or if a judgment substantially in excess of our insurance coverage is entered against us, our financial condition and cash flow could be adversely affected. Our non-owned auto program can experience significant volatility due to the potential for a combination of high severity accidents and our high retention levels, causing a potential negative impact on our results of operations.\nOur franchisors may not be able to adequately protect their intellectual property, which could harm the value of the Pizza Hut or Wendy\u2019s brand and branded products and adversely affect our business.\nThe success of our business depends on our continued ability to use our franchisors\u2019 existing trademarks, service marks and other components of the Pizza Hut and Wendy\u2019s brands in order to increase brand awareness and further develop our branded products. We have no control over the Pizza Hut or Wendy\u2019s brands. If our franchisors do not adequately protect their brands, our competitive position and operating results could be harmed.\nWe are not aware of any assertions that the trademarks or menu offerings we license from PHI or Wendy\u2019s infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties, but third parties may claim infringement by us in the future. Any such claim, whether or not it has merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, cause delays in introducing new menu items in the future\nor require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. As a result, any such claim could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nFailure by us to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) could harm our business and operating results and/or result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are required to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and effective internal control over financial reporting in connection with our filing of periodic reports with the SEC under the Exchange Act. Failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting or to comply with Section 404, or the report by us of a material weakness, may cause investors to lose confidence in our consolidated financial statements. If we fail to remedy any material weakness, our consolidated financial statements may be inaccurate and we may face restricted access to the capital markets.\nOur substantial leverage and lease obligations could affect our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate debt and restrict our future activities.\nWe are a highly leveraged company. Our total outstanding indebtedness on December 30, 2014 was $595.4 million, comprised of our term loan of $405.4 million (\"Term Loan\") and $190.0 million of Senior Notes. We can also borrow secured debt up to $110.0 million under our revolving credit facility (\u201cRevolving Facility\u201d). Our Term Loan, together with our Revolving Facility, are referred to herein as our \"Senior Secured Credit Facilities\". We had $19.1 million of letters of credit issued and outstanding, resulting in $90.9 million of borrowing capacity under our Revolving Facility on December 30, 2014. See Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Sources of Capital.\u201d\nWe also have, and will continue to have, significant lease obligations. As of December 30, 2014, our minimum annual rental obligations under long-term operating leases for fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2016 were $61.5 million and $55.4 million, respectively.\nOur high degree of leverage and significant lease obligations could have important consequences, including:\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, research and development, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes;\n\u2022\nrestricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who are less highly leveraged;\n\u2022\nexposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as the borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities will be at variable rates of interest;\n\u2022\nrequiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities.\nOur Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the indenture governing the Senior Notes contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. In addition, under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, we are required to satisfy and maintain specified amortizing financial ratios and other financial condition tests. Our ability to meet those financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control, and we may be unable to meet those ratios and tests. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. We have pledged a significant portion of our assets as collateral under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities. Any acceleration of amounts payable under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities would constitute a default under our Senior Notes. See Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Sources of Capital.\u201d\nFuture acquisitions, depending on the size, may require borrowings beyond those available on our Revolving Facility and therefore may require utilization of the additional term loan borrowing capacity under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities as well as other sources of debt or additional equity capital. Changes in the financial and credit markets may impair our ability to obtain additional debt financing at costs similar to that of our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, if at all. If we were to access\nadditional debt financing beyond our Senior Secured Credit Facilities to sustain our capital resource growth, additional financing could be at higher costs than the Company\u2019s currently outstanding borrowings. In addition any utilization of the remaining additional term loan borrowing capacity under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities could result in a reset of the interest rate on our term loan borrowings, which would increase our borrowing costs from current market conditions.\nWe are required to satisfy various financial covenants under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, and if we are unable to do so in the future we may be required to take corrective actions to avoid a default under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities and Senior Notes.\nWe were in compliance with the financial covenants under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities as of December 30, 2014, having a leverage ratio of 5.07x as compared to the covenant requirement of not more than 5.75x as of December 30, 2014 and an interest coverage ratio of 1.76x as compared to the covenant requirement of not less than 1.35x. The covenant requirement for the maximum leverage ratio decreases to not more than 5.50x for our 2015 fiscal year, not more than 5.0x for our 2016 fiscal year and not more than 4.75x thereafter. The covenant requirement for the minimum interest coverage ratio increases to not less than 1.40x after our 2015 fiscal year. Although we believe that we will be in compliance with these financial covenants for fiscal years 2015 and 2016 based upon our current operations and our internal financial forecasts, we may have less cushion in complying with the maximum leverage ratio in future periods than we have had in the past. Our ability to satisfy these financial covenants going forward will depend on our future operating performance, which is in part subject to Pizza Hut and Wendy\u2019s brand performance, prevailing economic and competitive conditions, including commodity prices, and various business, regulatory and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. If we are unable to satisfy these financial covenants in the future and are unable to cure any such failure under the terms of our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, we would be in default under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, with the consequences described above. See Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Sources of Capital.\u201d\nFederal, state and local environmental regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge, emission, release and disposal of hazardous materials could expose us to liabilities, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state and local environmental regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge, emission, release and disposal of hazardous materials. We own and lease numerous parcels of real estate on which our restaurants are located.\nFailure to comply with environmental laws could result in the imposition of penalties or restrictions on operations that could adversely affect our operations. Also, if contamination is discovered on properties owned or operated by us, including properties we owned or operated in the past, we could be held liable for damages and the costs of remediation. Such damages and costs could adversely affect our operations.", "PERMNO": 56630, "SIC": 5812, "TIC": "0738B"}
