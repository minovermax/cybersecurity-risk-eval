Any of the risks described below or elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or our other SEC filings may have a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nStrategic and Operational Risks\nWe face intense competition.\nThe grocery business is intensely competitive, and the recent and ongoing consolidation within the grocery industry is expected to result in increased competition, including from some competitors that have greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do. The grocery industry is characterized by relatively small operating margins, and as competition in certain areas intensifies and as the industry continues to consolidate, our results of operations may be negatively impacted through a loss of sales and reductions in gross margins. See \u201cBusiness-Competition\u201d for a discussion of the competitive environment.\nIf we are unable to appropriately respond to competition and execute on our initiatives to improve our competitive position or profitability, and differentiate our offerings, our sales, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe are transforming our business and have engaged, and may continue to engage in, acquisitions and divestitures and other strategic initiatives, and may encounter difficulties integrating acquired businesses or divesting businesses or assets and may not realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions and divestitures.\nWe have engaged in, and expect to continue to pursue, strategic transactions and initiatives as we transform our business. Acquisitions and dispositions present significant challenges and risks relating to the integration of acquired businesses and the separation of disposed businesses. The risks include: (i) our due diligence reviews may not identify all of the material issues; (ii) we may incur unanticipated costs or expenses; (iii) we may not be able to integrate acquisitions with our operations or separate divested businesses and related obligations from our operations as planned; and (iv) we may not be able to realize anticipated reductions in costs attributable to divested businesses or assets. In addition, we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits or synergies we anticipate when we first enter into a transaction. There can be no assurances that we will manage acquisitions and dispositions or other strategic initiatives successfully, that strategic opportunities will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all, or that we will be able to consummate desired transactions. Any of the foregoing could materially adversely affect our competitive position, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOn June 23, 2017, we acquired Unified, a retailer-owned cooperative focused on wholesale grocery and specialty distribution on the West Coast of the United States. On December 8, 2017, we acquired AG Florida, a retailer-owned cooperative that distributes full lines of grocery and general merchandise to independent retailers, located primarily in South Florida, the Caribbean, Central and South America and Asia. The process of integrating both Unified and AG Florida may be disruptive to our business operations and may distract our management team from their day-to-day responsibilities. There can also be no assurance that we will be able to successfully integrate Unified and AG Florida to achieve the operational efficiencies, including synergistic and other benefits of the acquisitions, to expand Unified\u2019s Market Centre division across the country or to effectively retain key employees and maintain and grow customer relationships.\nOn March 14, 2018, we announced our plan to exit our Farm Fresh banner and that we had entered into agreements to sell 21 of our 38 Farm Fresh stores. On April 24, 2018, we announced we are pursuing the sale of certain of our corporately owned and operated retail operations of Shop \u2018n Save and Shop \u2018n Save East. There can also be no assurance that we will be able to: (i) identify buyers for any or all of the remaining Farm Fresh stores on favorable terms or at all; (ii) consummate any strategic transactions for the Shop \u2019n Save and Shop \u2018n Save East banners held for sale and now reported within discontinued operations; (iii) effectively retain employees and continue to conduct business at these stores; and (iv) effectively reduce liabilities and stranded costs associated with discontinued operations, including any surplus property and management of remaining obligations under real estate leases.\nOn April 24, 2018, we announced agreements for a sale leaseback transaction for eight of our distribution centers, totaling approximately six million square feet with expected gross proceeds of approximately $483 before costs and taxes. The transactions are subject to customary closing conditions and there can be no assurance that we will not need to modify the terms of the transactions or that the transactions will close on a timely basis or at all.\nOur Wholesale distribution business could be adversely affected if we are not able to affiliate new customers, increase sales to existing customers or retain existing customers, or if our Wholesale customers fail to perform.\nThe profitability of our Wholesale segment is dependent upon sufficient volume to support our operating infrastructure, which is dependent on our ability to attract new customers, increase sales to existing customers and retain existing customers. The inability to attract new customers or the loss of existing customers to a competing wholesaler or due to closure, vertical integration by an existing customer converting to self-distribution, or industry consolidation may negatively impact our sales and operating margins.\nOur success also relies in part on the financial success and cooperation of our Wholesale customers. These Wholesale customers manage their businesses independently and, therefore, are responsible for the day-to-day operation of their stores. They may not experience an acceptable level of sales or profitability, and our revenues and gross margins could be negatively affected as a result. We may also need to extend credit to our Wholesale customers, including through loans, market support or guarantees, and while we seek to obtain security interests and other credit support in connection with the financial accommodations we extend, such collateral may not be sufficient to cover our exposure. If sales trends or profitability worsen for Wholesale customers, their financial results may deteriorate, which could result in, among other things, lost business for us, delayed or reduced payments to us or defaults on payments or other liabilities owed by Wholesale customers to us, any of which could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations, as well as our ability to grow our Wholesale business. In this regard, our Wholesale customers are affected by the same economic conditions, including food inflation and deflation, and competition that our Retail segment faces. The magnitude of these risks increases as the size of our Wholesale customers increases.\nOur inability to maintain or increase our operating margins could adversely affect our results of operations and the price of our stock.\nAs competition increases, the grocery industry consolidates and we attempt to affiliate larger Wholesale customers, we expect to continue to face pressure on our operating margins. If we are not able to continue to capture scale efficiencies and enhance our merchandise offerings, if we are not able to achieve our targeted synergies for our acquisitions of Unified and AG Florida or if we are not able to reduce our costs as we divest certain of our retail operations, we may not be able to achieve our goals with respect to operating margins. In addition, if we do not refine and improve our systems continually or if we are unable to effectively improve our systems without disruption including any migration to a cloud environment, we may not be able to reduce costs, increase sales and services, effectively manage inventory and procurement processes or effectively manage customer pricing plans. As a result, our operating margins may stagnate or decline, which could adversely affect the price of our stock.\nFailure to affiliate new customers and retain existing customers for our professional services, or the failure to perform the services as required, could adversely impact our results of operations.\nWe provide numerous services to our Wholesale customers to support the operation of their businesses and stores. We have been working to leverage our experience, infrastructure and investments to engage new customers and expand the scope of services received by existing customers. If we are unable to successfully implement this strategy, including differentiating the quality and breadth of our services to customers, in a highly competitive and consolidating environment, or if we are unable to perform the services up to the customers\u2019 expectations, our results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nWe have significant service relationships with Albertson\u2019s, NAI and Save-A-Lot, and the wind-down of our relationships with Albertson\u2019s and NAI (and any future wind down of Save-A-Lot) could adversely impact our results of operations.\nWe have provided significant support services to New Albertson\u2019s, Inc. (\u201cNAI\u201d) and Albertson\u2019s LLC (\u201cAlbertson\u2019s\u201d) since 2006 and to Save-A-Lot since we divested it in December 2016. We expect our services to NAI and Albertson\u2019s will end in September 2018, subject to limited extensions of services at NAI\u2019s and Albertson\u2019s election. We will lose a significant amount of revenue and corresponding operating earnings as a result of this wind down. We have been executing on our plan to reduce costs, grow our sales and enhance our margins over the past several years, but we do not believe that we will be able to grow sales quickly enough, further eliminate costs or enhance margins to fully mitigate the lost revenue as the TSA unwinds. Failure to execute on our services offering and growth strategy, including making the necessary capital investments for that growth while managing additional cost reductions, could further adversely impact our results of operations. We are working closely with NAI and Albertson\u2019s on the wind down but the execution of the wind down is dependent on NAI and Albertson\u2019s.\nWe are also expecting in fiscal 2019 to exit the distribution center that we share with NAI and Albertson\u2019s in Lancaster, PA. Our results of operations could be adversely impacted if we are not able to transition to our new distribution center in Harrisburg, PA in the manner and timeline anticipated.\nOur large professional services agreements, including our agreement with Save-A-Lot, provide certain rights for the customers. The services agreement will typically include a fixed term but provide the customer certain termination rights, including in the event of our material breach, and may give the customer certain termination and monetary rights with respect to specified services or service categories in the event we do not perform to agreed-upon minimum levels of service. The services agreement will also generally require us to indemnify the customer against third-party claims arising out of the performance of the services under the agreement. Termination of services agreements, in whole or in part, and in particular the services agreement with Save-A-Lot and the wind-down of the services agreement with NAI and Albertson\u2019s, could adversely affect our business or results of operations.\nWe may not be able to grow or maintain our levels of identical store sales.\nWe have experienced negative identical store sales in our Retail operations in certain recent periods. A variety of factors affect identical store sales and profitability, including in-store performance, consumer tastes, competition, current economic conditions, pricing, deflation or inflation, and weather conditions, and many of these factors are beyond our control and can be difficult to predict in advance. If our identical store sales continue to decline or fail to meet market expectations, our results of operations could be adversely affected and the price of our stock could decline.\nOur indebtedness could decrease our financial and operational flexibility and our borrowing costs could increase.\nOur credit facilities contain covenants that limit our ability to acquire assets, dispose of assets and use the proceeds thereof, create liens on property, incur or prepay indebtedness and pay dividends or repurchase stock, among other things and subject to certain exceptions. These covenants may affect our operating and financial flexibility and may require us to seek the consent of\nthe lenders for certain transactions that we may wish to effect. There can be no assurances that we would be able to obtain such consent on favorable terms or at all. There can also be no assurances that we will be able to refinance our existing indebtedness on similar terms. Tightening of credit, reduced liquidity or volatility in the capital markets could result in diminished availability of credit and higher costs of borrowing, making it more difficult for us to obtain or amend debt financing on favorable terms. Additionally, if we fail to comply with any of our covenants or other restrictions, the related indebtedness (and other unrelated indebtedness) could become due and payable prior to its stated maturity and we may not be able to repay the indebtedness that becomes due. A default under our debt instruments may also significantly affect our ability to obtain additional or alternative financing. A significant portion of our debt portfolio has a variable interest rate component. Volatility in interest rates causes volatility in interest expense, potentially resulting in an adverse impact to earnings.\nIncreases in healthcare, pension and other costs under Supervalu\u2019s and multiemployer benefit plans, or failure to maintain satisfactory labor relations, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe provide health, defined benefit pension, defined contribution and other postretirement benefits to many of our employees and the costs of such benefits continue to increase. The amount of any increase depends on a number of different factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include governmental regulations such as The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which has resulted in changes to the U.S. healthcare system and imposes mandatory types of coverage, reporting and other requirements; return on assets held in plans; changes in actuarial valuations, estimates, assumptions or calculations used to determine our benefit obligations for certain benefit plans, which require the use of significant estimates, including the discount rate, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, mortality rates and the rates of increase in compensation and healthcare costs; for multiemployer plans, the outcome of collective bargaining and actions taken by trustees who manage the plans; and potential changes to applicable legislation or regulation. If we are unable to control these benefits and costs, we may experience increased operating costs, which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, Company-sponsored plans and multiemployer pension plans are underfunded with the projected benefit obligations exceeding the fair value of those plans\u2019 assets. Withdrawal liabilities from multiemployer plans could be material, and potential exposure to withdrawal liabilities could cause us to forgo or negatively impact our ability to enter into other business opportunities. Some of these plans have required rehabilitation plans or funding improvement plans, and we can give no assurances of the extent to which a rehabilitation plan or a funding improvement plan will improve the funded status of the plan. We expect that increases of unfunded liabilities of these plans would result in increased future payments by us and the other participating employers over the next few years. A significant increase to funding requirements could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The financial condition of these pension plans may also negatively impact our debt ratings, which may increase the cost of borrowing or adversely affect our ability to access one or more financial markets.\nWe are party to collective bargaining agreements that impose certain work rules and other restrictions on us that limit our flexibility in managing our business, cost structure and business strategies. See \u201cBusiness-Employees\u201d for information about the collective bargaining agreements. There can be no assurance that we will be able to negotiate the terms of expiring or expired agreements in a manner acceptable to us. Therefore, potential increases in operating costs, reduced operational flexibility or work disruptions from labor disputes, strikes or picketing could disrupt our businesses and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Certain of our operations have employees who are non-union, and while we believe our employee relations are strong, there can be no assurance that these operations will not experience pressure from labor unions or become the target of campaigns to unionize.\nOur success depends in part on the retention of our executive officers and key management, and our ability to hire and retain key personnel.\nOur success depends on the experience, performance and skills of our executive officers, senior management and other key employees. Competition for skilled and experienced personnel is intense, and our future success will also depend on our ability to attract, incentivize and retain qualified personnel. Failure to attract, appropriately incentivize and retain qualified personnel could have an adverse effect on our operations. There can be no assurance that our executive succession planning, retention or hiring efforts will be successful.\nDisruptions to our or third-party information technology systems, including cyber-attacks and security breaches, and the costs of maintaining secure and effective information technology systems could negatively affect our business and results of operations.\nThe efficient operation of our businesses is highly dependent on computer hardware and software systems, including customized information technology systems. Additionally, our businesses increasingly involve the receipt, storage and transmission of sensitive data, including personal information about our customers and employees and our proprietary business\ninformation, customers and vendors. We also share information with vendors. Information systems are vulnerable to not functioning as designed and to disruptions and security breaches by computer hackers and cyber terrorists.\nIn fiscal 2015, we experienced separate criminal intrusions into the portion of our computer network that processes payment card transactions for some of our owned and franchised retail food stores, including some of the associated stand-alone liquor stores. We have incurred and expect to incur costs and expenses related to these intrusions, and may also be adversely affected by claims from customers, financial institutions, payment card brands, Albertson\u2019s and NAI for stores owned and operated by them that experienced related criminal intrusions, stockholders and others and by costly inquiries or enforcement actions on the part of regulatory authorities.\nAlthough we continue to take actions to strengthen the security of our information technology systems, these measures and technology may not adequately anticipate or prevent security breaches in the future or we may not be able to timely implement these measures and technology. Cyber-attacks are rapidly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated and difficult to detect. The failure to promptly detect, determine the extent of and appropriately respond to and contain a significant data security attack or breach of our systems or any third-party systems used by us could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We could also lose credibility with our customers and suffer damage to our reputation and future sales, including through negative publicity and social media. In addition, the unavailability of the information systems or failure of these systems or software to perform as anticipated for any reason and any inability to respond to, or recover from, such an event, could disrupt our business, impact our customers and could result in decreased performance, increased overhead costs and increased risk for liability, causing our business and results of operations to suffer.\nAs a merchant that accepts debit and credit cards for payment, we are subject to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (\u201cPCI DSS\u201d), issued by the PCI Council. Additionally, we are subject to PCI DSS as a service provider, which is a business entity that is not a payment brand directly involved in the processing, storage or transmission of cardholder data. PCI DSS contains compliance guidelines and standards with regard to our security surrounding the physical and electronic storage, processing and transmission of individual cardholder data. By accepting debit cards for payment, we are also subject to compliance with American National Standards Institute data encryption standards and payment network security operating guidelines. The cost of complying with stricter privacy and information security laws, standards and guidelines, including evolving PCI DSS standards, and developing, maintaining and upgrading technology systems to address future advances in technology, could be significant and we could experience problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology or with maintenance or adequate support of existing systems. Failure to comply with such laws, standards and guidelines, or payment card industry standards such as accepting Europay, MasterCard and Visa (EMV) transactions, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in the military commissary system or decreases in governmental funding could negatively impact the sales and operating performance of our military business.\nOur Wholesale segment sells and distributes grocery products to military commissaries and exchanges in the United States. The commissary system has experienced material changes as the Defense Commissary Agency has looked to reduce the level of governmental funding required for the system, including to lower prices from suppliers and to offer its own private-label products. The military food distribution industry already has narrow operating margins making economies of scale critical for distributors. These changes could have an adverse impact on the sales and operating performance of our military business. Additionally, our military business faces competition from large national and regional food distributors, as well as smaller food distributors, and the military commissaries and exchanges face competition from low-cost retailers.\nOur insurance and self-insurance programs may not be adequate to cover future claims.\nWe use a combination of insurance and self-insurance to provide for potential liabilities for workers\u2019 compensation, automobile and general liability, director and officer liability, property risk, cyber and privacy risks and employee healthcare benefits. We estimate the liabilities and required reserves associated with the risks we retain. Any such estimates and actuarial projection of losses is subject to a degree of variability. Among the causes of this variability are changes in benefit levels, medical fee schedules, medical utilization guidelines, vocation rehabilitation and apportionment and unpredictable external factors affecting inflation rates, discount rates, rising healthcare costs, litigation trends, legal interpretations, benefit level changes and actual claim settlement patterns. If the number or severity of claims for which we are self-insured increases, or we are required to accrue or pay additional amounts because the claims prove to be more severe than our original assessments, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nImpairment charges for long-lived assets or goodwill may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe monitor the recoverability of our long-lived assets, such as buildings and equipment, and evaluate their carrying value for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable. We annually review goodwill to determine if impairment has occurred. Additionally, interim reviews are performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. If the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred, we are required to record a non-cash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the long-lived assets or goodwill and the fair value of long-lived assets and the implied fair value of the goodwill, respectively, in the period the determination is made. The testing of long-lived assets and goodwill for impairment requires us to make estimates that are subject to significant assumptions about our future revenue, profitability, cash flows, fair value of assets and liabilities, weighted average cost of capital, as well as other assumptions. Changes in these estimates, or changes in actual performance compared with these estimates, may affect the fair value of long-lived assets or goodwill, which may result in an impairment charge.\nWe cannot accurately predict the amount or timing of any impairment of assets. Should the value of long-lived assets or goodwill become impaired, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nA potential proxy contest for the election of directors at our annual meeting could result in potential operational disruption, divert our resources and management\u2019s attention and have an adverse effect on our business.\nOn March 20, 2018, Blackwells Capital LLC nominated six candidates for election to our Board of Directors at our 2018 annual meeting of stockholders. A contested election could require us to incur substantial legal and public relations fees and proxy solicitation expenses and divert management\u2019s attention, and could result in potential operational disruption. Further, any perceived uncertainties as to our future direction and control could result in the loss of potential business opportunities and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified employees and customers, any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results. Any perceived uncertainties could also adversely affect the price and volatility of our stock.\nOur stock price is subject to market and other conditions and may be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors. These factors, some of which may be beyond our control, include the perceived prospects and actual operating results of our business; changes in estimates of our operating results by us, our analysts or investors; trading activity by our large stockholders; trading activity by sophisticated algorithms (high-frequency trading); our actual operating results relative to such estimates or expectations; actions or announcements by us or our competitors; litigation and judicial decisions; legislative or regulatory actions; and changes in general economic or market conditions. In addition, the stock market in general has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. These market fluctuations could reduce the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to our operating performance.\nEconomic Risks\nChanges in commodity prices, including due to deflation or inflation, or worsening economic conditions could adversely impact our financial condition and operating results.\nPrices for the commodities and supplies that we purchase can be volatile. We have recently experienced both deflation and inflation in commodities that we purchase for resale. Decreases in these input costs cause us to lower our prices and thereby reduce our revenues and gross margins. Continued deflation could adversely affect our operating results. Additionally, our operations are dependent on the availability of energy and fuel to store and transport products. While we have entered into contracts to purchase fuel, electricity and natural gas at fixed prices to satisfy a portion of our expected needs, an increase in these costs could adversely affect our results of operations. We have also invested in semitrailer trucks powered by compressed natural gas, which are subject to risks of defects, malfunctions and other damages.\nThe vast majority of our operations and customers are located in the United States, making our results highly dependent on U.S. economic conditions, including consumer confidence and spending habits. Further, a significant portion of our total sales for our Retail continuing operations is derived from stores located in Minnesota, North Dakota and the Washington D.C./Baltimore markets, resulting in further dependence on local economic conditions in these states. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify and respond effectively to changing economic conditions and trends. Additionally, these economic conditions can increase our cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses, and otherwise adversely affect our results of operations.\nSevere weather and natural disasters may harm our business.\nSevere weather conditions and natural disasters in areas in which we or our customers operate or from which we obtain products may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, including as a result of physical damage to our properties, closure of one or more of our or our customers\u2019 stores, offices or distribution facilities, lack of an adequate work force in a market, temporary disruption in the supply of products, disruption in the transport of goods, delays in the delivery of goods to distribution centers or stores, a reduction in customer volume and a reduction in the availability of products. In addition, adverse climate conditions and adverse weather patterns, such as drought or flood, that impact growing conditions and the quantity and quality of crops yielded by food producers may adversely affect the availability or cost of certain products within the grocery supply chain.\nDisruption to our supply chain and distribution network could have an adverse impact on our sales and results of operations.\nOur sales and operating results could be adversely impacted if we are not able to provide goods and services in a timely and cost-effective manner. Factors that may disrupt our ability to maintain an uninterrupted supply chain and distribution network include adverse climate conditions, product recalls, crop conditions, availability of key commodities, regulatory actions, disruptions in technology, political or financial instability of suppliers, performance by outsourced service providers, transportation interruptions, labor supply or stoppages or vendor defaults or disputes, as well as other risk factors mentioned herein, any of which could also have an adverse effect on our sales and operating results.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nOur businesses are subject to laws and governmental regulations that could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur businesses are subject to various federal, state and local laws, regulations and administrative practices that require us to comply with numerous provisions regulating areas such as environmental, health and sanitation standards, food safety, marketing of natural or organically produced food, facilities, pharmacies, equal employment opportunity, public accessibility, employee benefits, wages and hours worked and licensing for the sale of food, drugs, tobacco and alcoholic beverages, among others. For example:\nEnvironmental, Health and Safety: Our operations are subject to extensive and increasingly stringent laws and regulations pertaining to the protection of the environment, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, the disposal of food by-products, the handling, treatment and disposal of wastes, maintenance of refrigeration systems and remediation of soil and groundwater contamination. Compliance with existing or changing environmental and safety requirements, including more stringent limitations imposed or expected to be imposed in recently renewed or soon-to-be renewed environmental permits, may require capital expenditures.\nFood Safety: There is increasing governmental scrutiny, regulations and public awareness regarding food quality and food and drug safety. We may be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in the safety and quality of our food and drug products. Any events that give rise to actual or potential food contamination, drug contamination or food-borne illness or injury, or events that give rise to claims that our products are not of the quality or composition claimed to be, may result in product liability claims from individuals, consumers and governmental agencies, penalties and enforcement actions from government agencies, a loss of consumer confidence, harm to our reputation and could cause production and delivery disruptions, which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. It may be necessary for us to recall unsafe, contaminated or defective products or we may recall products that we determine do not satisfy our quality standards. Recall costs and product liability claims can be material. While we generally seek contractual indemnification and insurance coverage from our suppliers, we might not be able to recover these significant costs from our suppliers.\nPharmacy: We are required to meet various security and operating standards and comply with the Controlled Substances Act and its accompanying regulations governing the sale, marketing, packaging, holding, record keeping and distribution of controlled substances. During the past several years, the United States healthcare industry has been subject to an increase in governmental regulation and audits at both the federal and state levels. For example, see Note 16-Commitments, Contingencies and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the caption \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d for a discussion of the administrative subpoena issued to us by the DEA requesting, among other things, information on our pharmacy policies and procedures generally, as well as the production of documents that are required to be kept and maintained by us pursuant to the Controlled Substances Act and its implementing regulations. Additionally, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act made several significant changes to Medicaid rebates and to reimbursement. One of these changes was to revise the definition of the Average Manufacturer Price, a pricing element common to most payment formulas, and the reimbursement formula for multi-source (i.e., generic) drugs. This change will affect our reimbursement. In addition,\nthe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act made other changes that affect the coverage and plan designs that are or will be provided by many of our health plan clients, including the requirement for health insurers to meet a minimum medical loss ratio to avoid having to pay rebates to enrollees. These Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act changes may not affect our business directly, but they could indirectly impact our services and/or business practices.\nWage Rates and Paid Leave: Changes in federal or state minimum wage and overtime laws or employee paid leave laws could cause us to incur additional wage costs, which could adversely affect our operating margins.\nForeign Operations: Our supplier base includes domestic and foreign suppliers. In addition, we have customers located outside the United States and the acquisition of AG Florida expands our Wholesale business to additional international customers. Accordingly, political or financial instability in these foreign countries, changes in U.S. and foreign relationships, laws and regulations affecting the importation and taxation of goods, including duties, tariffs and quotas, or changes in the enforcement of those laws and regulations could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we are required to comply with laws and regulations governing export controls, and ethical, anti-bribery and similar business practices such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Additionally, foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an effect on our future costs or on future cash flows from our foreign operations, and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to comply with government laws and regulations or make capital expenditures required to maintain compliance with governmental laws and regulations may adversely impact our business operations and prospects for future growth and our ability to participate in federal and state healthcare programs and may also result in monetary liabilities, claims, fines, penalties or other sanctions and may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. We cannot predict the nature of future laws, regulations, interpretations or applications, nor can we determine the effect that additional governmental regulations or administrative orders, when and if promulgated, or disparate federal, state and local regulatory schemes would have on our future business.\nOur businesses may become subject to legal proceedings that may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur businesses are subject to the risk of legal proceedings by employees, unions, consumers, customers, suppliers, stockholders, debt holders, governmental agencies or others through private actions, class actions, administrative proceedings, regulatory actions or other litigation or proceeding. The outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits and regulatory actions, is difficult to assess or quantify. Plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek recovery of very large amounts, and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. The cost to defend future litigation may be significant. There may also be adverse publicity associated with litigation that may decrease consumer confidence in our businesses, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable. As a result, litigation may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. See also \u201cItem 3 Legal Proceedings\u201d below.\nEfforts to reduce pharmacy reimbursement levels and alter healthcare financing practices may adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe continued efforts of health maintenance organizations, managed care organizations, pharmacy benefit managers, government entities and other third-party payors to reduce prescription drug costs and pharmacy reimbursement rates may impact our profitability. The increase in preferred pharmacy networks has also had a negative impact on pharmacy reimbursement rates. Preferred pharmacy networks have lower reimbursements rates and associated performance fees that drive down profitability. Any inability to offset increased costs or to modify our activities to lessen the impact could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nChanges in tax laws and resulting regulations could result in changes to our tax provisions or benefits and subject us to additional tax liabilities or reduce the value of our tax attributes, which in either case could materially adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe are subject to income and other taxes. Changes in applicable tax laws and regulations, such as the December 2017 enactment of Federal legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201cTax Act\u201d), or their interpretation and application, including the possibility of retroactive effect and changes to state tax laws that may occur in response to the Tax Act, could affect our tax expense and profitability. In addition, the final determination of any tax audits or related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provision and accruals. Changes in our tax provision or benefit or an increase in our tax liability, whether due to changes in applicable laws and regulation, the interpretation or application thereof, or a final determination of tax audits or litigation, could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, which could harm our business.\nWe rely on a combination of trademark, service mark trade secret, copyright and domain name law and internal procedures and nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property. We believe our trademarks, private-label products and domain names are valuable assets. However, our intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to distinguish our products and services from those of our competitors and to provide us with a competitive advantage. From time to time, third parties may use names, logos and slogans similar to ours, may apply to register trademarks or domain names similar to ours, and may infringe or otherwise violate our intellectual property rights. Our intellectual property rights may not be successfully asserted against such third parties or may be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. Asserting or defending our intellectual property rights could be time consuming and costly and could distract management\u2019s attention and resources. If we are unable to prevent our competitors from using names, logos, slogans and domain names similar to ours, consumer confusion could result, the perception of our brands and products could be negatively affected, and our sales and profitability could suffer as a result.
