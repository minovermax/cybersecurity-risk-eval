RISK FACTORS\nThis section highlights the material risks that we currently face. Please be aware that these risks may change over time and other risks may prove to be important in the future. New risks may emerge at any time, and we cannot predict such risks or estimate the extent to which they may affect our business, financial condition or results of operations or the trading price of our securities.\nCompetition in the financial services industry may adversely affect our future earnings and growth.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment and our profitability and our future growth depends on our ability to compete successfully. We face pricing competition for loans and deposits and also with respect to customer convenience, product lines, accessibility of service and service capabilities. Certain of our competitors are larger and have more resources than we do, enabling them to be more aggressive than us in competing for loans and deposits and investing in new products, technology and services. In addition, the ability of non-bank competitors to provide services previously limited to commercial banks has intensified the competition we face. These non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations that govern us and, therefore, may be able to operate with greater flexibility and lower cost structures. This significant competition in attracting and retaining deposits and making loans as well as in providing other financial services may impact our future earnings and growth.\nWe may not realize the expected benefits from our efficiency and growth initiatives, which will negatively impact our future profitability.\nIn the current competitive banking environment, operating costs must continue to reduce or grow much slower than overall revenue growth. In addition, we must continue to implement strategies to grow our loan portfolio and increase non-interest income in order to realize continued earnings growth and to remain competitive with the other banks in the markets we serve. Since 2010, we have implemented a series of strategic efficiency and growth initiatives to address the challenges facing us and defined strategies for expense reduction, streamlining of processes and long-term growth initiatives. While we have realized cost-savings as a result of various expense savings initiatives, there is no guarantee that these initiatives will be successful in controlling expenses in the future as a number of factors can influence our levels of expenses, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, while expense management continues to be a major focus for us, management also expects to continue to make strategic investments in technology and talent that are expected to improve our customer experience and support future growth. There can be no assurance that we will ultimately realize the anticipated benefits of our expense reduction and growth strategies, which may impair our earnings growth.\nIn addition, we are is subject to various risks inherent in our business. These risks may cause the anticipated results from our growth strategies and cost-reduction initiatives to result in implementation charges beyond those currently contemplated or could result in some other unanticipated adverse impact. Furthermore, if we do not realize the anticipated cost-savings from our efficiency initiatives, we may need to take additional actions to achieve the desired cost-savings. The implementation of these initiatives may also have unintended impacts on our ability to attract and retain business and customers. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee that the anticipated long-term benefits from our efficiency and growth initiatives will be realized, and if they are not we may not achieve our strategic and financial objectives.\nIf our enterprise risk management framework is not effective at mitigating risk and loss to us, we could suffer unexpected losses and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nOur enterprise risk management framework seeks to achieve an appropriate balance between risk and return, which is critical to optimizing shareholder value. We have established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor, report and analyze the types of risk to which we are subject, including credit, liquidity, operational, regulatory compliance and reputational. However, as with any risk management framework, there are inherent limitations to our risk management strategies as there may exist, or develop in the future, risks that we have not appropriately anticipated or identified. For example, the financial and credit crisis and resulting regulatory reform highlighted both the importance and some of the limitations of managing unanticipated risks. If our risk management framework proves ineffective, we could suffer unexpected losses and our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nOur allowance for loan losses may not cover actual losses, and we may be required to materially increase our allowance, which may adversely affect our capital, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe derive the most significant portion of our revenues from our lending activities. When we lend money, commit to lend money or enter into a letter of credit or other contract with a counterparty, we incur credit risk, which is the risk of losses if our borrowers do not repay their loans or our counterparties fail to perform according to the terms of their contracts. We estimate and maintain an allowance for loan losses, which is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to expenses, which represents management's best estimate of probable credit losses that have been incurred within the existing portfolio of loans, as described under Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report and under \u201cCritical Accounting Policies - Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d under \u201cPart II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d of this Report. The allowance, in the judgment of management, is established to reserve for estimated loan losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses inherently\ninvolves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks using existing qualitative and quantitative information, all of which may undergo material changes. Changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans, risk ratings, and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses.\nBecause the risk rating of the loans is dependent on certain subjective information and is subject to changes in the borrower's credit risk profile, evolving local market conditions and other factors, it can be difficult for us to predict the effects that those factors will have on the classifications assigned to the loan portfolio, and thus difficult to anticipate the velocity or volume of the migration of loans through the classification process and effect on the level of the allowance for loan losses. Accordingly, we monitor our credit quality and our reserve requirements and use that as a basis for capital planning and other purposes. See \u201cPart II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity\u201d and \u201cPart II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Capital Resources\u201d of this Report for further information.\nFuture additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in the economic environment as well as changes in assumptions regarding a borrower's ability to pay and/or collateral values. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination procedures, periodically review the allowance. Based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination, such agencies may require us to recognize additions to the allowance or additional loan charge offs. An increase in the allowance for loan losses would result in a decrease in net income and capital, and could have a material adverse effect on our capital, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny future economic downturn could have a material adverse effect on our capital, financial condition, results of operations, and future growth.\nManagement continually monitors market conditions and economic factors throughout the footprint. If these conditions were to worsen, then we could see a sharp increase in our total net charge-offs and also be required to significantly increase our allowance for loan losses. Furthermore, the demand for loans and our other products and services could decline. An increase in our non-performing assets and related increases in our provision for loan losses, coupled with a potential decrease in the demand for loans and our other products and services, could negatively affect our business and could have a material adverse effect on our capital, financial condition, results of operations and future growth.\nOur net interest income could be negatively affected by the low level of short-term interest rates and a decrease in total loans.\nNet interest income, which is the difference between the interest income that we earn on interest-earning assets and the interest expense that we pay on interest-bearing liabilities, is a major component of our income and our primary source of revenue from our operations. The narrowing of interest rate spreads could adversely affect our earnings and financial condition. While we anticipate slight increases in interest rates in 2016, we expect rates to remain at historically low levels in 2016. Furthermore, we cannot control or predict with certainty changes in interest rates. Regional and local economic conditions, competitive pressures and the policies of regulatory authorities, including monetary policies of the FRB, affect interest income and interest expense. We have ongoing policies and procedures designed to manage the risks associated with changes in market interest rates. However, changes in interest rates still may have an adverse effect on our profitability. A significant portion of our loans, including commercial real estate loans and commercial and industrial loans, bear interest at variable rates. In addition, in order to compete for deposits in our primary market areas, we may offer more attractive interest rates to depositors, or we may have to pursue other sources of liquidity, such as wholesale funds. While we actively manage against these risks through hedging and other risk mitigation strategies, if our assumptions are wrong or overall economic conditions are significantly different than anticipated, our risk mitigation techniques may be insufficient.\nOur net interest income was $827.3 million for 2015, an increase of 1.0% compared to $819.3 million for 2014. Our total loans were $22.43 billion as of December 31, 2015 compared to $21.10 billion as of December 31, 2014. Any future decrease in loan yields or lower realized yields on investment securities could reduce our net interest income and could cause additional pressure on net interest income in future periods. This reduction in net interest income also may be exacerbated by the high level of competition that we face in our primary market area. Significant reduction in our net interest income could have a material adverse impact on our capital, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe financial services market is undergoing rapid technological changes, and if we are unable to stay current with those changes, we will not be able to effectively compete.\nThe financial services market, including banking services, is undergoing rapid changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to keep pace with the technological changes and to use technology to satisfy and grow customer demand for our products and services and to create additional efficiencies in our operations. We expect that we will need to make substantial investments in our technology and information systems to compete effectively and to stay current with technological changes. Some of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements and will be able to invest more heavily in developing and adopting new\ntechnologies, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. As a result, our ability to effectively compete to retain or acquire new business may be impaired, and our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe rely extensively on information technology systems to operate our business and an interruption or security breach may disrupt our business operations, result in reputational harm and have an adverse effect on our operations.\nAs a large financial institution, we rely extensively on our information technology systems to operate our business, including to process, record and monitor a large number of customer transactions on a continuous basis. As customer, public and regulatory expectations regarding operational and information security have increased, our operational systems and infrastructure must continue to be safeguarded and monitored for potential failures, disruptions and breakdowns. Our business, financial, accounting, data processing systems or other operating systems and facilities may stop operating properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control. For example, there could be sudden increases in customer transaction volume; electrical or telecommunications outages; natural disasters such as earthquakes, tornadoes, and hurricanes; disease pandemics; events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters, including terrorist acts; and, as described below, cyber-attacks.\nWe have policies, procedures and systems designed to prevent or limit the effect of possible failures, interruptions or breaches in security of information systems and business continuity programs designed to provide services in the case of an event resulting in material disruptions of our operating systems. We regularly seek to test the effectiveness of and enhance these policies, procedures and systems. However, there is no guarantee that these safeguards or programs will address all of the threats that continue to evolve. The occurrence of any failure, interruption or security breach of any of our operating systems, or the systems of other companies on which we rely, could result in a wide variety of adverse consequences to us, including disruptions to our business operations, damage to our reputation, loss of customers, liabilities to us and increased regulatory scrutiny.\nWe face significant cyber and data security risk that could result in the disclosure of confidential information, adversely affect our business or reputation and expose us to significant liabilities.\nAs a large financial institution, we are under continuous threat of loss due to the velocity and sophistication of cyber-attacks. This risk continues to increase. Two of the most significant cyber-attack risks that we face are e-fraud and loss of sensitive customer data. Loss from e-fraud occurs when cybercriminals breach and extract funds directly from customer or our accounts. The attempts to breach sensitive customer data, such as account numbers and social security numbers, would present significant reputational, legal and/or regulatory costs to us if successful. Our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of the evolving nature and complexity of these threats from cybercriminals and hackers, our plans to continue to provide internet banking and mobile banking channels, and our plans to develop additional remote connectivity solutions to serve our customers. While we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches to date, we have been the subject of attempted hacking and cyber-attacks and there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future.\nThe occurrence of any cyber-attack or information security breach could result in material adverse consequences to us including damage to our reputation and the loss of customers. We also could face litigation or additional regulatory scrutiny. Litigation or regulatory actions in turn could lead to significant liability or other sanctions, including fines and penalties or reimbursement to customers adversely affected by a security breach. Even if we do not suffer any material adverse consequences as a result of events affecting us directly, successful attacks or systems failures at other large financial institutions could lead to a general loss of customer confidence in financial institutions including us.\nWe continually review the security of our IT systems and make the necessary investments to improve the resiliency of our systems and their security from attack. Nonetheless, there remains the risk that we may be materially harmed by a cyber-attack or information security breach. Attack methods continue to evolve in sophistication, velocity, and frequency and can occur from a variety of sources, such as foreign governments, hacktivists, or other well-financed entities, and may originate from less regulated and remote areas of the world. As a result, if such an attack or breach does occur, we will take reasonable and customary measures to address the situation, based on our crisis management plan.\nWe rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure.\nThird parties provide key components of our business operations such as data processing, recording and monitoring transactions, online banking interfaces and services, Internet connections and network access. While we have selected these third-party vendors carefully, we do not control their actions. Any problems caused by these third parties, including those resulting from disruptions in communication services provided by a vendor, failure of a vendor to handle current or higher volumes, cyber-attacks and security breaches at a vendor, failure of a vendor to provide services for any reason or poor performance of services, could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and otherwise conduct our business. Financial or operational difficulties of a third-party vendor could also hurt our operations if those difficulties interfere with the vendor's\nability to serve us. Furthermore, our vendors could also be sources of operational and information security risk to us, including from breakdowns or failures of their own systems or capacity constraints. Replacing these third-party vendors could also create significant delay and expense. Accordingly, use of such third parties creates an unavoidable inherent risk to our business operations.\nWe may not be able to attract and retain key employees, which may adversely impact our ability to successfully execute our growth strategies.\nOur financial success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly motivated, well-qualified personnel. We face significant competition in the recruitment of qualified employees from financial institutions and others. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified employees, our ability to execute our business strategies may suffer and we may be required to substantially increase our overall compensation or benefits to attract and retain such employees. Furthermore, in June 2010, the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Office of Thrift Supervision, and the FDIC jointly issued comprehensive final guidance designed to ensure that incentive compensation policies do not undermine the safety and soundness of banking organizations by encouraging employees to take imprudent risks. This regulation significantly restricts the amount, form, and context in which we pay incentive compensation and may put us at a competitive disadvantage compared to non-financial institutions in terms of attracting and retaining senior level employees.\nWe could realize losses if we determine to sell non-performing assets and the proceeds we receive are lower than the carrying value of such assets.\nWe could realize future losses if the proceeds we receive upon dispositions of non-performing assets are lower than the recorded carrying value of such assets, which could adversely affect our results of operations in future periods. Accordingly, we could realize an increased level of credit costs in any period during which we determine to dispose of an increased level of distressed assets. Further, although market conditions have improved, if market conditions experience another downturn, this could negatively impact our ability to dispose of distressed assets, and may result in higher credit losses on sales of distressed assets.\nWe are subject to a variety of operational risks, including reputational risk, legal risk, and regulatory and compliance risk, and the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders, which may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe are exposed to many types of operational risks, including reputational risk, legal and regulatory and compliance risk, the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders, including unauthorized transactions by employees or operational errors, clerical or record-keeping errors or those resulting from faulty or disabled computer or telecommunications systems. See \u201cPart I - Item 1. Business - Enterprise Risk Management\u201d of this Report for further information. Negative public opinion may result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including lending practices, corporate governance and acquisitions and from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities. Negative public opinion may adversely affect our ability to attract and keep customers and can expose us to litigation and regulatory action. Actual or alleged conduct by us may result in negative public opinion about our business. Negative public opinion may also affect our credit ratings, which are important to our access to unsecured wholesale borrowings.\nOur business involves storing and processing sensitive consumer and business customer data. If personal, non-public, confidential or proprietary information of customers in our possession were to be mishandled or misused, we may suffer significant regulatory consequences, reputational damage and financial loss. Such mishandling or misuse could include, for example, if such information were erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information, either by fault of our systems, employees, or counterparties, or where such information is intercepted or otherwise inappropriately taken by third parties. Furthermore, a cyber security breach could result in theft of such data.\nBecause the nature of the financial services business involves a high volume of transactions, certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and successfully rectified. Our necessary dependence upon automated systems to record and process transactions, and our large transaction volume may further increase the risk that technical flaws or employee tampering or manipulation of those systems will result in losses that are difficult to detect. We also may be subject to disruptions of our operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond our control (for example, computer viruses, cyber-attacks or electrical or telecommunications outages, or natural disasters, disease pandemics or other damage to property or physical assets) which may give rise to disruption of service to customers and to financial loss or liability. We are further exposed to the risk that our external vendors may be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations (or will be subject to the same risk of fraud or operational errors by their respective employees as we are) and to the risk that our (or our vendors') business continuity and data security systems prove to be inadequate. The occurrence of any of these risks may result in a diminished ability of us to operate our business (for example, by requiring us to expend significant resources to correct the defect), as well as potential liability to clients, reputational damage and regulatory intervention, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, perhaps materially.\nAs an issuer of credit and debit cards we are exposed to losses in the event that holders of our cards experience fraud on their card accounts.\nOur customers regularly use Synovus-issued credit and debit cards to pay for transactions with retailers and other businesses. There is the risk of data security breaches at these retailers and other businesses that could result in the misappropriation of our customers\u2019 credit and debit card information. When our customers use Synovus-issued cards to make purchases from those businesses, card account information is provided to the business. If the business\u2019s systems that process or store card account information are subject to a data security breach, holders of our cards who have made purchases from that business may experience fraud on their card accounts. We may suffer losses associated with reimbursing our customers for such fraudulent transactions on customers\u2019 card accounts, as well as for other costs related to data security compromise events, such as replacing cards associated with compromised card accounts. In addition, we provide card transaction processing services to some merchant customers under agreements we have with payment networks such as Visa and MasterCard. Under these agreements, we may be responsible for certain losses and penalties if one of our merchant customers suffers a data security breach.\nIn the last three years, a number of large retailers suffered substantial data security breaches compromising millions of credit and debit card accounts. To date, our losses and costs related to these breaches have not been material, but other similar events in the future could be more significant to us.\nIf we pursue acquisitions in the future as part of our growth strategy, we may not be able to complete such acquisitions or successfully integrate bank or nonbank acquisitions into our existing operations.\nWhile we have historically grown by acquisition, we have not completed any acquisitions since the economic downturn. As we have returned to profitability, we may pursue acquisitions of bank or non-bank operations as a growth strategy. However, we may not be successful in identifying suitable acquisition candidates, and even if we identify such candidates, we may not be successful in completing such acquisitions on favorable terms, if at all.\nIn particular, difficulties may arise in the integration of the business and operations of BHCs, banks and other non-bank entities we acquire and, as a result, we may not be able to achieve the cost savings and synergies that we expect will result from such transactions. Achieving cost savings is dependent on consolidating certain operational and functional areas, eliminating duplicative positions and terminating certain agreements for outside services. Additional savings are dependent upon the integration of the acquired entity\u2019s businesses with our businesses, the conversion of core operating systems, data systems and products and the standardization of business practices. The integration could result in higher than expected deposit attrition, loss of key employees, disruption of our businesses or the businesses of the acquired company, or otherwise adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees or achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition.\nIn addition, we must generally satisfy a number of meaningful conditions before we can complete an acquisition of another bank or BHC, including federal and/or state regulatory approvals. Also, under the Dodd-Frank Act, U.S. regulators must now take systemic risk into account when evaluating whether to approve a potential acquisition transaction. We cannot be certain when or if, or on what terms and conditions, any required regulatory approvals will be granted.\nThe fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies could have a material adverse effect on our earnings.\nThe Federal Reserve Board regulates the supply of money and credit in the U.S. Its policies determine in large part the cost of funds for lending and investing and the return earned on those loans and investments, both of which affect our net interest margin. They can also materially decrease the value of financial assets we hold. Federal Reserve policies may also adversely affect borrowers, potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans, or could adversely create asset bubbles which result from prolonged periods of accommodative policy. This, in turn, may result in volatile markets and rapidly declining collateral values. Changes in Federal Reserve policies are beyond our control and difficult to predict; consequently, the impact of these changes on our activities and results of operations is difficult to predict. Also, potential new taxes on corporations generally, or on financial institutions specifically, would adversely affect our net income.\nWe may become subject to supervisory actions and enhanced regulation that could have a material negative effect on our business, reputation, operating flexibility, financial condition and the value of our common stock and preferred stock.\nUnder federal and state laws and regulations pertaining to the safety and soundness of insured depository institutions, state banking regulators, the Federal Reserve, and separately the FDIC as the insurer of bank deposits, each has the authority to compel or restrict certain actions on our part if any of them determine that we have insufficient capital or are otherwise operating in a manner that may be deemed to be inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices. In addition to examinations for safety and soundness, we and our subsidiaries also are subject to continuous examination by state and federal banking regulators, including the CFPB, for compliance with various laws and regulations, as well as consumer compliance initiatives. As a result of this regulatory oversight and examination process, our regulators may require us to enter into informal or formal supervisory agreements, including board resolutions, memoranda of understanding, written agreements and consent or cease and desist orders, pursuant to which we could be required to take identified corrective actions to address cited concerns, or to refrain from taking certain actions.\nIf we become subject to and are unable to comply with the terms of any future regulatory actions or directives, supervisory agreements, or orders, then we could become subject to additional, heightened supervisory actions and orders, possibly including consent orders, prompt corrective action restrictions and/or other regulatory actions, including prohibitions on the payment of dividends on our common stock and Series C Preferred Stock. If our regulators were to take such additional supervisory actions, then we could, among other things, become subject to significant restrictions on our ability to develop any new business, as well as restrictions on our existing business, and we could be required to raise additional capital, discontinue our share repurchase program, dispose of certain assets and liabilities within a prescribed period of time, or all of the above. The terms of any such supervisory action could have a material negative effect on our business, reputation, operating flexibility, financial condition and the value of our common stock. See \u201cPart I - Item 1. Business - Supervision, Regulation, and Other Factors\u201d in this Report for further information\nRegulation of the financial services industry continues to undergo major changes, and future legislation could increase our cost of doing business or harm our competitive position.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act brought about a significant overhaul of many aspects of the regulation of the financial services industry, addressing, among other things, systemic risk, capital adequacy, deposit insurance assessments, consumer financial protection, interchange fees, derivatives, lending limits, mortgage lending practices, registration of investment advisors and changes among the bank regulatory agencies. Key provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that have impacted or are likely to impact the operations of Synovus Bank or Synovus include:\n\u2022\nCreation of the CFPB with centralized authority, including examination and enforcement authority, for consumer protection in the banking industry.\n\u2022\nNew limitations on federal preemption.\n\u2022\nNew prohibitions and restrictions on the ability of a banking entity and nonbank financial company to engage in proprietary trading and have certain interests in, or relationships with, a hedge fund or private equity fund (the \u201cVolcker Rule\u201d).\n\u2022\nApplication of new regulatory capital requirements, including changes to leverage and risk-based capital standards and changes to the components of permissible tiered capital.\n\u2022\nRequirement that the company and its subsidiary bank be well capitalized and well managed in order to engage in activities permitted for financial holding companies.\n\u2022\nChanges to the assessment base for deposit insurance premiums.\n\u2022\nPermanently raising the FDIC's standard maximum deposit insurance amount to a $250,000 limit for federal deposit insurance.\n\u2022\nRepeal of the prohibition on the payment of interest on demand deposits, thereby permitting depository institutions to pay interest on business transaction and other accounts.\n\u2022\nRestrictions on compensation, including a prohibition on incentive-based compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risk taking by covered financial institutions and are deemed to be excessive, or that may lead to material losses.\n\u2022\nRequirement that sponsors of asset-backed securities retain a percentage of the credit risk of the assets underlying the securities.\n\u2022\nRequirement that banking regulators remove references to and requirements of reliance upon credit ratings from their regulations and replace them with appropriate alternatives for evaluating credit worthiness.\n\u2022\nRules pertaining to a mortgage borrower\u2019s ability to repay, mortgage loan originator compensation and qualifications, and integrated mortgage disclosure rules that will replace and combine certain existing requirements under the Truth in Lending Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, among other requirements affecting the mortgage origination and secondary marketing of mortgages.\nSome of these and other major changes could materially impact the profitability of our business, the value of assets we hold or the collateral available for our loans, require changes to business practices or force us to discontinue businesses and expose us to additional costs, taxes, liabilities, enforcement actions and reputational risk. Many of these provisions became effective upon enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, while others were subject to further study, rulemaking, and the discretion of regulatory bodies and have only recently taken effect or will take effect in coming years. In light of these significant changes and the discretion afforded to federal regulators, we cannot fully predict the effect that compliance with the Dodd-Frank Act or any implementing regulations will have on our businesses or our ability to pursue future business opportunities. Additional regulations resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nCertain other reform proposals have resulted in us becoming subject to stricter capital requirements and leverage limits, and affect the scope, coverage, or calculation of capital, all of which could require us to reduce business levels or to raise capital, including in ways that may adversely impact our shareholders or creditors. See \u201cPart I - Item 1. Business - Supervision, Regulation\nand Other Factors\u201d of this Report for further information. We cannot predict whether new legislation will be enacted and, if enacted, the effect that it, or any regulations, would have on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWe may be required to undertake additional strategic initiatives to improve our capital position due to changes in economic conditions or changes in regulatory capital rules.\nEffective January 1, 2015, the regulatory capital framework changed for us in important respects as a result of the new rules implementing the Dodd-Frank Act and a separate, international regulatory capital initiative known as \u201cBasel III\u201d (collectively, the \u201cBasel III Capital Rules\u201d). Among other things, the Basel III Capital Rules raised the minimum thresholds for required capital and revised certain aspects of the definitions and elements of the capital that can be used to satisfy these required minimum thresholds. The Basel III Capital Rules also introduced a minimum \u201ccapital conservation buffer\u201d equal to 2.5% of an organization\u2019s total risk-weighted assets, which exists in addition to the required minimum CET1, Tier 1 and Total Capital ratios identified above. The \u201ccapital conservation buffer,\u201d which must consist entirely of CET1, is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. The implementation of the capital conservation buffer began on January 1, 2016 at the 0.625% level and will be phased-in over a three-year period (increasing by that amount on each subsequent January 1, until it reaches 2.5% on January 1, 2019). In October 2015, we implemented a new capital plan designed to return capital to our shareholders, including the repurchase of up to $300 million of capital stock and an increase in the quarterly dividend payable to holders of our common stock. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2015, we issued $250 million in subordinated debt and repurchased $46.7 million of our outstanding subordinated notes that mature in 2017. As a result and as of December 31, 2015, our CET1 ratio under Basel III was 9.77% on a fully phased-in basis, which is in excess of the minimum common equity and additional conservation buffer stipulated by the Basel III Capital Rules. See \"Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Capital Resources\" and \"Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" of this Report for further information.\nWe and Synovus Bank are also subject to stress testing requirements, including public disclosures of certain results. The results of such stress testing may require us to take certain actions to improve our capital position. See \u201cPart I - Item 1. Business - Supervision, Regulation and Other Factors\u201d of this Report for further information.\nMoreover, the federal bank regulators have issued a series of guidance and rulemakings applicable to large banks. While many of these do not currently apply to us due to our asset size, these issuances could impact industry capital standards and practices in many potentially unforeseeable ways.\nWe continue to actively monitor economic conditions, evolving industry capital standards, and changes in regulatory standards and requirements, and engage in regular discussions with our regulators regarding capital at both Synovus and Synovus Bank. As part of our ongoing management of capital, we will continue to identify, consider, and pursue additional strategic initiatives to bolster our capital position as deemed necessary, including strategies that may be required to meet the requirements of Basel III and other regulatory initiatives regarding capital, and will continue to evaluate our share repurchase program and increased dividends. The need to maintain more capital and greater liquidity than has been required historically could limit our business activities, including lending, and our ability to expand, either organically or through future acquisitions. It could also result in us taking steps to increase our capital that may be dilutive to shareholders or limit our ability to pay dividends or otherwise return capital to shareholders.\nChanges in the cost and availability of funding due to changes in the deposit market and credit market, or the way in which we are perceived in such markets, may adversely affect our capital resources, liquidity and financial results.\nWe may be unable to access historical and alternative sources of liquidity, including the capital markets, brokered deposits, and borrowings from the FHLB, which could adversely affect our overall liquidity. Liquidity represents the extent to which we have readily available sources of funding needed to meet the needs of our depositors, borrowers and creditors, to support asset growth, and to otherwise sustain our operations and the operations of our subsidiary bank. In managing our consolidated balance sheet, we depend on access to a variety of sources of funding to provide us with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet our commitments and business needs, and to accommodate the transaction and cash management needs of our customers. Sources of funding available to us, and upon which we rely as regular components of our liquidity and funding management strategy, include borrowings from the FHLB and brokered deposits. See \u201cPart II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity\u201d and \u201cPart II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Capital Resources\u201d of this Report for further information. We also have historically enjoyed a solid reputation in the capital markets and have been able to raise funds in the form of either short- or long-term borrowings or equity or debt issuances. If, due to market disruptions, perceptions about our credit ratings or other factors, we are unable to access the capital markets in the future, our capital resources and liquidity may be adversely affected.\nIn general, the amount, type and cost of our funding, including from other financial institutions, the capital markets and deposits, directly impacts our costs in operating our business and growing our assets and can therefore positively or negatively affect our financial results. A number of factors could make funding more difficult, more expensive or unavailable on any terms, including, but not limited to, a downgrade in our credit ratings, financial results, changes within our organization, specific events\nthat adversely impact our reputation, disruptions in the capital markets, specific events that adversely impact the financial services industry, counterparty availability, changes affecting our assets, the corporate and regulatory structure, interest rate fluctuations, general economic conditions and the legal, regulatory, accounting and tax environments governing our funding transactions. Also, we compete for funding with other banks and similar companies, many of which are substantially larger, and have more capital and other resources than we do. In addition, as some of these competitors consolidate with other financial institutions, these advantages may increase. Competition from these institutions may increase the cost of funds.\nIn addition to bank level liquidity management, we must manage liquidity at the Parent Company for various needs including potential capital infusions into subsidiaries, the servicing of debt, the payment of dividends on our common stock and preferred stock and share repurchases. The primary source of liquidity for us consists of dividends from Synovus Bank which is governed by certain rules and regulations of our supervising agencies. During 2014, Synovus Bank made upstream cash distributions to the Parent Company totaling $182.0 million including cash dividends of $90.6 million. During 2015, Synovus Bank made upstream cash distributions to the Parent Company totaling $225.0 million including cash dividends of $199.9 million. On February 12, 2016, Synovus Bank paid an upstream cash dividend of $100.0 million to the Parent Company. Synovus' ability to receive dividends from Synovus Bank in future periods will depend on a number of factors, including, without limitation, Synovus Bank's future profits, asset quality, liquidity and overall condition. In addition, GA DBF rules and related statutes contain additional restrictions on payments of dividends by Synovus Bank. In particular, the Georgia Financial Institutions Code contains restrictions on the ability of a Georgia bank to pay dividends other than from retained earnings and under other circumstances without the approval of the GA DBF. As a result of these restrictions, Synovus Bank may be required to seek approval from the GA DBF to pay dividends. See \u201cPart I - Item 1A. Risk Factors - We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our debt and repay maturing debt obligations.\u201d of this Report. See \"Part I - Item 1. Business - Supervision, Regulatory and Other Factors - Dividends\" of this Report for further information. Synovus expects that it will receive additional dividends from Synovus Bank in 2016. If Synovus does not receive dividends from Synovus Bank in 2016 at the levels anticipated, its liquidity could be adversely affected and it may not be able to continue to execute its current capital plan to return capital to its shareholders. In addition to dividends from Synovus Bank, we have historically had access to a number of alternative sources of liquidity, including the capital markets, but there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain such liquidity on terms that are favorable to us, or at all. If our access to these traditional and alternative sources of liquidity is diminished or only available on unfavorable terms, then our overall liquidity and financial condition will be adversely affected.\nFurther downgrades of U.S. government securities by one or more of the credit ratings agencies could have a material effect on our operations, earnings, and financial condition.\nIn 2011, the S&P credit rating agency lowered its long term sovereign credit rating on the United States from AAA to AA+, which reflected S&P's view that an August 2011 agreement of U.S. lawmakers regarding the debt ceiling fell short of what would be necessary to stabilize the U.S. government's medium term debt dynamics. In June 2013, S&P reaffirmed that rating, while raising its outlook from \"Negative\" to \"Stable\". The three other major credit rating agencies did not downgrade their previously issued U.S. sovereign credit ratings, though some have issued negative outlooks at various times over the last several years. While the risk of a sovereign credit ratings downgrade of the U.S. government, including the rating of U.S. Treasury securities, has been reduced, the possibility still remains. It is foreseeable that the ratings and perceived creditworthiness of instruments issued, insured or guaranteed by institutions or agencies directly linked to the U.S. government could also be correspondingly affected by any such downgrade. Instruments of this nature are key assets on the balance sheets of financial institutions to meet their day-to-day cash flow needs in the short-term debt market.\nA possible future downgrade of the sovereign credit ratings of the U.S. government and a decline in the perceived creditworthiness of U.S. government-related obligations could impact our ability to obtain funding that is collateralized by affected instruments, as well as affect the pricing of that funding when it is available. A downgrade may also adversely affect the market value of such instruments. We cannot predict if, when or how any changes to the credit ratings or perceived creditworthiness of these organizations will affect economic conditions. Such ratings actions could result in a significant adverse impact on us. A downgrade of the sovereign credit ratings of the U.S. government or the credit ratings of related institutions, agencies, or instruments could exacerbate the other risks to which we are subject and any related adverse effects on the business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf Synovus Bank is unable to grow its deposits, it may be subject to paying higher funding costs.\nThe total amount that we pay for funding costs is dependent, in part, on Synovus Bank\u2019s ability to grow its deposits. If Synovus Bank is unable to sufficiently grow its deposits to meet liquidity needs, it may be subject to paying higher funding costs to meet these liquidity needs. Synovus Bank competes with banks and other financial services companies for deposits. If competitors raise the rates they pay on deposits, Synovus Bank\u2019s funding costs may increase, either because Synovus Bank raises rates to avoid losing deposits or because Synovus Bank loses deposits and must rely on more expensive sources of funding. Higher funding costs reduce our net interest margin and net interest income. Synovus Bank\u2019s customers could take their money out of the bank and put it in alternative investments, causing Synovus Bank to lose a lower cost source of funding. Checking and savings account\nbalances and other forms of customer deposits may decrease when customers perceive alternative investments, such as the stock market, as providing a better risk/return tradeoff.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our debt and repay maturing debt obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we and our consolidated subsidiaries had $2.19 billion of long-term debt outstanding. Our ability to make scheduled payments of principal and interest or to satisfy our obligations in respect of our debt, to refinance our debt or to fund capital expenditures will depend on our future financial and operating performance and our ability to maintain adequate liquidity. Prevailing economic conditions (including interest rates), regulatory constraints, including, among other things, on distributions to us from our subsidiaries and required capital levels with respect to our subsidiary bank and financial subsidiaries, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, may also affect our ability to meet these needs. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows from operations, or obtain future borrowings in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt, or to fund our other liquidity needs. We may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity, and we may not be able to refinance any of our debt when needed on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments in our business, sell assets, seek to obtain additional equity or debt financing or restructure our debt on terms that may not be favorable to us.\nWe may be unable to pay dividends on our common stock and Series C Preferred Stock.\nHolders of our common stock and Series C Preferred Stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. Although we have historically paid a quarterly cash dividend to the holders of our common stock and Series C Preferred Stock, we are not legally required to do so. Further, the Federal Reserve could decide at any time that paying any dividends on our common stock or preferred stock could be an unsafe or unsound banking practice. The reduction or elimination of dividends paid on our common stock or preferred stock could adversely affect the market price of our common stock or preferred stock, as applicable. In addition, if we fail to pay dividends on our Series C Preferred Stock for six quarters, whether or not consecutive, the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock shall be entitled to certain rights to elect two directors to our Board of Directors.\nFor a discussion of current regulatory limits on our ability to pay dividends, see \u201cPart I - Item 1. Business - Supervision, Regulation and Other Factors - Dividends,\u201d \u201cPart I - Item 1A - Risk Factors - We may become subject to supervisory actions and enhanced regulation that could have a material negative effect on our business, reputation, operating flexibility, financial condition and the value of our common stock and preferred stock.\u201d and \u201cPart II - Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Repurchases of Equity Securities - Dividends\u201d in this Report for further information.\nWe may be required to repurchase mortgage loans or indemnify mortgage loan purchasers as a result of breaches of representations and warranties, borrower fraud, or certain borrower defaults, which could harm our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.\nSynovus Mortgage sells the majority of all the mortgage loans that it originates. While the loans are sold without recourse, the purchase agreements require Synovus Mortgage to make certain representations and warranties regarding the existence and sufficiency of file documentation and the absence of fraud by borrowers or other third parties such as appraisers in connection with obtaining the loan. If it is determined that loans sold were in breach of these representations or warranties, Synovus Mortgage has obligations to either repurchase the loan at the unpaid principal balance and related investor fees or make the purchaser whole for any economic losses associated with the loan. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act contains provisions designed to address perceived deficiencies in the residential mortgage loan origination and underwriting process, in part by creating new documentation requirements and underwriting criteria and increasing the potential liability of Synovus and Synovus Mortgage to their customers if Synovus and Synovus Mortgage fail to take steps to ensure and document that each borrower has the capacity and the ability to repay their loans.\nTo date, repurchase activity pursuant to the terms of these representations and warranties has been minimal and has primarily been associated with loans originated from 2005 through 2008. From January 1, 2005 through December 31, 2015, Synovus Mortgage originated and sold approximately $8.9 billion of first lien GSE eligible mortgage loans and approximately $3.9 billion of first and second lien non-GSE eligible mortgage loans. The total expense pertaining to losses from repurchases of mortgage loans previously sold, including amounts accrued in accordance with ASC 450, Contingencies, was $920 thousand, $2.0 million, and $1.7 million, for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. The total accrued liability related to mortgage repurchase claims was $3.2 million at both December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nWe may not be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future and they may be subject to additional valuation allowances, which could adversely affect our operating results and regulatory capital ratios.\nAs of December 31, 2015, Synovus had $511.9 million in net deferred tax assets, of which $341.1 million was disallowed when calculating regulatory capital. Management assesses the valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets at each reporting period. The determination of whether a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is appropriate is subject to considerable judgment and requires an evaluation of all positive and negative evidence. We had a valuation allowance of $11.7 million at\nDecember 31, 2015, which is related to specific state income tax credits that have various expiration dates through the tax year 2018 and are expected to expire before they can be utilized.\nThe valuation allowance could fluctuate in future periods based on the assessment of the positive and negative evidence. If actual results differ significantly from the current estimates of future taxable income, the valuation allowance may need to be increased. Such an increase to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nFuture changes in the tax laws could significantly impact our income tax expense, deferred tax asset balance, and the amount of taxes payable. Current proposals to lower the Federal corporate income tax rate would result in a reduction to our deferred tax asset balance upon enactment of the new tax legislation, with a corresponding one-time, non-cash increase in income tax expense. Such increase in income tax expense could be material to our results of operations. See \u201cPart II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Income Tax Expense\u201d and \"Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 22 - Income Taxes\" in this Report for further information.\nIssuances or sales of common stock or other equity securities could result in an \u201cownership change\u201d as defined for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In the event an \u201cownership change\u201d were to occur, our ability to fully utilize a significant portion of our U.S. federal and state tax net operating losses and certain built-in losses that have not been recognized for tax purposes could be impaired as a result of the operation of Section 382 of the Code.\nOur ability to use certain realized NOLs and unrealized built-in losses to offset future taxable income may be significantly limited if we experience an \u201cownership change\u201d as defined by Section 382 of the Code. An ownership change under Section 382 generally occurs when a change in the aggregate percentage ownership of the stock of the corporation held by \u201cfive percent shareholders\u201d increases by more than fifty percentage points over a rolling three-year period. A corporation experiencing an ownership change generally is subject to an annual limitation on its utilization of pre-change losses and certain post-change recognized built-in losses equal to the value of the stock of the corporation immediately before the \u201cownership change,\u201d multiplied by the long-term tax-exempt rate (subject to certain adjustments). The annual limitation is increased each year to the extent that there is an unused limitation in a prior year. Since U.S. federal net operating losses generally may be carried forward for up to 20 years, the annual limitation also effectively provides a cap on the cumulative amount of pre-change losses and certain post-change recognized built-in losses that may be utilized. Pre-change losses and certain post-change recognized built-in losses in excess of the cap are effectively unable to be used to reduce future taxable income. In some circumstances, issuances or sales of our stock (including any common stock or other equity issuances or debt-for-equity exchanges and certain transactions involving our stock that are outside of our control) could result in an \u201cownership change\u201d under Section 382.\nIn April 2010, we adopted a Rights Plan, which was approved by our shareholders in April 2011 at our 2011 annual meeting. In April 2013, our Board extended the Rights Plan to April 26, 2016, with shareholder ratification in April 2014 at our 2014 annual meeting. The Rights Plan provides an economic disincentive for any one person or group acting in concert to become an owner, for relevant tax purposes, of 5% or more of our stock and is intended to protect our NOLs from the potential negative consequence of an ownership change as defined under Section 382 of the Code.\nWhile adoption of the Rights Plan should reduce the likelihood that future transactions in our stock will result in an ownership change, there can be no assurance that the Rights Plan will be effective to deter a shareholder from increasing its ownership interests beyond the limits set by the Rights Plan or that an ownership change will not occur in the future, especially if the Rights Plan is not extended or a new Rights Plan is not adopted when the current Rights Plan terminates. Furthermore, our ability to enter into future transactions, including those requiring the issuance of additional ownership interests, may be impaired if such transactions result in an unanticipated \u201cownership change\u201d under Section 382. If an \u201cownership change\u201d under Section 382 were to occur, the value of our net operating losses and a portion of the net unrealized built-in losses will be impaired.\nThe costs and effects of litigation, investigations or similar matters involving us or other financial institutions or counterparties, or adverse facts and developments related thereto, could materially affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe may be involved from time to time in a variety of litigation, investigations, inquiries or similar matters arising out of our business, including those described in \u201cPart I - Item 3. Legal Proceedings\u201d and \"Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 19 - Legal Proceedings\" of this Report. Synovus cannot predict the outcome of these or any other legal matters. We establish reserves for legal claims when payments associated with the claims become probable and the losses can be reasonably estimated. We may still incur legal costs for a matter even if we have not established a reserve. In addition, the actual cost of resolving a legal claim may be substantially higher than any amounts reserved for that matter. For those legal matters where the amounts associated with the claims are not probable and the costs cannot be reasonably estimated, Synovus estimates a range of reasonably possible losses. As of December 31, 2015, Synovus' management currently estimates the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses resulting from our outstanding litigation, including, without limitation, the matters described in this Report is from zero to $15.0 million in excess of the amounts accrued, if any, related to those matters. This estimated aggregate range is based upon information currently available to us, and the actual losses could prove to be higher. As there are further developments in these legal matters, we will reassess these matters and the estimated range of reasonably possible losses\nmay change as a result of this assessment. In addition, in the future, we may need to record additional litigation reserves with respect to these matters. Further, regardless of how these matters proceed, it could divert our management's attention and other resources away from our business.\nOur insurance may not cover all claims that may be asserted against it and indemnification rights to which we are entitled may not be honored, and any claims asserted against us, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, may harm our reputation. Should the ultimate judgments or settlements in any litigation or investigation significantly exceed our insurance coverage, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, premiums for insurance covering the financial and banking sectors are rising. We may not be able to obtain appropriate types or levels of insurance in the future, nor may we be able to obtain adequate replacement policies with acceptable terms or at historic rates, if at all.\nOur stock price is subject to fluctuations, and the value of your investment may decline.\nThe trading price of our common stock is subject to wide fluctuations. The stock market in general, and the market for the stocks of commercial banks and other financial services companies in particular, has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that sometimes have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. hese broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance, and the value of your investment may decline.\nCertain shares of our common stock are entitled to ten votes per share on each matter submitted to a vote at a meeting of shareholders.\nAlthough we only have one class of common stock, certain shares of our common stock are entitled to ten votes per share on each matter submitted to a vote at a meeting of shareholders, including common stock that has been beneficially owned continuously by the same shareholder for a period of forty-eight consecutive months before the record date of any meeting of shareholders at which the share is eligible to be voted. Therefore, while a holder of common stock may have an economic interest in us that is identical to or even greater than another shareholder, that other shareholder may be entitled to ten times as many votes per share. As a result, some groups of shareholders will be able to approve strategic transactions or increases in authorized capital stock, among other matters submitted to the shareholders, even over the objections of shareholders, who hold equivalent or greater economic stakes in our company.\nOur articles of incorporation, our Rights Plan and certain banking laws and regulations may have an anti-takeover effect.\nProvisions of our articles of incorporation, our Rights Plan and certain banking laws and regulations, including regulatory approval requirements, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would be perceived to be beneficial to our shareholders. The combination of these provisions may inhibit a non-negotiated merger or other business combination, which, in turn, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 20053, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "SNV"}
