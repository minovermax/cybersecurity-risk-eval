Risk Factors\nAn investment in our Company involves a high degree of risk of loss. You should carefully consider the risk factors discussed below and all of the other information included in this report before you make any investment decision regarding our securities. We believe the risks and uncertainties described below are the most significant we face, but additional risks and uncertainties not known to us or that we currently deem immaterial could also be or become significant. The occurrence of any of these risks could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, prospects and reputation and could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur success is dependent on the willingness of fleets and other consumers to adopt natural gas as a vehicle fuel, which may not occur in a timely manner, at expected levels or at all.\nOur success is highly dependent on the adoption by fleets and other consumers of natural gas as a vehicle fuel. The market for natural gas as a vehicle fuel has experienced slow, volatile and unpredictable growth in many sectors. For example, adoption and deployment of natural gas vehicles, both in general and in certain of our key customer markets, including heavy-duty trucking, have been slower and more limited than we anticipated. Also, other important fleet markets, including airports, refuse and public transit, had slower volume and customer growth in 2018 and 2019 that may continue. Moreover, adoption of and demand for the different types of natural gas vehicle fuel, including CNG, LNG and RNG (which can be delivered in the form of CNG or LNG), are subject to significant risks, including decreased LNG volumes in some markets in recent periods that may continue and may not be sufficiently offset by any increase in demand for RNG or CNG. If the market for natural gas as a vehicle fuel does not develop at improved rates or levels, or if a market develops but we are not able to capture a significant share of the market or the market subsequently declines, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results would be harmed.\nFactors that may influence the adoption of natural gas as a vehicle fuel, many of which are beyond our control, include, among others:\n\u00b7\nAdoption of government policies or programs or increased publicity or popular sentiment in favor of vehicles or vehicle fuels other than natural gas, including long-standing support for gasoline and diesel-powered vehicles and growing support for electric and hydrogen-powered vehicles;\n\u00b7\nPerceptions about the benefits of renewable and conventional natural gas relative to gasoline and diesel and other alternative vehicle fuels, including with respect to factors such as supply, cost savings, environmental benefits and safety;\n\u00b7\nIncreases, decreases or volatility in the supply, demand, use and prices of crude oil, gasoline, diesel, natural gas and other vehicle fuels, such as electricity, hydrogen, renewable diesel, biodiesel and ethanol;\n\u00b7\nInertia among fleets and fleet vehicle operators, who may be unable or unwilling to prioritize converting a vehicle fleet to natural gas over an operator\u2019s other general business concerns, particularly if the operator lacks sufficient incentive to convert from emissions regulations or other requirements or lacks demand for the conversion from its customers or drivers;\n\u00b7\nNatural gas vehicle cost, fuel usage, availability, quality, safety, convenience (to fuel and service), design, performance and residual value, as well as operator perception with respect to these factors, generally and in our key customer markets and relative to comparable vehicles powered by other fuels;\n\u00b7\nThe development, production, cost, availability, performance, sales and marketing and reputation of natural gas engines that are well-suited for the vehicles used in our key customer markets, including heavy-duty trucks and other fleets;\n\u00b7\nIncreasing competition in the market for vehicle fuels generally, and the nature and effect of competitive developments in this market, including improvements in or perceived advantages of non-natural gas vehicle fuels or engines powered by these fuels;\n\u00b7\nThe availability and effect of environmental, tax or other government regulations, programs or incentives that promote natural gas or other alternatives as a vehicle fuel, including certain programs under which we generate credits by selling conventional and renewable natural gas as a vehicle fuel, as well as the market prices for such credits;\n\u00b7\nThe effect of, or potential for changes to, emissions requirements applicable to vehicles powered by gasoline, diesel, natural gas or other vehicle fuels;\n\u00b7\nEmissions and other environmental regulations and pressures on crude oil and natural gas fueling stations and drilling, production, importing and transportation methods for these fuels; and\n\u00b7\nThe other risks discussed in these risk factors.\nWe are dependent on the production of natural gas vehicles and engines in our key customer and geographic markets by vehicle and engine manufacturers, over which we have no control.\nNatural gas vehicle and engine manufacturers control the development, production, quality assurance, cost and sales and marketing of their products, which shapes the performance, availability and reputation of these products in the marketplace. Although we are dependent on these manufacturers to succeed in our target markets, we have no influence over their activities. For example, Cummins Westport is the only natural gas engine manufacturer for the heavy-duty truck market in the United States, and this and other original equipment manufacturers currently produce a relatively small number of natural gas engines and vehicles for the U.S. and Canadian markets. These manufacturers may not decide to expand or maintain, or may decide to discontinue or curtail, their natural gas engine or vehicle product lines. The limited production of natural gas engines and vehicles increases their cost and limits availability, which restricts large-scale adoption, and may reduce resale value, which may contribute to operator reluctance to convert their vehicles to natural gas. In addition, some operators have communicated to us that the first generation models of natural gas engines for heavy-duty trucks have a reputation for unsatisfactory performance, and that this reputation or their first-hand experiences of such performance may be a factor in operator decisions regarding whether or not to convert their fleets to natural gas. The success of our business strategies and initiatives depends on sufficient availability and adoption of high-performing natural gas vehicles, and as a result, any production failures by the third-party manufacturers of these vehicles or their engines could harm our results of operations, business and prospects.\nIf there are improvements in or perceived advantages of non-natural gas vehicle fuels or engines powered by these fuels, demand for natural gas vehicles may decline.\nUse of electric heavy-duty trucks, buses and refuse trucks, which are key customer markets for our business, or the perception that electric vehicles providing satisfactory performance at an acceptable cost may soon be widely available for these or other applications, could reduce demand for natural gas vehicles generally and in these key markets. In addition, hydrogen, renewable diesel and other alternative fuels in development may prove to be, or may be perceived to be, cleaner, more cost-effective, more readily available or otherwise more beneficial alternatives to gasoline and diesel than conventional or renewable natural gas. Further, technological advances in the production, delivery and use of gasoline, diesel or other alternative vehicle fuels, or the failure of natural gas vehicle fuel technology to advance at an equal pace, could slow or limit adoption of natural gas vehicles. For example, advances in gasoline and diesel engine technology, including efficiency improvements and further development of hybrid engines, may offer a more cost-effective way for operators to use a cleaner vehicle fuel, which could reduce the likelihood that fleet customers purchase natural gas vehicles or convert their existing vehicles to natural gas. If any of these risks occur, our industry, prospects and results could materially suffer.\nWe have a history of losses and may incur additional losses in the future.\nWe incurred pre-tax losses in 2017 and 2018. During 2018 and 2019, our results were positively affected by $26.7 million and $47.1 million of AFTC revenue, respectively. We may incur losses in future periods and we may never sustain profitability, either of which would adversely affect our business, prospects and financial condition and may cause the price of our common stock to fall. In addition, to try to achieve or sustain profitability, we may choose or be forced to take actions that result in material costs or material asset or goodwill impairments. For instance, in the third and fourth quarters of 2017, we recorded significant charges in connection with our former natural gas fueling compressor manufacturing business (which we subsequently combined with another company\u2019s natural gas fueling compressor manufacturing business in the CEC Combination), our closure of certain fueling stations, our determination that certain assets were impaired as a result of the foregoing, and other actions. We review our assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable and we perform a goodwill impairment test on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances, in each case in accordance with applicable accounting guidance and as described in the financial statements and related notes included in this report. Changes to the use of our assets, divestitures, changes to the structure of our business, significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our operations, inability to effectively integrate any acquired businesses, further market capitalization declines, or other similar actions or conditions could result in additional asset impairment or goodwill impairment charges or other adverse consequences, any of which could have material negative effects on our financial condition, our results of operations and the trading price of our common stock.\nOur business is influenced by environmental, tax and other government regulations, programs and incentives that promote natural gas or other alternatives as a vehicle fuel, and their adoption, modification or repeal could negatively affect our business.\nOur business is influenced by federal, state and local tax credits, rebates, grants and other government programs and incentives that promote the use of RNG, CNG and LNG as a vehicle fuel. These include various government programs that make grant funds available for the purchase of natural gas vehicles and construction of natural gas fueling stations, as well as the AFTC tax credit under which we generate revenue for our natural gas vehicle fuel sales made through the end of 2020 but which may not be available for vehicle fuel sales made after December 31, 2020, particularly if other legislative priorities result in insufficient focus on this program during upcoming congressional sessions. Additionally, our business is influenced by laws, rules and regulations that require reductions in carbon emissions and/or the use of renewable fuels, such as the programs under which we generate RINs and LCFS Credits by selling RNG, CNG and LNG as a vehicle fuel.\nThese programs and regulations, which have the effect of encouraging the use of RNG, CNG or LNG as a vehicle fuel, could expire or be repealed or amended for a variety of reasons. For example, parties with an interest in gasoline and diesel, electric or other alternative vehicles or vehicle fuels, including lawmakers, regulators, policymakers, environmental or advocacy organizations or other powerful groups, may invest significant time and money in efforts to delay, repeal or otherwise negatively influence regulations and programs that promote natural gas. Many of these parties have substantially greater resources and influence than we have. Further, changes in federal, state or local political, social or economic conditions, including a lack of legislative focus on these programs and regulations, could result in their modification, delayed adoption or repeal. Any failure to adopt, delay in implementing, expiration, repeal or modification of these\nprograms and regulations, or the adoption of any programs or regulations that encourage the use of other alternative fuels or alternative vehicles over natural gas, would reduce the market for natural gas as a vehicle fuel and harm our operating results, liquidity and financial condition. For instance, California lawmakers and regulators have implemented various measures designed to increase the use of electric, hydrogen and other zero-emission vehicles, including establishing firm goals for the number of these vehicles operating on state roads by specified dates and enacting various laws and other programs in support of these goals. Although the influence of these or similar measures on our business and natural gas vehicle adoption in general remains uncertain, a focus by these groups on zero-emission vehicles over vehicles operating on natural gas adversely affects the market for natural gas vehicles and our business prospects.\nOur RNG business may not be successful.\nOur RNG business consists of purchasing RNG from third-party producers, including BP, and reselling this RNG through our natural gas fueling infrastructure as Redeem, our RNG vehicle fuel.\nThe success of our RNG business depends on our ability to secure, on acceptable terms, a sufficient supply of RNG from BP and other third parties; to sell this RNG in adequate volumes and at prices that are attractive to customers and produce acceptable margins for us; and to sell, at favorable prices, credits we may generate under applicable federal or state programs from our sale of RNG as a vehicle fuel, including RINs and LCFS Credits. If we are not successful at one or more of these activities, our RNG business could fail and our performance and financial condition could be materially harmed.\nOur ability to maintain an adequate supply of RNG is subject to risks affecting RNG production. Projects that produce pipeline-quality RNG often experience unpredictable production levels or other difficulties due to a variety of factors, including, among others, problems with equipment, severe weather, construction delays, technical difficulties, high operating costs, limited availability or unfavorable composition of collected feedstock gas, and plant shutdowns caused by upgrades, expansion or required maintenance. In addition, increasing demand for RNG will result in more robust competition for supplies of RNG, including from other vehicle fuel providers, gas utilities (which may have distinct advantages in accessing RNG supply including potential use of ratepayer funds to fund RNG purchases if approved by a utility\u2019s regulatory commission) and other users and providers. If any of our RNG suppliers experience these or other difficulties in their RNG production processes, or if competition for RNG supply materially increases, then our supply of RNG and our ability to resell it as a vehicle fuel could be jeopardized.\nOur ability to generate revenue from our sale of RNG or our generation and sale of RINs and LCFS Credits depends on a number of factors, including the markets for RNG as a vehicle fuel and for these credits. The market for RNG as a vehicle fuel is subject to the same fluctuations and unpredictability that affect the market for natural gas vehicle fuel generally, which is discussed elsewhere in these risk factors. The markets for RINs and LCFS Credits have been volatile and unpredictable in recent periods, and the prices for these credits have been subject to fluctuations, including lower market prices for RINs since June 2019 that may continue. For example, in 2019 market prices for RINs were as high as approximately $1.90 and as low as approximately $0.50. Additionally, the value of RINs and LCFS Credits, and consequently the revenue levels we may receive from our sale of these credits, may be adversely affected by changes to the federal and state programs under which these credits are generated and sold or other market conditions. Further, our ability to generate revenue from sales of these credits depends on our strict compliance with these federal and state programs, which are complex and can involve a significant degree of judgment. If the agencies that administer and enforce these programs disagree with our judgments, otherwise determine we are not in compliance, conduct reviews of our activities or make changes to the programs, then our ability to generate or sell these credits could be temporarily restricted pending completion of reviews or as a penalty, permanently limited or lost entirely, and we could also be subject to fines or other sanctions. Any of these outcomes could force us to purchase credits in the open market to cover any credits we have contracted to sell, retire credits we may have generated but not yet sold, reduce or eliminate a significant revenue stream or incur substantial additional and unplanned expenses. We experienced many of these effects in connection with the administrative review by the CARB of our generation of LCFS Credits in the third and fourth quarters of 2017, during which we were restricted from selling and transferring accumulated LCFS Credits, we were required to make cash payments to third parties to settle preexisting commitments to transfer LCFS Credits, and certain of our LCFS Credits were invalidated. See the discussion under \u201cKey Trends-Our Performance\u201d in the MD&A in this report for more information about this administrative review and its effects. Moreover, in the absence of programs that allow us to generate\nand sell RINs and LCFS Credits or other federal and state programs that support the RNG vehicle fuel market, or if our customers are not willing to pay a premium for RNG, we may be unable to operate our RNG business profitably or at all. Any such failure of our RNG business could have a significant negative effect on our performance, cash position and prospects.\nIncreases, decreases and general volatility in oil, gasoline, diesel and natural gas prices could adversely affect our business.\nGasoline and diesel are today's most prevalent vehicle fuels. Prices for crude oil, which is the commodity used to make gasoline and diesel, have been low in recent years, due in part to over-production and increased supply without a corresponding increase in demand. If the prices of crude oil, gasoline and diesel continue to be low or decline further, or if the price of natural gas increases without corresponding increases in the prices of crude oil, gasoline and diesel, then market adoption of natural gas as a vehicle fuel could be slowed or limited. Further, any of these circumstances could decrease the market's perception of a need for alternative vehicle fuels generally, which could cause the prospects for and success of our industry and our business to materially suffer. In addition, under these pricing conditions, we may not be able to offer our customers an attractive price advantage for RNG, CNG and LNG and maintain an acceptable margin on our sales. Any such failure could result in an inability to attract new customers or a loss of demand from existing customers, or could directly and negatively affect our results of operations if we are forced to reduce the prices at which we sell natural gas to try to avoid such an effect. Conversely, if prices of gasoline and diesel increase or the price of natural gas decreases, we may not be able to capture a material portion of any increase in the demand for natural gas vehicle fuel that could result from favorable pricing conditions, due to increased competition from new entrants in the natural gas vehicle fuels market, expanded programs by existing competitors, or other factors.\nPricing conditions may also exacerbate the cost differential between natural gas vehicles and gasoline or diesel-powered vehicles, which may lead operators to delay or refrain from purchasing or converting to natural gas vehicles. Generally, natural gas vehicles cost more initially than gasoline or diesel-powered vehicles because the components needed for a vehicle to use natural gas add to the vehicle\u2019s base cost. Operators then seek to recover the additional base cost over time through the lower cost to fuel a natural gas vehicle. Operators may, however, perceive an inability to timely recover these additional initial costs if RNG, CNG and LNG fuel are not available at prices sufficiently lower than gasoline and diesel. Such an outcome could decrease our potential customer base and harm our business prospects.\nAdditionally, the prices of natural gas, crude oil, gasoline and diesel have been volatile in recent years, and this volatility may continue. Factors that may cause this volatility to continue include, among others, changes in supply and availability of crude oil and natural gas, government regulations, inventory levels, consumer demand, price and availability of alternatives, weather conditions, negative publicity about crude oil or natural gas drilling, production or importing techniques and methods, economic, health and political conditions, transportation costs and the price of foreign imports. Fluctuations in natural gas prices affect the cost to us of the natural gas commodity. High natural gas prices adversely affect our operating margins when we cannot pass the increased costs through to our customers. Conversely, lower natural gas prices reduce our revenue when the commodity cost is passed through to our customers. As a result, continued fluctuations in natural gas prices could have a significant effect on our operating results.\nWe face increasing competition from a variety of businesses, many of which have far greater resources, experience, customer bases and brand awareness than we have, and we may not be able to compete effectively with these businesses.\nThe market for vehicle fuels is highly competitive. The biggest competition for RNG, CNG and LNG use as a vehicle fuel is gasoline and diesel because the vast majority of vehicles in our key markets are powered by these fuels. We also compete with suppliers of other alternative vehicle fuels, including renewable diesel, biodiesel and ethanol, as well as producers and fuelers of alternative vehicles, including hybrid, electric and hydrogen-powered vehicles. Additionally, our stations compete directly with other natural gas fueling stations and indirectly with electric vehicle charging stations and fueling stations for other vehicle fuels. We also face high levels of competition with respect to our other business activities, including our procurement and sale of RNG and our transport and sale of CNG through the virtual natural gas pipelines and interconnects of our subsidiary, NG Advantage.\nA number of businesses are in the market for natural gas and other alternatives for use as vehicle fuel, including alternative vehicle and alternative fuel companies, refuse collectors, industrial gas companies, truck stop and fuel station owners, fuel providers, gas marketers, utilities and their affiliates and other organizations. If the alternative vehicle fuel market grows, then the number and type of participants in this market and their level of capital and other commitments to alternative vehicle fuel programs could increase. Many of our competitors have substantially greater experience, customer bases, brand awareness and financial, marketing and other resources than we have. As a result, these competitors may be able to respond more quickly to changes in customer preferences, legal requirements or other industry or regulatory trends; devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products; adopt more aggressive pricing policies; dedicate more effort to infrastructure and systems development in support of their business or product development activities; implement more robust or creative initiatives to advance consumer acceptance of their products; or exert more influence on the regulatory landscape that affects the vehicle fuels market.\nWe expect competition to increase in the vehicle fuels market generally. In addition, if the demand for natural gas vehicle fuel increases, then we expect competition in the market for natural gas vehicle fuel would also increase. Any such increased competition may reduce our customer base and revenue and may lead to increased pricing pressure, reduced operating margins and fewer expansion opportunities.\nOur Zero Now heavy-duty truck financing initiative subjects us to material risks, and if this program is not successful, our financial results and business could be materially adversely affected.\nOne of our key strategic objectives is to fuel more natural gas heavy-duty trucks. As part of our efforts to achieve this goal, we have launched the Zero Now truck financing program, which is intended to facilitate and increase the deployment of natural gas heavy-duty trucks in the United States and encourage these operators to fuel their trucks at our stations. The Zero Now program is unique and complex and subjects us to a variety of risks. See the discussion under \u201cCustomer Markets-Trucking\u201d in Part I, Item 1. Business of this report and Note 13 for information about the structure of the program and certain agreements we have established in connection with its launch.\nThe Zero Now program may not be successful for a variety of reasons, including continued slow or limited adoption of natural gas trucks by fleet operators or the occurrence of any of the other risks described in these risk factors. For example, some operators have communicated to us that their reluctance to convert to natural gas trucks stems from insufficient incentive to convert due to emissions regulations or other requirements, lack of demand for the conversion from customers and drivers, experiences or reputation of unsatisfactory performance by the first generation models of heavy-duty truck engines, actual or perceived insufficiencies in the financial incentives to convert, concern regarding the residual value of heavy-duty trucks and prioritization of other competing business concerns. If a sufficient number of truck operators do not participate in the Zero Now program, then it will not achieve its intended benefits and we will have expended substantial resources on an initiative that does not produce results.\nIn addition, the structure and terms of the program subject us to certain additional risks. For example, the term credit agreement we have established to implement the program permits us to incur substantial additional debt, and the related credit support agreement obligates us to make quarterly payments in amounts that will vary depending on the outstanding principal under the term credit agreement. These commitments are subject to, and will amplify, the risks associated with our outstanding indebtedness, which are discussed elsewhere in these risk factors. In addition, the amounts owed under the term credit agreement and the credit support agreement use LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the rate at which interest accrues. In July 2017, the U.K.\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. We intend to monitor the developments with respect to the potential discontinuance of LIBOR after 2021 and work with SG, our lender under the term credit agreement, in order to minimize the effect of such a discontinuance on our financial condition and results of operations; however, the actual effect of the anticipated discontinuance of LIBOR on us and the cost of this indebtedness remains uncertain. If SG has increased costs due to changes in LIBOR, we may experience potential increases in interest rates under the term credit agreement, which could adversely impact our interest expense, results of operations and cash flows. Further, the commodity swap arrangements we established with an affiliate of TOTAL and THUSA in connection with launching the program introduce additional risks related to volatility in crude oil prices. These arrangements are designed to protect us from fluctuations in the price of crude oil; however, we may be subject to payment obligations if truck operators participating in the program do not use all of the fuel volume covered by the arrangements and we are not able to fully and timely sell the excess fuel\nvolume to our other customers. Any obligation to make payments under our commodity swap arrangements would increase our operating expenses and decrease our available cash flow, and any efforts to sell additional gallons to our other customers to avoid such payment obligations could result in lower margins and revenues.\nMoreover, even if the Zero Now program achieves its intended goal of facilitating growth in the U.S. heavy-duty truck market, such growth may not positively affect our results for a variety of reasons. For example, if trucks purchased or financed in the program do not meet the minimum fuel purchase obligations under the supply agreements with us for any reason, including an operator experiencing lower-than-anticipated fuel demand or failing to comply with payment obligations under the supply agreement, then the program would not result in the intended growth in our fuel sales volume and consequent increase in our revenues. Although we have built America\u2019s Natural Gas Highway, or ANGH, our nationwide network of natural gas truck-friendly fueling stations, some operators may choose to fuel their natural gas vehicles elsewhere due to lack of convenient access, fuel prices or other factors. In that event, we would remain obligated to make payments under the debt agreements we have established in connection with the Zero Now program, which are based on the cost of the trucks purchased or financed in the program and not the amount of fuel volume we actually sell. As a result, we could become subject to significant payments under these debt agreements without a corresponding increase in revenues, in which case our performance and liquidity would be materially adversely affected.\nWe must effectively manage these risks to obtain the anticipated benefits from our Zero Now truck financing program and achieve our objective of fueling additional natural gas heavy-duty trucks. If we are not successful in meeting these objectives, our business, financial condition and operating results would be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may need to raise additional capital to continue to fund our business or repay our debt, which could have negative effects and may not be available when needed, on acceptable terms or at all.\nWe require capital to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness, and to pay for capital expenditures (including NG Advantage's capital expenditures), our other operating expenses, and any mergers, acquisitions or strategic investments, transactions or relationships we may pursue. If we cannot fund any of these activities with capital on-hand or cash provided by our operations, we may seek to obtain additional capital from other sources, such as by selling assets or pursuing debt or equity financing.\nAsset sales and equity or debt financing may not be available when needed, on terms favorable to us or at all. Any sale of our assets to generate cash proceeds may limit our operational capacity and could limit or eliminate any revenue streams or business plans that are dependent on the sold assets. Any issuances of our common stock or securities convertible into our common stock to raise capital would dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholders. Any debt financing we may pursue could require us to make significant interest or other payments and to pledge some or all of our assets as security. In addition, higher levels of indebtedness could increase our risk of non-repayment, adversely affect our creditworthiness and amplify the other risks associated with our existing debt, which are discussed elsewhere in these risk factors. Further, we may incur substantial costs in pursuing any capital-raising transactions, including investment banking, legal and accounting fees. On the other hand, if we are unable to obtain capital in amounts sufficient to fund our obligations, expenses and strategic initiatives, we could be forced to suspend, delay or curtail our business plans or operating activities or could default on our contractual commitments. Any such outcome could negatively affect our business, performance, liquidity and prospects.\nCompliance with greenhouse gas emissions regulations may prove costly and negatively affect our performance and financial condition.\nCalifornia has enacted laws and regulations that require specified greenhouse gas emissions reductions, and the federal government and several other state governments are considering similar measures. These regulations could affect several areas of our operations, including our sales of conventional and renewable natural gas and the operation of our CNG and LNG fueling stations and our LNG production plants. For instance, California\u2019s AB 32 law, which regulates greenhouse gas emissions from transportation fuels, including emissions associated with the CNG and LNG vehicle fuel we sell, imposes increased compliance costs on utilities, suppliers and/or users of CNG and LNG fuel. See the discussion under \u201cGovernment Regulation and Environmental Matters - Sale of Natural Gas Vehicle Fuel, Operation of Fueling Stations\nand Production of LNG: Greenhouse Gas Emissions Regulation\u201d in Part I, Item 1. Business of this report for information about the implementation of AB 32.\nThe increased costs of CNG and LNG vehicle fuel as a result of AB 32 could diminish the attractiveness of these fuels for existing and prospective customers in California, which could reduce our customer base and fuel sales in one of our key geographic markets. Additionally, to the extent we are not able to pass these increased costs through to our customers, we could experience increased expenses and reduced margins. Any of these outcomes could cause our performance to suffer, impair our ability to fulfill customer contracts and reduce our cash available for other aspects of our business. Moreover, if similar laws or regulations are adopted and implemented by other states or by the federal government, or if existing laws are amended to make them more stringent, any compliance costs associated with the new or amended laws could amplify these effects. Further, any such new or more stringent laws or regulations could require us to undertake or incur significant additional capital expenditures or other costs to, among other things, buy emissions or other environmental credits or invest in costly new emissions prevention technologies. We cannot estimate the expenses we may incur to comply with potential new laws or changes to existing laws, or the other potential effects these laws may have on our business, and these unknown costs and effects are not contemplated by our existing customer agreements or our budgets and cost estimates.\nIn addition, any failure by us to comply with existing or any future emissions laws or regulations could result in monetary penalties or a variety of other administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nNG Advantage may not be successful.\nNG Advantage\u2019s business consists of transporting and selling CNG for non-vehicle purposes via virtual natural gas pipelines and interconnects. NG Advantage transports CNG to industrial and institutional energy users that do not have direct access to natural gas pipelines. NG Advantage also transports CNG between pipelines for customers that desire to take advantage of commodity price differences. NG Advantage faces unique risks, including among others:\n\u00b7\nIt has a history of net losses and has incurred substantial indebtedness;\n\u00b7\nNG Advantage will need to raise additional capital, which may not be available, may only be available on onerous terms, or may only be available from the Company. Recently, we have been the sole source of financing for NG Advantage, consisting of loans of $26.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 and a $5.0 million equity purchase in the year ended December 31, 2018. If NG Advantage is not able to obtain financing from external sources, we may need to provide additional debt or equity capital to allow NG Advantage to satisfy its commitments and maintain operations;\n\u00b7\nIt has considerable obligations under its arrangements with BP and other customers, and if NG Advantage fails to perform under such arrangements it would be subject to significant liquidated damages and we could be subject to significant cash liabilities pursuant to the terms of our guaranty agreement with NG Advantage and BP (see the disclosure under \u201cOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\u201d in the MD&A in this report for more information about this guaranty agreement);\n\u00b7\nThe labor market for truck drivers is very competitive, which increases NG Advantage's difficulty in meeting its delivery obligations;\n\u00b7\nNG Advantage transports CNG in trailers over long distances and these trailers may be involved in accidents;\n\u00b7\nNG Advantage has been targeted by environmental groups that may disrupt its activities; and\n\u00b7\nMany of the other risks discussed in these risk factors.\nIf NG Advantage fails to manage any of these risks, our business, financial condition, liquidity results of operations, prospects and reputation may be harmed.\nOur station construction activities subject us to a number of business and operational risks.\nAs part of our business activities, we design and construct natural gas fueling stations that we either own and operate ourselves or sell to our customers. These activities require a significant amount of judgment in determining where to build and open fueling stations, including predictions about fuel demand that may not be accurate for any of the locations we target. As a result, we have built stations that we may not open for fueling operations and we may open stations that fail to generate the volume or profitability levels we anticipate, either or both of which could occur due to a lack of sufficient customer demand at the station locations or for other reasons. For any stations that are completed but unopened, we would have substantial investments in assets that do not produce revenue, and for any stations that are open and underperforming, we may decide to close the stations. We determined to close a number of underperforming stations in the third and fourth quarters of 2017 and recorded impairment charges in connection with these closures and other related actions, and any further station closures could result in substantial additional costs and non-cash asset impairments or other charges and could harm our reputation and reduce our potential customer base.\nWe also face a number of operational challenges in connection with our station design and construction activities. For example, we may not be able to identify suitable locations for the stations we or our customers seek to build. Additionally, even if preferred sites can be located, we may encounter land use or zoning difficulties, challenges obtaining and retaining required permits and approvals or local resistance, any of which could prevent us or our customers from building new stations on these sites or limit or restrict the use of new or existing stations. Any such difficulties, resistance or limitations or any failure to comply with local permit, land use or zoning requirements could restrict our activities or expose us to fines, reputational damage or other liabilities, which would harm our business and results of operations. In addition, we act as the general contractor and construction manager for new station construction and facility modification projects, and we typically rely on licensed subcontractors to perform the construction work. We may be liable for any damage we or our subcontractors cause or for injuries suffered by our employees or our subcontractors\u2019 employees during the course of work on our projects. Additionally, shortages of skilled subcontractor labor could significantly delay a project or otherwise increase our costs. Further, our expected profit from a project is based in part on assumptions about the cost of the project, and cost overruns, delays or other execution issues may, in the case of projects we complete and sell to customers, result in our failure to achieve our expected margins or cover our costs, and in the case of projects we build and own, result in our failure to achieve an acceptable rate of return. If any of these events occur, our business, operating results and liquidity could be negatively affected.\nWe have significant contracts with government entities, which are subject to unique risks.\nWe have, and expect to continue to seek, long-term RNG, CNG and LNG station construction, maintenance and fuel sale contracts with various government bodies, which accounted for 19%, 22% and 21% of our revenue in 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively. In addition to normal business risks, including the other risks discussed in these risk factors, our contracts with government entities are often subject to unique risks, some of which are beyond our control. For example, long-term government contracts and related orders are subject to cancellation if adequate appropriations for subsequent performance periods are not made. Further, the termination of funding for a government program supporting any of our government contracts could result in the loss of anticipated future revenue attributable to the contract. Moreover, government entities with which we contract are often able to modify, curtail or terminate contracts with us at their convenience and without prior notice, and would only be required to pay for work completed and commitments made at or prior to the time of termination.\nIn addition, government contracts are frequently awarded only after competitive bidding processes, which are often protracted. In many cases, unsuccessful bidders for government contracts are provided the opportunity to formally protest the contract awards through various agencies or other administrative and judicial channels. The protest process may substantially delay a successful bidder\u2019s contract performance, result in cancellation of the contract award entirely and distract management. As a result, we may not be awarded contracts for which we bid, and substantial delays or cancellation of contracts may follow any successful bids as a result of any protests by other bidders. The occurrence of any of these risks would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur operations entail inherent safety and environmental risks, which may result in substantial liability to us.\nOur operations entail inherent safety risks, including risks associated with equipment defects, malfunctions, failures and misuses. For example, operation of LNG pumps requires special training because of the extremely low temperatures of LNG. Also, LNG tanker trailers and CNG fuel tanks and trailers could rupture if involved in accidents or improper maintenance or installation. Further, improper refueling of natural gas vehicles or operation of natural gas vehicle fueling stations could result in sudden releases of pressure that could cause explosions. In addition, our stations may vent methane, a potent greenhouse gas. These safety and environmental risks could result in uncontrollable flows of natural gas, fires, explosions, death or serious injury, any of which may expose us to liability for personal injury, wrongful death, property damage, pollution and other environmental damage. We may incur substantial liability and costs if any such damages are not covered by insurance or are in excess of policy limits, or if environmental damage causes us to violate applicable greenhouse gas emissions or other environmental laws. Additionally, the occurrence of any of these events with respect to our fueling stations or our other operations could materially harm our business and reputation. Moreover, the occurrence of any of these events to any other organization in the natural gas vehicle fuel business could harm our industry generally by negatively affecting perceptions about, and adoption levels of, natural gas as a vehicle fuel.\nOur business is subject to a variety of government regulations, which may restrict our operations and result in costs and penalties.\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment, health and safety, labor and employment, building codes and construction, zoning and land use, the government procurement process, any political activities or lobbying in which we may engage, public reporting and taxation, among others. It is difficult and costly to manage the requirements of every authority having jurisdiction over our various activities and to comply with their varying standards. Many of these laws and regulations are complex, change frequently, involve significant judgment and have become more stringent over time. Any changes to existing regulations or adoption of new regulations may result in significant additional expense to us or our customers. For example, some communities and cities, like Berkeley, CA, have banned new natural gas hook-ups. Further, from time to time, as part of the regular evaluation of our operations, including newly acquired or developing operations, we may be subject to compliance audits by regulatory authorities, which may distract management from our revenue-generating activities and involve significant costs and use of other resources. Also, we often need to obtain facility permits or licenses to address, among other things, storm water or wastewater discharges, waste handling and air emissions in connection with our operations, which may subject us to onerous or costly permitting conditions or delays if permits cannot be timely obtained.\nOur failure to comply with any applicable laws and regulations could result in a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including, among others, assessment of monetary penalties, imposition of corrective requirements or prohibition from providing services to government entities. If any of these enforcement measures were imposed on us, our business, financial condition and performance could be negatively affected.\nWe may from time to time pursue acquisitions, divestitures, investments or other strategic relationships or transactions, which could fail to meet expectations or otherwise harm our business.\nWe may acquire or invest in other companies or businesses or pursue other strategic transactions or relationships, such as joint ventures, collaborations, divestitures or other similar arrangements. For example, in March 2017 we completed the BP Transaction, in December 2017 we completed the CEC Combination, and in October 2018 and January 2019 we established arrangements with THUSA and others to launch the Zero Now truck financing program.\nThese strategic transactions and relationships and any others we may pursue in the future involve numerous risks, any of which could harm our business, performance and liquidity, including, among others:\n\u00b7\nDifficulties integrating the operations, personnel, contracts, service providers and technologies of an acquired company or partner;\n\u00b7\nDiversion of financial and management resources from existing operations or alternative acquisition, investment, strategic or other opportunities;\n\u00b7\nFailure to realize the anticipated synergies or other benefits of a transaction or relationship;\n\u00b7\nFailure to identify all of the operating problems, liabilities, shortcomings or other challenges associated with a company or asset we may partner with, invest in or acquire, including issues related to regulatory compliance practices, revenue recognition or other accounting policies, intellectual property rights, employee, customer or vendor relationships, or differing business strategies, approaches, cultures or goals;\n\u00b7\nRisks of entering new customer or geographic markets in which we may have limited or no experience, including, among others, challenges satisfying differing customer demands and preferences and complying with differing laws and regulations, as well as risks related to political and economic instability in some regions, trade restrictions or barriers and currency exchange or repatriation uncertainties;\n\u00b7\nPotential loss of an acquired company\u2019s or partner\u2019s key employees, customers or vendors in the event of an acquisition or investment, or potential loss of our assets (and their associated revenue streams), employees or customers in the event of a divestiture or other strategic transaction;\n\u00b7\nRisks associated with any joint venture or other collaboration relationship we may pursue, including as a result of our relinquishing of some degree of control over the assets, technologies or businesses that are the subject of the joint venture or collaboration, or as a result of our partners having business goals and interests that are not aligned with ours or being unable or unwilling to fulfill their obligations in the relationship;\n\u00b7\nIncurrence of substantial costs or debt or equity dilution to fund an acquisition, investment or other transaction or relationship, and any inability to generate sufficient revenue from the transaction or relationship to offset such costs;\n\u00b7\nPossible write-offs or impairment charges relating to any businesses we partner with, invest in or acquire; and\n\u00b7\nThe occurrence of many of the risks described above if we fail to accurately predict trends in our key markets, which could lead us to neglect opportunities that ultimately capitalize on these trends or, conversely, pursue transactions that do not best serve our markets or customers over the long term.\nOur results of operations fluctuate significantly and are difficult to predict.\nOur results of operations have historically experienced, and may continue to experience, significant fluctuations as a result of a variety of factors, including, among others, the amount and timing of our natural gas vehicle fuel sales, station construction sales, sales of RINs and LCFS Credits and recognition of government credits, grants and incentives, such as AFTC (for example, we recorded all of the AFTC revenue associated with our vehicle fuel sales made in 2017 during the first quarter of 2018, and we recorded all of the AFTC revenue associated with our vehicles fuel sales made in 2018 and 2019 in the fourth quarter of 2019); fluctuations in commodity, station construction and labor costs and natural gas, RIN and LCFS Credit prices; variations in the fair value of certain of our derivative instruments that are recorded in revenue; the amount and timing of our billing, collections and liability payments; and the other factors described in these risk factors.\nOur performance in certain periods has also been affected by transactions or events that have resulted in significant cash or non-cash gains or losses. For example, our results for 2017 were positively affected by gains related to repurchases or retirements of our outstanding convertible debt at a discount and by a gain related to the BP Transaction, but were also negatively affected by significant charges in connection with our closure of certain fueling stations, the decreased operating performance of our former natural gas fueling compressor manufacturing business, our determination of an impairment of assets as a result of the foregoing, and certain other actions. These or other similar gains or losses may not recur regularly, in the same amounts or at all in future periods.\nThese significant fluctuations in our operating results may render period-to-period comparisons less meaningful, and investors in our securities should not rely on the results of one period as an indicator of performance in any other period. Additionally, these fluctuations in our operating results could cause our performance in any period to fall below the\nfinancial guidance we may have provided to the public or the estimates and projections of the investment community, which could negatively affect the price of our common stock.\nWe depend on key people to generate and oversee our strategies and operate our business, and our business could be harmed if we are unable to retain these key people.\nWe believe our future success is dependent on the contributions of certain key people, including our executive officers and directors. In many cases, we believe these individuals\u2019 knowledge of our business and experience in our industry would be difficult to replace. As a result, and due to the high levels of competition for talent in our industry, we may incur significant costs to try to retain these key people. All of our employees, however, including our management team, are permitted to terminate their employment relationships with us at any time, and any of our directors could resign at any time or fail to be re-elected by our stockholders on an annual basis. If we are unable to retain our key people, or if these individuals leave our Company and we are unable to attract and successfully integrate quality replacements in a timely manner and on reasonable terms, our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.\nNatural gas purchase and sale commitments may exceed demand or supply, as applicable, which could cause our costs relative to our revenue to increase.\nWe are a party to two long-term natural gas purchase agreements with a take-or-pay commitment, and we may enter into additional similar contracts in the future. These take-or-pay commitments require us to pay for the natural gas we have agreed to purchase, irrespective of whether we sell the gas. If the market for natural gas as a vehicle fuel declines or fails to develop as we anticipate, if we lose natural gas vehicle fueling customers, or if demand under any existing or future sales contract diminishes, these take-or-pay commitments may exceed our natural gas demand. In addition, we are involved in various firm commitment natural gas supply arrangements, and we may establish additional similar arrangements in the future. These arrangements require us to supply certain volumes of natural gas over specified periods of time, and subject us to deficiency payments or other penalties if we are unable to deliver the committed volumes as and when required. If we fail to generate sufficient demand for our take-or-pay purchase commitments or satisfy our firm supply commitments, our supply costs or operating expenses could increase without a corresponding increase in revenue, which could negatively affect our margins, performance and liquidity.\nWe provide financing to fleet customers for natural gas vehicles, which exposes our business to credit risks.\nWe directly lend to certain qualifying customers a portion, and occasionally all, of the purchase price of natural gas vehicles they agree to buy. This direct financing is in addition to our funding of the incremental cost of natural gas heavy-duty trucks purchased or leased in our Zero Now truck financing program. These financing activities involve a number of risks, including general credit risks associated with equipment finance relationships. For example, financed equipment often consists mostly of vehicles, which are mobile and easily damaged, lost or stolen. In addition, the borrower may default on payments, enter bankruptcy proceedings or liquidate. The materialization of any of these risks could harm our vehicle finance business and our results of operations and liquidity.\nOur warranty reserves may not adequately cover our warranty obligations, which could result in unexpected costs.\nWe provide product warranties with varying terms and durations for the stations we build and sell, and we establish reserves for the estimated liability associated with these warranties. Our warranty reserves are based on historical trends and any specifically identified warranty issues known to us, and the amounts estimated for these reserves could differ materially from the warranty costs we may actually incur. We would be adversely affected by an increase in the rate or volume of warranty claims or the amounts involved in warranty claims, any of which could increase our costs beyond our established reserves and cause our cash position and financial condition to suffer.\nWe rely on information technology in our operations, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our business.\nIncreased global IT security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. There have been several recent,\nhighly publicized cases in which organizations of various types and sizes have reported the unauthorized disclosure of customer or other confidential information, as well as cyberattacks involving the dissemination, theft and destruction of corporate information, intellectual property, cash or other valuable assets. There have also been several highly publicized cases in which hackers have requested \u201cransom\u201d payments in exchange for not disclosing customer or other confidential information or for not disabling the target company\u2019s computer or other systems. Implementing security measures designed to prevent, detect, mitigate or correct these or other IT security threats involves significant costs. Although we have taken steps to protect the security of our information systems and the data maintained in those systems, we have, from time to time, experienced threats to our data and systems, including malware and computer virus attacks and it is possible that in the future our safety and security measures will not prevent the systems\u2019 improper functioning or damage, or the improper access or disclosure of personally identifiable information such as in the event of cyberattacks. Any IT security threats that are successful against our security measures could, depending on their nature and scope, lead to the compromise of confidential information, improper use of our systems and networks, manipulation and destruction of data, operational disruptions and substantial financial outlays. Further, a cyberattack could occur and persist for an extended period of time without detection, and an investigation of any successful cyberattack would likely require significant time, costs and other resources to complete. We may be required to expend significant financial resources to protect against or to remediate such cyberattacks. In addition, our technology infrastructure and information systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, power loss and telecommunications failures. Any failure to maintain proper function, security and availability of our information systems and the data maintained in those systems could interrupt our operations, damage our reputation, subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties, harm our business relationships or increase our security and insurance costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGlobal climate change may increase the frequency and severity of weather events and the losses resulting from these events, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and the markets in which we operate.\nOver the past several years, changing weather patterns and climatic conditions have added to the unpredictability and frequency of natural disasters in certain parts of the world and have created additional uncertainty as to future trends. We cannot predict whether or to what extent natural disasters may occur or increase, nor can we predict the effect such events will have on our operations or the geographic markets in which we operate; however, any increased frequency or severity of these events could increase their overall negative effect on economic conditions in these regions and could also directly affect our operations if our fueling stations, our LNG plants or our customers\u2019 operations are damaged or otherwise subjected to limited operations as a result of such an event. The occurrence of any of these risks could negatively affect our business, performance and liquidity, and could also cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nWe may not generate sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our debt.\nWe have material indebtedness, and we are permitted to incur significant additional debt under the agreements we established in connection with our Zero Now truck financing program. Our outstanding and permitted indebtedness could make us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general U.S. and worldwide economic, regulatory and competitive conditions, limit our flexibility to plan for or react to changes in our business or industry, place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or limit our ability to borrow or otherwise raise additional capital as needed.\nOur payments of amounts owed under our agreements related to our Zero Now program and various other debt instruments will reduce our cash resources available for other purposes, including pursuing strategic initiatives, transactions or other opportunities, satisfying our other commitments and generally supporting our operations. Moreover, our ability to make these payments depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors, including those described in these risk factors, and many of which are beyond our control. Our business may not generate sufficient cash from operations to service our debt.\nIf we cannot meet our debt obligations from our operating cash flows, we may pursue one or more alternative measures. For instance, we are permitted to issue up to 14.0 million shares of our common stock to repay part of the outstanding principal amount of our outstanding convertible notes due June 2020. Any repayment of our debt with equity, however, would dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders. Additionally, because the agreements\ngoverning much of our existing indebtedness contain minimal restrictions on our ability to incur additional debt and do not require us to maintain financial ratios or specified levels of net worth or liquidity, we may seek capital from other sources to service our debt, such as selling assets, restructuring or refinancing our existing debt or obtaining additional equity or debt financing. Our ability to engage in any of these activities, if we decide to do so, would depend on the capital markets and the state of our industry, business and financial condition at the time, and could also subject us to significant risks, which are discussed elsewhere in these risk factors. Moreover, we may not be able to obtain any additional capital we may pursue on desirable terms, at a desirable time or at all. Any failure to pay our debts when due could result in a default on our debt obligations. In addition, certain of our debt agreements contain restrictive covenants, and any failure by us to comply with these covenants could also cause us to be in default under these agreements.\nIn the event of any default on our debt obligations, the holders of the indebtedness could, among other things, declare all amounts owed immediately due and payable. Additionally, with respect to any amounts owed under our term credit agreement that are paid by THUSA pursuant to its guaranty rather than by us, THUSA would be permitted to take direct possession of funds paid by fleet operators under any fuel supply agreements we establish in connection with our Zero Now truck financing program. Any such declaration or possession of funds could deplete all or a large portion of our available cash flow, and thereby reduce the amount of cash available to pursue our business plans or force us into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nA significant portion of our common stock is beneficially owned by a single stockholder that may have interests that differ from yours and that is able to exert significant influence over our corporate decisions, including a change of control.\nFollowing our issuance and sale of our common stock to Total in June 2018, Total holds approximately 25% of our outstanding shares of common stock and the largest ownership position of our Company. In addition, TOTAL was granted certain special rights that our other stockholders do not have in connection with its acquisition of this ownership position, including the right to designate two individuals to serve as directors of our Company and a third individual to serve as an observer on certain of our board committees. TOTAL or other large stockholders may be able to influence or control matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and mergers, acquisitions or other extraordinary transactions. TOTAL, however, may have interests that differ from yours and may vote or otherwise act in ways with which you disagree or that may be adverse to your interests. A concentration of stock ownership may also have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change of control of our Company, which could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock as part of a sale of our Company and could affect the market price of our common stock. Conversely, such a concentration of stock ownership may facilitate a change of control under terms you and other stockholders may not find favorable or at a time when you and other stockholders may prefer not to sell.\nSales of our common stock, or the perception that such sales may occur, could cause the market price of our stock to drop significantly, regardless of the state of our business.\nAll outstanding shares of our common stock are eligible for sale in the public market, subject in certain cases to the requirements of Rule 144 under the Securities Act. Also, shares of our common stock that may be issued upon the exercise, vesting or conversion of our outstanding stock options, restricted stock units and convertible notes may be eligible for sale in the public market, to the extent permitted by Rule 144 and the provisions of the applicable stock option, restricted stock unit and convertible note agreements or if such shares have been registered under the Securities Act. For instance, we filed a registration statement with the SEC to cover the resale of the 50,856,296 shares of our common stock issued and sold to Total, which such registration statement was declared effect in August 2018. We have also registered for resale all shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the 7.5% notes originally issued to T. Boone Pickens and Green Energy Investment Holdings, LLC in June 2013. See Note 13 for additional information. If these shares are sold, or if it is perceived that they may be sold, in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nThe price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate significantly, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nThe market price of our common stock has experienced, and may continue to experience, significant volatility. Factors that may cause volatility in the price of our common stock, many of which are beyond our control, include, among others:\n\u00b7\nThe factors that may influence the adoption of natural gas as a vehicle fuel, as discussed elsewhere in these risk factors;\n\u00b7\nOur ability to implement our business plans and initiatives, such as our Zero Now truck financing program, and their anticipated, perceived or actual level of success;\n\u00b7\nFailure to meet or exceed any financial guidance we have provided to the public or the estimates and projections of the investment community;\n\u00b7\nThe market\u2019s perception of the success and importance of any of our acquisitions, divestitures, investments or other strategic relationships or transactions;\n\u00b7\nThe amount of and timing of sales of, and prices for, RINs and LCFS Credits;\n\u00b7\nChanges in political, regulatory, economic and market conditions;\n\u00b7\nChanges to our management, including officer or director departures, replacements or other changes;\n\u00b7\nOur issuance of additional shares of our common stock (or securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock);\n\u00b7\nA change in the trading volume of our common stock; and\n\u00b7\nThe other risks described in these risk factors.\nIn addition, the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies, but which have affected the market prices of these companies\u2019 securities. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nVolatility or declines in the market price of our common stock could have other negative consequences, including, among others, further impairments to our assets (following the asset impairment charges we recorded in the third and fourth quarters of 2017 related to our former natural gas fueling compressor manufacturing business and our closure of certain fueling stations), potential impairments to our goodwill and a reduced ability to use our common stock for capital-raising, acquisitions or other purposes. The occurrence of any of these risks could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity and could cause further declines in the market price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 92035, "SIC": 5500, "TIC": "CLNE"}
