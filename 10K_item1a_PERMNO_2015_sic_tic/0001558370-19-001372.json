{"cik": "1121142", "company": "Maxar Technologies Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-01", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nWe operate in a changing global environment that involves numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The occurrence of any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, prospects, results of operations and cash flows. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThe decline of our GeoComm business may adversely impact our financial results.\nThe outlook on our geostationary satellite manufacturing business (\u201cGeoComm\u201d) declined substantially during the year ended December 31, 2018 and negatively impacted our Space Systems segment. At the beginning of the year, we\nforecasted the GeoComm business would be awarded three to four contracts for GeoComm satellites, or approximately thirty percent of the overall 2018 industry awards. However, during the second half of the year, it became clear that industry and macroeconomic factors had declined substantially from earlier forecasts. We were awarded one contract during 2018, and industry awards were lower than expected. Due to the decline in the GeoComm market, and the uncertainty surrounding the future of our GeoComm business, we recognized net impairment losses of $232 million and inventory impairment of $66 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. See Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-Impairment of Long-Lived Assets\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nWe have explored strategic alternatives regarding the future of our GeoComm business, including partnering with an existing satellite manufacturer to gain scale benefits; selling the GeoComm business; or exiting the GeoComm business following completion of existing contracts in backlog and the sale of its facilities. We continue to operate the GeoComm business and are completing projects in our backlog while pursuing new awards.\nIf we are unable to win new awards or execute existing contracts as expected, our business, results of operations and financial position could be further adversely affected.\nWe may be required to recognize additional impairment charges.\nLong-lived assets, including goodwill and intangible assets, are tested annually for impairment in the fourth quarter or whenever there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized net impairment losses of $1.1 billion related to goodwill, intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, inventory and orbital receivables. The impairment recognized was related to the further decline in the GeoComm business, the sustained decline in our stock price, and the loss of our WorldView-4 satellite. See Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nDisruptions to our business, unexpected significant declines in our operating results, adverse technological events or changes in the regulatory markets in which we operate, and significant declines in our stock price may result in further impairment charges to our tangible and intangible assets. Any future impairment charges could substantially affect our reported results.\nThe future revenue and operating results of the Space Systems segment are dependent on our ability to generate a sustainable order rate for the satellite manufacturing operations and develop new technologies to meet the needs of our customers or potential new customers.\nThe Space Systems segment\u2019s financial performance is dependent on its ability to generate a sustainable order rate for its satellite manufacturing operations. This can be challenging and may fluctuate on an annual basis as the number of satellite construction contracts awarded varies. The cyclical nature of the commercial satellite market could negatively impact our ability to accurately forecast customer demand. The markets that we serve may not grow in the future and it may not be able to maintain adequate gross margins or profits in these markets. Our growth is dependent on the growth in the sales of services provided by our customers, our customers\u2019 ability to anticipate market trends, and our ability to anticipate changes in the businesses of our customers and to successfully identify and enter new markets. If we fail to anticipate such changes in demand, our business, results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected.\nThe satellite manufacturing industry is characterized by development of technologies to meet changing customer demand for complex and reliable services. Our systems embody complex technology and may not always be compatible with current and evolving technical standards and systems developed by others. Failure or delays to meet or comply with the requisite and evolving industry or user standards could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business with various governmental entities is concentrated in a small number of primary contracts. The loss or reduction in scope of any one of our primary contracts would materially reduce our revenue.\nOur business with various governmental entities is concentrated in a small number of primary contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized $890 million of revenue from U.S. government agencies and approximately $420 million of our U.S. government revenue (representing approximately 20% of our total revenue) was generated from a single contract, the EnhancedView Contract. The EnhancedView Contract is a service level agreement to provide image-tasking capacity on our satellites, and other imagery-derived products and services to the U.S. government. Our ability to service other customers could be negatively impacted if we are unable to maintain our current collection capacity. In addition, any inability on our part to meet the performance requirements of the EnhancedView Contract could result in a performance penalty or breach of that contract. A breach of our contract with government customers or reduction in service to our other customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The U.S. government may also terminate or suspend our contracts, including the EnhancedView Contract, at any time with or without cause. Additionally, any changes in the size, scope or term of the EnhancedView Contract could impact our satellite replenishment strategy and our ability to repay or refinance our long-term debt. Although our contracts generally involve fixed annual minimum commitments, such commitments, along with all other contracts with the U.S. government, are subject to annual Congressional appropriations and the federal budget process, and as a result, the U.S. government may not continue to fund these contracts at current or anticipated levels. Similarly, our contracts in Canada and other jurisdictions are also subject to government procurement policies and procedures.\nOur business with various governmental entities is subject to the policies, priorities, regulations, mandates, and funding levels of such governmental entities and may be negatively or positively impacted by any change thereto.\nChanges in government policies, priorities, regulations, use of commercial data providers to meet U.S. government imagery needs, government agency mandates, funding levels through agency budget reductions, the imposition of budgetary constraints or a decline in government support or deferment of funding for programs in which we or our customers participate could result in contract terminations, delays in contract awards, reduction in contract scope, performance penalties or breaches of our contracts, the failure to exercise contract options, the cancellation of planned procurements and fewer new business opportunities, all of which could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to the procurement policies and procedures set forth in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (\u201cFAR\u201d). FAR governs all aspects of government contracting, including contractor qualifications and acquisition procedures. The FAR provisions in U.S. government contracts must be complied with in order for the contract to be awarded and provides for audits and reviews of contract procurement, performance and administration. Failure to comply with the provisions of FAR could result in contract termination.\nIn addition, contracts with any government, including the U.S. or Canadian government, may be terminated or suspended by the government at any time and could result in significant liability obligations for us. We seek to have in place as standard provisions, termination for convenience language which reimburses it for reasonable costs incurred, subcontractor and employee termination and wind-down costs plus a reasonable amount of profit thereon. However, reparations for termination may fall short of the financial benefit associated with full completion and operation of a contract. In addition, we may not be able to procure new contracts to offset the revenue or backlog lost as a result of any termination of government contracts. The loss of one or more large contracts could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nDisruptions in U.S. government operations and funding could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows and otherwise adversely affect our financial condition.\nAny disruptions in federal government operations could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows. A prolonged failure to maintain significant U.S. government operations, particularly those pertaining to our business, could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows. Continued uncertainty related to recent and future U.S. federal government shutdowns, the U.S. budget and/or failure of the U.S. government to enact annual appropriations could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows. Additionally,\ndisruptions in federal government operations may negatively impact regulatory approvals and guidance that are important to our operations.\nChanges in U.S. government policy regarding use of commercial data providers, or material delay or cancellation of certain U.S. government programs, may have a material adverse effect on our revenue and our ability to achieve our growth objectives.\nCurrent U.S. government policy encourages the U.S. government\u2019s use of commercial data providers to support U.S. national security objectives. Under the EnhancedView Contract, our contractual counterparty acquires imagery and imagery-derived products on behalf of our customers within the U.S. government. We are considered by the U.S. government to be a commercial data provider. U.S. government policy is subject to change and any change in policy away from supporting the use of commercial data providers to meet U.S. government imagery needs, or any material delay or cancellation of planned U.S. government programs, including the EnhancedView Contract, could materially adversely affect our revenue and our ability to achieve our growth objectives.\nUncertain global macro-economic and political conditions could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur results of operations are materially affected by economic and political conditions in the United States, Canada and internationally, including inflation, deflation, interest rates, availability of capital, energy and commodity prices, trade laws, and the effects of governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions. Current or potential customers may delay or decrease spending on our products and services as their business and/or budgets are impacted by economic conditions. The inability of current and potential customers to pay us for our products and services may adversely affect our earnings and cash flows.\nWe are dependent on resellers of our products and services for a significant portion of our revenue. If these resellers fail to market or sell our products and services successfully, our business could be harmed.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2018, the Imagery segment generated approximately 9% of its revenue from foreign and domestic resellers. In the Imagery segment, we rely on foreign resellers and partners to market and sell the majority of our products and services in the international market. Our foreign resellers and partners may not have the skill or experience to develop regional commercial markets for our products and services, or may have competing interests that negatively affect their sales of our products and services. If we fail to enter into reseller agreements on a timely basis or if our resellers and partners fail to market and sell our products and services successfully, these failures could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe often rely on a single vendor or a limited number of vendors to provide certain key products or services and the inability of these key vendors to meet our needs could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nHistorically, we have contracted with a single vendor or a limited number of vendors to provide certain key products or services, such as construction of satellites and launch vehicles, and management of certain remote ground terminals and direct access facilities. In addition, our manufacturing operations depend on specific technologies and companies for which there may be a limited number of vendors. If these vendors are unable to meet our needs because they fail to perform adequately, are unable to match new technological requirements or problems, or are unable to dedicate engineering and other resources necessary to provide the services contracted for, our business, financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected. While alternative sources for these products, services and technologies may exist, we may not be able to develop these alternative sources quickly and cost-effectively, which could materially impair our ability to operate our business. Furthermore, these vendors may request changes in pricing, payment terms or other contractual obligations, which could cause us to make substantial additional investments.\nOur revenue, results of operations and reputation may be negatively impacted if our products contain defects or fail to operate in the expected manner.\nWe sell complex and technologically advanced systems, including satellites, products, hardware and software. Sophisticated software, including software developed by us, may contain defects that can unexpectedly interfere with the software\u2019s intended operation. Defects may also occur in components and products that we manufacture or purchase from third parties. Most of the satellites and systems we have developed must function under demanding and unpredictable operating conditions and in harsh and potentially destructive environments. In addition, we may agree to the in-orbit delivery of a satellite, adding further risks to our ability to perform under a contract. Failure to achieve successful in-orbit delivery could result in significant penalties and other obligations on us. We employ sophisticated design and testing processes and practices, which include a range of stringent factory and on-site acceptance tests with criteria and requirements that are jointly developed with customers. Our systems may not be successfully implemented, pass required acceptance criteria, or operate or give the desired output, or we may not be able to detect and fix all defects in the satellites, products, hardware and software it sells or resolve any delays or availability issues in the launch services it procures. Failure to do so could result in lost revenue and damage to our reputation, and may adversely affect our ability to win new contract awards.\nNew satellites are subject to construction and launch delays, launch failures, damage or destruction during launch, the occurrence of which can materially and adversely affect our operations.\nDelays in the construction of future satellites and the procurement of requisite components and launch vehicles, limited availability of appropriate launch windows, possible delays in obtaining regulatory approvals, satellite damage or destruction during launch, launch failures, or incorrect orbital placement could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The loss of, or damage to, a satellite due to a launch failure could result in significant delays in anticipated revenue to be generated by that satellite. Any significant delay in the commencement of service of a satellite would delay or potentially permanently reduce the revenue anticipated to be generated by that satellite. In addition, if the loss of a satellite were to occur, we may not be able to accommodate affected customers with our other satellites or data from another source until a replacement satellite is available, and we may not have on hand, or be able to obtain in a timely manner, the necessary funds to cover the cost of any necessary satellite replacement. Any launch delay, launch failure, underperformance, delay or perceived delay could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, business prospects and financial condition.\nIf our satellites fail to operate as intended, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe manufacturing, testing, launching and operation of satellites involves complex processes and technology. Our satellites employ advanced technologies and sensors that are exposed to severe environmental stresses in space that could affect the performance of our satellite. Hardware component problems in space could lead to deterioration in performance or loss of functionality of a satellite. In addition, human operators may execute improper implementation commands that may negatively impact a satellite\u2019s performance. Exposure of our satellites to an unanticipated catastrophic event, such as a meteor shower or a collision with space debris, could reduce the performance of, or completely destroy, the affected satellite. In December 2018, our WorldView-4 satellite experienced a failure in its control moment gyros, preventing the satellite from collecting imagery. See Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis-Recent Developments-WorldView-4 Satellite\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nWe cannot provide assurances that our satellites will continue to operate successfully in space throughout their expected operational lives. Even if a satellite is operated properly, technical flaws in that satellite\u2019s sensors or other technical deficiencies or anomalies could significantly hinder its performance, which could materially affect our ability to collect imagery and market our products and services successfully. While some anomalies are covered by insurance policies, others are not or may not be covered, or may be subject to large deductibles.\nIf we suffer a partial or total loss of a deployed satellite, we would need a significant amount of time and would incur substantial expense to replace that satellite. We may experience other problems with our satellites that may reduce their\nperformance. During any period of time in which a satellite is not fully operational, we may lose most or all of the revenue that otherwise would have been derived from that satellite. Our inability to repair or replace a defective satellite or correct any other technical problem in a timely manner could result in a significant loss of revenue. If a satellite experiences a significant anomaly such that it becomes impaired or is no longer functional, it would significantly impact our business, prospects and profitability. Additionally, our review of satellite lives could extend or shorten the depreciable lives of it our satellites, which would have an impact on the depreciation we recognize.\nLoss of, or damage to, a satellite before the end of its expected operational life and the failure to obtain data or alternate sources of data for our products may have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn the Imagery segment, we rely on data collected from a number of sources including data obtained from satellites. We may become unable or limited in our ability to collect such data. For example, satellites can temporarily go out of service and be recovered, or cease to function for reasons beyond our control, including the quality of design and construction, the supply of fuel, the expected gradual environmental degradation of solar panels, the durability of various satellite components and the orbits and space environments in which the satellites are placed and operated. Our satellites have certain redundant systems which can fail partially or in their entirety and accordingly satellites can operate for extended periods without all redundant systems in operation, but with single points of failure. The failure of satellite components could cause damage to or loss of the use of a satellite before the end of its expected operational life. Electrostatic storms or collisions with other objects could also damage the satellites. Additionally, in certain instances, governments may discontinue for periods of time the access to or operation of a satellite for any particular area on the Earth and for various reasons may not permit transmission of certain data, whether from a satellite owned by the government or not. We cannot offer assurances that each satellite will remain in operation until the end of its expected operational life. Furthermore, we expect the performance of each satellite to decline gradually near the end of its expected operational life. We can offer no assurance that our satellites will maintain their prescribed orbits or remain operational.\nInterruption or failure of our infrastructure could hurt our ability to effectively perform our daily operations and provide and produce our products and services, which could damage our reputation and harm our operating results.\nWe are vulnerable to natural disasters and significant disruptions including tsunamis, floods, earthquakes, fires, water shortages, other extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics, acts of terrorism, power shortages and blackouts, and telecommunications failures. In the event of such a natural disaster or other disruption, we could experience: disruptions to our operations or the operations of suppliers, subcontractors, distributors or customers; destruction of facilities; and / or loss of life.\nThe availability of many of our products and services depends on the continuing operation of our satellite operations infrastructure, satellite manufacturing operations, information technology and communications systems. Any downtime, damage to or failure of our systems could result in interruptions in our service, which could reduce our revenue and profits. Our systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, computer denial of service attacks or other attempts to harm our systems. We do not currently maintain a back-up production facility from which we can continue to collect, process and deliver imagery in the event of the loss of our primary facility. In the event we are unable to collect, process and deliver imagery from our facility, our daily operations and operating results would be materially and adversely affected. In addition, our ground terminal centers are vulnerable to damage or interruption from human error, intentional bad acts, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, war, terrorist attacks, power losses, hardware failures, systems failures, telecommunications failures and similar events. Our satellite manufacturing operations are located in California in proximity to the San Andreas fault line, one of the longest and most heavily populated earthquake-prone rifts in the world. We do not maintain back-up manufacturing facilities or operations.\nThe occurrence of any of the foregoing could result in lengthy interruptions in our services and/or damage our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAny significant disruption in or unauthorized access to our computer systems or those of third parties that we utilize in our operations, including those relating to cybersecurity or arising from cyber-attacks, could result in a loss or degradation of service, unauthorized disclosure of data, or theft of intellectual property, any of which could materially adversely impact our business.\nOur customers and products depend upon the reliable performance and security of our computer systems and those of the third parties that we utilize in our operations. These systems may be subject to damage or interruption from earthquakes, adverse weather conditions, other natural disasters, terrorist attacks, power loss and telecommunications failures. Interruptions in these systems, or with the internet in general, could degrade or disrupt our ability to deliver our products and services to our customers.\nIn addition, we face the risk of a security breach or other significant disruption of our IT networks and related systems from a number of sources, including individual and state-sponsored actors, whether through cyber-attack or cyber intrusion via the internet, malware, computer viruses, email attachments to persons with access to our systems, denial of service attacks, physical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions.\nWe also face the added risk of a security breach or other serious disruption of the systems that we develop and install for customers or that we develop and provide in our products. As a provider of communication satellites and complex systems, we face a heightened risk of security breach or disruption from threats to gain unauthorized access to our systems and our customers\u2019 proprietary or classified information stored on our IT networks and related systems and to certain of the equipment used in our customers\u2019 IT networks or related systems.\nWhile we have implemented certain systems and processes to help thwart hackers and protect our data and systems, the techniques used to gain unauthorized access to data and software are constantly evolving, and we may be unable to anticipate or prevent all unauthorized access. Because of our highly desired intellectual property and our support of the U.S. government and other governments, we (and/or third parties we use) may be a particularly attractive target for such attacks by hostile foreign governments. From time to time, we have experienced computer viruses and other forms of third-party attacks on our systems that, to date, have not had a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot offer assurances, however, that future attacks will not materially adversely affect our business.\nA security breach or other significant disruption involving these types of information, IT networks and related systems could:\n\u00b7\ndisrupt the proper functioning of our networks and systems and therefore our operations and/or those of certain of our customers;\n\u00b7\nresult in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of, our or our customers\u2019 proprietary, confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information, including trade secrets, which others could use to compete against us or for disruptive, destructive or otherwise harmful purposes and outcomes;\n\u00b7\ncompromise other sensitive government functions; and\n\u00b7\ndamage our reputation with our customers (particularly agencies of various governments) and the public generally.\nA security breach that involves classified or other sensitive government information or certain controlled technical information, could subject us to civil or criminal penalties and could result in loss of our secure facility clearance and other accreditations, loss of our government contracts, loss of access to classified information, loss of export privileges or debarment as a government contractor. The risk that these types of events could seriously harm our business is likely to increase as we expand the number of web-based products and services we offer as well as increase the number of countries within which we do business.\nAny attempt by hackers to obtain our data or intellectual property, disrupt our service, or otherwise access our systems, or those of third parties we use, if successful, could harm our business, be expensive to remedy and damage our reputation.\nOur business involves significant risks and uncertainties that may not be covered by insurance.\nA significant portion of our business relates to designing, developing and manufacturing advanced space technology products and systems. New technologies may be untested or unproven. Failure of some of these products and services could result in extensive property damage. Accordingly, we may incur liabilities that are unique to our products and services.\nWe endeavor to obtain insurance coverage from established insurance carriers to cover these risks and liabilities. However, the amount of insurance coverage that we maintain may not be adequate to cover all claims or liabilities. Existing coverage may be canceled while we remain exposed to the risk and it is not possible to obtain insurance to protect against all operational risks, natural hazards and liabilities.\nWe have historically insured satellites in our constellation to the extent that insurance was available on acceptable premiums and other terms. The insurance proceeds received in connection with a partial or total loss of the functional capacity of any of our satellites would not be sufficient to cover the replacement cost, if we choose to do so, of an equivalent high-resolution satellite. In addition, this insurance will not protect us against all losses to our satellites due to specified exclusions, deductibles and material change limitations and it may be difficult to insure against certain risks, including a partial deterioration in satellite performance and satellite re-entry.\nThe price and availability of insurance fluctuate significantly. Although we have historically been able to obtain insurance coverage for in-orbit satellites, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to do so in the future. We intend to maintain insurance for our operating satellites, but any determination we make as to whether to obtain insurance coverage will depend on a variety of factors, including the availability of insurance in the market, the cost of available insurance and the redundancy of our operating satellites. Insurance market conditions or factors outside our control at the time we are in the market for the required insurance, such as failure of a satellite using similar components, could cause premiums to be significantly higher than current estimates and could reduce amounts of available coverage. Higher premiums on insurance policies will increase our costs and consequently reduce our operating income by the amount of such increased premiums. If the terms of in-orbit insurance policies become less favorable than those currently available, there may be limits on the amount of coverage that we can obtain or we may not be able to obtain insurance at all. Even if obtained, our in-orbit operations insurance will not cover any loss in revenue incurred as a result of a partial or total satellite loss.\nIn addition, even though we carry business interruption insurance policies, any business interruption losses could exceed the coverage available or be excluded from our insurance policies. Any disruption of our ability to operate our business could result in a material decrease in our revenues or significant additional costs to replace, repair or insure our assets, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nDisruptions in the supply of key raw materials or components and difficulties in the supplier qualification process, as well as increases in prices of raw materials, could adversely impact us.\nMany raw materials, major components and product equipment items, particularly in our Space Systems segment, are procured or subcontracted on a single or sole-source basis. Although we maintain a qualification and performance surveillance process and we believe that sources of supply for raw materials and components are generally adequate, it is difficult to predict what effects shortages or price increases may have in the future. Our ability to manage inventory and meet delivery requirements may be constrained by our suppliers\u2019 inability to scale production and adjust delivery of long-lead time products during times of volatile demand. Our inability to fill our supply needs would jeopardize our ability to fulfill obligations under commercial and government contracts, which could, in turn, result in reduced sales and profits, contract penalties or terminations, and damage to customer relationships and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, or cash flows.\nKey raw materials used in our operations include metals such as aluminum and titanium, which are usually procured by our suppliers who manufacture parts in accordance with our drawings. We also purchase materials such as chemicals; composites; electronic, electro-mechanical and mechanical components; subassemblies; and subsystems that are\nintegrated with the manufactured parts for final assembly into finished products and systems. We are impacted by increases in the prices of raw materials used in production on fixed-price business.\nWe monitor sources of supply to attempt to assure that adequate raw materials and other supplies needed in manufacturing processes are available.\nAlthough we have not experienced significant difficulty in our ability to procure raw materials, components, sub-assemblies and other supplies required in our manufacturing processes, prolonged disruptions in the supply of any of our key raw materials or components, difficulty completing qualification of new sources of supply, implementing use of replacement materials, components or new sources of supply, or a continuing increase in the prices of raw materials, energy or components could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, or cash flows.\nWe may not be successful in developing new technology and the technology we are successful in developing may not meet the needs of our customers or potential new customers.\nThe markets in which we operate are characterized by changing technology and evolving industry standards. Despite years of experience in meeting customer systems requirements with the latest in technological solutions, we may not be successful in identifying, developing and marketing products or systems that respond to rapid technological change, evolving technical standards and systems developed by others. Our competitors may develop technology that better meets the needs of our customers. If we do not continue to develop, manufacture and market innovative technologies or applications that meet customers\u2019 requirements, sales may suffer and our business may not continue to grow in line with historical rates or at all. If we are unable to achieve sustained growth, we may be unable to execute our business strategy, expand our business or fund other liquidity needs and our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur technology may violate the proprietary rights of third parties and our intellectual property may be misappropriated or infringed upon by third parties, each of which could have a negative impact on our operations.\nIf any of our technology violates proprietary rights, including copyrights and patents, third parties may assert infringement claims against us. Certain software modules and other intellectual property used by us or in our satellites, systems and products make use of or incorporate licensed software components and other licensed technology. These components are developed by third parties over whom we have no control. Any claims brought against us may result in limitations on our ability to use the intellectual property subject to these claims. We may be required to redesign our satellites, systems or products or to obtain licenses from third parties to continue offering our satellites, systems or products without substantially re-engineering such products or systems.\nOur intellectual property rights may be invalidated, circumvented, challenged, infringed or required to be licensed to others. An infringement or misappropriation could harm any competitive advantage we currently derive or may derive from our proprietary rights.\nTo protect our proprietary rights, we rely on a combination of patent protections, copyrights, trade secrets, trademark laws, confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties, and protective contractual provisions such as those contained in license agreements with consultants, subcontractors, vendors and customers. Although we apply rigorous standards, documents and processes to protect our intellectual property, there is no absolute assurance that the steps taken to protect our technology will prevent misappropriation or infringement. Litigation may be necessary to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights, our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Such litigation may be time-consuming and expensive to prosecute or defend and could result in the diversion of our time and resources. In addition, competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies.\nWe face competition that may cause us to have to either reduce our prices for imagery and related products and services or to lose market share.\nOur products and services compete with satellite and aerial imagery and related products and services offered by a range of private and government providers. Our current or future competitors may have superior technologies or greater\nfinancial, personnel and other resources than we have. The value of our imagery may also be diluted by Earth imagery that is available free of charge.\nThe U.S. government and foreign governments may develop, construct, launch and operate their own imagery satellites, which could reduce their need to rely on us and other commercial suppliers. In addition, such governments could sell or provide free of charge Earth imagery from their satellites and thereby compete with our imagery products and services. Also, governments may at times make our imagery freely available for humanitarian purposes, which could impair our revenue growth with non-governmental organizations. These governments could also subsidize the development, launch and operation of imagery satellites by our current or future competitors.\nOur competitors or potential competitors could, in the future, offer satellite-based imagery or other products and services with more attractive features than our products and services. The emergence of new remote imaging technologies or the continued growth of low-cost imaging satellites, could negatively affect our marketing efforts. More importantly, if competitors develop and launch satellites or other imagery-content sources with more advanced capabilities and technologies than ours, or offer products and services at lower prices than ours, our business and results of operations could be harmed. Due to competitive pricing pressures, such as new product introductions by us or our competitors or other factors, the selling price of our products and services may further decrease. If we are unable to offset decreases in our average selling prices by increasing our sales volumes or by adjusting our product mix, our revenue and operating margins may decline and our financial position may be harmed.\nWe operate in highly competitive industries and in various jurisdictions across the world which may cause us to have to reduce our prices.\nWe operate in highly competitive industries and many of our competitors are larger and have substantially greater resources than we have. In addition, some of our foreign competitors currently benefit from, and others may benefit in the future from, protective measures by their home countries where governments are providing financial support, including significant investments in the development of new technologies. Government support of this nature greatly reduces the commercial risks associated with satellite development activities for these competitors. This market environment may result in increased pressures on our pricing and other competitive factors.\nThe market may not accept our imagery products and services. Our historic growth rates should not be relied upon as an indicator of future growth.\nWe cannot accurately predict whether our products and services will achieve significant market acceptance or whether there will be a market for our products and services on terms we find acceptable. Market acceptance of our commercial high-resolution Earth imagery and related products and services depends on a number of factors, including the quality, scope, timeliness, sophistication, price and the availability of substitute products and services. Lack of significant market acceptance of our offerings, or other products and services that utilize our imagery, delays in acceptance, failure of certain markets to develop or our need to make significant investments to achieve acceptance by the market would negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may not continue to grow in line with historical rates or at all. If we are unable to achieve sustained growth, we may be unable to execute our business strategy, expand our business or fund other liquidity needs and our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe are dependent on our ability to attract, train and retain employees. Our inability to do so, or the loss of key personnel, would cause serious harm to our business.\nOur success is largely dependent on the abilities and experience of our executive officers and other key personnel to oversee all aspects of our operations and to deliver on our corporate strategies, including managing acquisitions and execution of our U.S. Access Plan. Competition for highly skilled management, technical, research and development and other personnel is intense in our industry. In order to maintain our ability to compete, we must continuously retain the services of a core group of specialists in a wide variety of disciplines. To the extent that the demand for qualified personnel exceeds supply, we could experience higher labor, recruiting or training costs in order to attract and retain such employees, or could experience difficulties in performing under contracts if our need for such employees is unmet.\nWe may not be able to retain our current executive officers or key personnel or attract and retain additional executive officers or key personnel as needed to deliver on our corporate strategy. Furthermore, the recent volatility in our stock price may undermine the use of our equity as a retention tool and may make it more difficult to retain key personnel.\nSome of our and our suppliers\u2019 workforces are represented by labor unions, which may lead to work stoppages.\nSome of the employees of our MDA business in Canada, approximately 14% of our total workforce, were represented by labor unions as of December 31, 2018. We may experience work stoppages organized by labor unions, which could adversely affect our business. We cannot predict how stable our relationships with labor unions will be or whether we will be able to meet the labor unions\u2019 requirements without impacting our financial condition. The labor unions may also limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce. Labor union actions at suppliers can also affect us. Work stoppages and instability in our relationships with labor unions could delay the production and/or development of our products, which could strain relationships with customers and cause a loss of revenues which would adversely affect our operations.\nPension and other postretirement benefit obligations may materially impact our earnings, stockholders\u2019 equity and cash flows from operations, and could have a significant adverse impacts in future periods.\nWe maintain defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefits plans for some of our employees. Potential pension contributions include discretionary contributions to improve the plans\u2019 funded status. The extent of future contributions depends heavily on market factors such as the discount rate and the actual return on plan assets. We estimate future contributions to these plans using assumptions with respect to these and other items. Changes to those assumptions could have a significant effect on future contributions, annual pension and other postretirement costs, the value of plan assets and our benefit obligations.\nSignificant changes in actual return on pension assets, discount rates, and other factors could adversely affect our results of operations and require cash pension contributions in future periods. Changes in discount rates and actual asset returns different than our expected asset returns can result in significant non-cash actuarial gains or losses which we record in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, and, if applicable, in any quarter in which an interim re-measurement is triggered. With regard to cash pension contributions, funding requirements for our pension plans are largely dependent upon interest rates, actual investment returns on pension assets and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to pension funding obligations.\nWe also provide other postretirement benefits to certain of our employees, consisting principally of health care, dental and life insurance for eligible retirees and qualifying dependents. Our estimates of future costs associated with these benefits are also subject to assumptions, including estimates of the level of medical cost increases and discount rates.\nFor a discussion regarding how our financial statements can be affected by pension and other postretirement plan accounting policies, see Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe are a party to legal proceedings, investigations and other claims or disputes, which are costly to defend and, if determined adversely to us, could require us to pay fines or damages, undertake remedial measures or prevent us from taking certain actions, any of which could adversely affect our business.\nIn the course of our business, we are, and in the future may be, a party to legal proceedings, investigations and other claims or disputes, which have related and may relate to subjects including commercial transactions, intellectual property, securities, employee relations, or compliance with applicable laws and regulations. For instance, we are currently engaged in an arbitration proceeding relating to the termination of a contract with a Ukrainian customer in response to the force majeure event caused by the annexation of Crimea. While we believe that the claim against us is without merit and that it has factual and legal defenses to the petitioner\u2019s claim, in the event that the arbitration results in a finding against us, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, in the first quarter of 2019, we became subject to certain securities class action litigation as a result of volatility in the price of our common stock, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources and could harm our stock price, business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition. See Part I, Item 3, \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nThese and other legal proceedings and investigations are inherently uncertain and we cannot predict their duration, scope, outcome or consequences. There can be no assurance that these or any such matters that have been or may in the future be brought against us will be resolved favorably.\nIn connection with any government investigations, in the event the government takes action against us or the parties resolve or settle the matter, we may be required to pay substantial fines or civil and criminal penalties and/or be subject to equitable remedies, including disgorgement or injunctive relief. Other legal or regulatory proceedings, including lawsuits filed by private litigants, may also follow as a consequence. These matters are likely to be expensive and time-consuming to defend, settle and/or resolve, and may require us to implement certain remedial measures that could prove costly or disruptive to our business and operations. They may also cause damage to our business reputation. The unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nWe may not realize all of the anticipated benefits from the U.S. Domestication.\nWe believe that we will continue to capitalize on projected benefits resulting from completion of the U.S. Domestication. Over the past several years, we have invested a significant amount of capital to develop infrastructure, technologies, products and markets to better access the U.S. government in both the civilian and military/classified space. Failure to realize all of the anticipated benefits from the U.S. Domestication could have a material adverse effect on our U.S. government business and prospects moving forward, including future EnhancedView awards and fully realizing our U.S. Access Plan. Similarly, there can be no guarantee that our historical ability to secure business in Canada will be unaffected by the U.S. Domestication.\nFluctuations in foreign exchange rates could have a negative impact on our business.\nOur revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars for the purposes of compiling our consolidated financial statements. We use hedging strategies to manage and minimize the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our cash flow and economic profits. There are complexities inherent in determining whether and when foreign exchange exposures will materialize, in particular given the possibility of unpredictable revenue variations arising from schedule delays and contract postponements. Furthermore, we could be exposed to the risk of non-performance of our hedging counterparties. We may also have difficulty in fully implementing our hedging strategy depending on the willingness of hedging counterparties to extend credit. Accordingly, no assurances may be given that our exchange rate hedging strategy will protect us from significant changes or fluctuations in revenues and expenses denominated in non-Canadian or U.S. dollars.\nOur restructuring activities and cost saving initiatives may not achieve the results we anticipate.\nWe have undertaken cost reduction initiatives and organizational restructurings to improve operating efficiencies, optimize our asset base and generate cost savings. For example, we have recently undertaken restructuring plans intended to reduce headcount and implement other efficiency initiatives. We cannot be certain that we will be able to complete these initiatives as planned or without business interruption, that these initiatives will not generate additional costs, such as severance or other charges, or that the estimated operating efficiencies or cost savings from such activities will be fully realized or maintained over time.\nFuture acquisitions could result in adverse impacts on our operations.\nIn order to grow our business, we may seek to acquire additional assets or companies. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify, acquire, obtain the required regulatory approvals, or profitably manage additional businesses or successfully integrate any acquired businesses, products or technologies without substantial expenses, delays or other\noperational, regulatory, or financial problems. In addition, any acquired businesses, products or technologies may not achieve anticipated revenues and income growth. Further, acquisitions may involve a number of additional risks, including diversion of management\u2019s attention, failure to retain key personnel, or failure to attract the right talent to manage organizational growth. We may become responsible for unexpected liabilities that we failed or were unable to discover in the course of performing due diligence in connection with historical acquisitions and any future acquisitions. The failure to manage our acquisitions strategy successfully could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters\nOur operations in the U.S. government market are subject to significant regulatory risk.\nOur operations in the U.S. government market are subject to significant government regulation. The costs associated with execution of our U.S. Access Plan are significant. A failure by us to maintain the relevant clearances and approvals could limit our ability to operate in the U.S. market. Further, there can be no assurance that we will continue to be awarded contracts by the U.S. government. In addition, a failure by us to keep current and compliant with relevant U.S. regulations could result in fines, penalties, repayments, or suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time and could have an adverse effect on our standing and eligibility for future U.S. government contracts.\nFailure to comply with the requirements of the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual could result in interruption, delay or suspension of our ability to provide our products and services, and could result in loss of current and future business with the U.S. government.\nWe and our subsidiaries are parties to certain contracts with various departments and agencies of the U.S. government, including the U.S. Department of Defense, which require that certain of our subsidiaries (including SSL, DigitalGlobe and subsidiaries within the Services segment) be issued facility security clearances under the National Industrial Security Program. The National Industrial Security Program requires that a corporation maintaining a facility security clearance be effectively insulated from foreign ownership, control or influence (\u201cFOCI\u201d). Prior to the U.S. Domestication, we were incorporated under the laws of Canada, and had entered into a Security Control Agreement, dated January 26, 2017, by and among us, our wholly owned subsidiary, Maxar Technologies Holdings Inc. (\u201cMaxar Holdings\u201d) and the U.S. Department of Defense (the \u201cSCA\u201d), as a suitable FOCI mitigation arrangement under the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual. A FOCI mitigation arrangement was necessary for certain of our U.S. subsidiaries, including SSL, DigitalGlobe and subsidiaries within the Services segment, to acquire and continue to maintain the requisite facility security clearances thereby enabling them to enter into contracts with U.S. government entities to perform classified work and to complete the performance under those contracts. Following U.S. Domestication, we are seeking to modify or terminate our FOCI mitigation arrangement with the U.S. Department of Defense. In the meantime, failure to maintain an appropriate agreement with the U.S. Department of Defense regarding the appropriate FOCI mitigation arrangement could result in invalidation or termination of the facility security clearances, which in turn would mean that our U.S. subsidiaries would not be able to enter into future contracts with the U.S. government requiring facility security clearances, and may result in the loss of the ability of those subsidiaries to complete existing contracts with the U.S. government.\nOur business is subject to various regulatory risks that could adversely affect our operations.\nThe environment in which we operate is highly regulated due to the sensitive nature of our complex and technologically advanced systems, including satellites, products, hardware and software, in addition to those regulations broadly applicable to publicly listed corporations. There are numerous regulatory risks that could adversely affect operations, including but not limited to:\n\u00b7\nChanges in laws and regulations. It is possible that the laws and regulations governing our business and operations will change in the future. A substantial portion of our revenue is generated from customers outside of Canada and the U.S. There may be a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations if we are required to alter our business to comply with changes in both domestic and foreign\nregulations, telecommunications standards, tariffs or taxes and other trade barriers that reduce or restrict our ability to sell our products and services on a global basis, or by political and economic instability in the countries in which we conduct business. Any failure to comply with such regulatory requirements could also subject us to various penalties or sanctions.\n\u00b7\nExport Restrictions. Certain of our businesses and satellites, systems, products, services or technologies we have developed require the implementation or acquisition of products or technologies from third parties, including those in other jurisdictions. In addition, certain of our satellites, systems, products or technologies may be required to be forwarded or exported to other jurisdictions. In certain cases, if the use of the technologies can be viewed by the jurisdiction in which that supplier or subcontractor resides as being subject to export constraints or restrictions relating to national security, we may not be able to obtain the technologies and products that we require from subcontractors who would otherwise be our preferred choice or may not be able to obtain the export permits necessary to transfer or export our technology. To the extent that we are able, we obtain pre-authorization for re-export prior to signing contracts which oblige us to export subject technologies, including specific foreign government approval as needed. In the event of export restrictions, we may have the ability through contract force majeure provisions to be excused from our obligations. Notwithstanding these provisions, the inability to obtain export approvals, export restrictions or changes during contract execution or non-compliance by our customers could have an adverse effect on our revenues and margins.\n\u00b7\nU.S. Government Approval Requirements. For certain aspects of our business operations, we are required to obtain U.S. government licenses and approvals and to enter into agreements with various government bodies in order to export satellites and related equipment, to disclose technical data or provide defense services to foreign persons. The delayed receipt of or the failure to obtain the necessary U.S. government licenses, approvals and agreements may prohibit entry into or interrupt the completion of contracts which could lead to a customer\u2019s termination of a contract for default, monetary penalties and/or the loss of incentive payments.\n\u00b7\nCompetitive Impact of U.S. Regulations on Satellite Sales. Some of our customers and potential customers, along with insurance underwriters and brokers, have asserted that U.S. export control laws and regulations governing disclosures to foreign persons excessively restrict their access to information about the satellite during construction and on-orbit. Office of Foreign Assets Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d) sanctions and requirements may also limit certain business opportunities or delay or restrict our ability to contract with potential foreign customers or operators. To the extent that our non-U.S. competitors are not subject to OFAC or similar export control or economic sanctions laws and regulations, they may enjoy a competitive advantage with foreign customers, and it could become increasingly difficult for the U.S. satellite manufacturing industry, including us, to recapture this lost market share. Customers concerned over the possibility that the U.S. government may deny the export license necessary for us to deliver their purchased satellite to them, or the restrictions or delays imposed by the U.S. government licensing requirements, even where an export license is granted, may elect to choose a satellite that is purportedly free of International Traffic in Arms Regulations (\u201cITAR\u201d) offered by one of our European competitors. We are further disadvantaged by the fact that a purportedly \u201cITAR-free\u201d satellite may be launched less expensively in China on the Chinese Long March rocket, a launch vehicle that, because of ITAR restrictions, is not available to us.\n\u00b7\nAnti-Corruption Laws. As part of the regulatory and legal environments in which we operate, we are subject to global anti-corruption laws that prohibit improper payments directly or indirectly to government officials, authorities or persons defined in those anti-corruption laws in order to obtain or retain business or other improper advantages in the conduct of business. Our policies mandate compliance with anti-corruption laws. Failure by our employees, agents, subcontractors, suppliers and/or partners to comply with anti-corruption laws could impact us in various ways that include, but are not limited to, criminal, civil and administrative fines and/or legal sanctions and the inability to bid for or enter into contracts with certain entities, all of which could have a significant adverse effect on our reputation, operations and financial results.\nChanges in tax law, in our tax rates or in exposure to additional income tax liabilities or assessments may materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nChanges in law and policy relating to taxes may materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. For example, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \u201c2017 Tax Act\u201d), which has significantly changed the U.S. federal income taxation of U.S. corporations, including by reducing the U.S. corporate income tax rate, limiting interest deductions and certain deductions for executive compensation, permitting immediate expensing of certain capital expenditures, adopting elements of a territorial tax system, revising the rules governing net operating losses, and introducing new anti-base erosion and global intangible low-taxed income inclusion provisions. Many of these changes were effective immediately, without any transition periods or grandfathering for existing transactions. The 2017 Tax Act remains unclear in many respects and could be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections, as well as interpretations and implementing regulations by the Treasury and United States Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d), any of which could lessen or increase certain adverse impacts of the 2017 Tax Act. In addition, it is unclear how these U.S. federal income tax changes will affect state and local taxation, which often uses federal taxable income as a starting point for computing state and local tax liabilities. We could be subject to tax audits, challenges to our tax positions or adverse changes or interpretations of tax laws. Adverse positions taken by tax authorities and tax audits could impact our operating results.\nWhile our analysis and interpretation of the 2017 Tax Act is ongoing, based on our current evaluation, the limitation on interest deductions, and anti-base erosion and global intangible low-taxed income inclusion provisions may negatively impact our cash flows going forward. Further, there may be other material adverse effects resulting from the 2017 Tax Act that we have not yet identified, including as a result of and following the U.S. Domestication. While some of the changes made by the 2017 Tax Act may adversely affect us in one or more reporting periods and prospectively, other changes may be beneficial on a going forward basis. We continue to work with our tax advisors and auditors to determine the full impact that the 2017 Tax Act as a whole will have on us.\nOur ability to use our U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had U.S. federal and state net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforwards as well as tax credit carryforwards related to research and development expenditures.\nUnder Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change U.S. federal NOL carryforwards and other tax attributes (such as research tax credits) to offset its post-change income and taxes may be limited. In general, an \u201cownership change\u201d occurs if there is a greater than 50 percentage point change (by value) in a corporation\u2019s equity ownership by certain stockholders over a rolling three-year period. Similar provisions of state tax law may also apply to limit our use of accumulated state tax attributes. In the event that we have experienced an ownership change in the past, or if we experience ownership changes as a result of future transactions in our stock, then our ability to use pre-change NOL carryforwards and other tax attributes to offset post-change taxable income will be subject to limitations. As a result, we may be unable to use a material portion of our NOL carryforwards and other tax attributes, which could adversely affect our future cash flows.\nAdditionally, the 2017 Tax Act changed the rules governing the use of U.S. federal NOLs, including by imposing a reduction to the maximum deduction allowed for NOLs generated in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. In addition, NOL carryforwards arising in tax years ending after December 31, 2017 can be carried forward indefinitely, but carryback is generally prohibited. Such limitations may significantly impact our ability to use NOL carryforwards generated after December 31, 2017, as well as the timing of any such use, and could adversely affect our future cash flows.\nWe are incurring increased costs and demands in order to comply with laws and regulations applicable to public companies.\nWe became a \u201cdomestic issuer\u201d for SEC reporting purposes in January 2019. The obligations of being a public company in the U.S. require significant expenditures and will place significant demands on our management and other personnel, including costs resulting from public company reporting obligations under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations regarding corporate governance practices, including those under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and the listing requirements of the NYSE and the TSX. These rules require that we maintain effective disclosure and financial controls and procedures, internal control over financial reporting and changes in corporate governance practices, among many other complex rules that are often difficult to monitor and maintain compliance with. Our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to ensure compliance with all of these requirements and to keep pace with new regulations, otherwise we may fall out of compliance and risk becoming subject to reputational damage, litigation or being delisted, among other potential problems.\nWe have material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting and cannot assure you that additional material weaknesses will not be identified in the future. Our failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in material misstatements in our financial statements which could require us to restate financial statements, cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and have a negative effect on our stock price.\nManagement has identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as defined in the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board\u2019s Auditing Standard No. 2 that affected our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018. No material errors were identified in the financial statements as a result of the material weaknesses. See Part II, Item 9A, \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d for more information.\nWe cannot assure you that additional significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will not be identified in the future. Any failure to maintain or implement required new or improved controls, or any difficulties we encounter in their implementation, could result in additional significant deficiencies or material weaknesses, cause us to fail to meet our periodic reporting obligations or result in material misstatements in our financial statements. Any such failure could also adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual auditor attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules promulgated under Section 404. The existence of a material weakness could result in errors in our financial statements that could result in a restatement of financial statements, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, leading to a decline in our stock price. In addition, if we fail to maintain effective internal controls, we might be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC or the NYSE.\nOur operations are subject to governmental law and regulations relating to environmental matters, which may expose us to significant costs and liabilities that could negatively impact our financial condition.\nWe are subject to various federal, state, provincial and local environmental laws and regulations relating to the operation of our businesses, including those governing pollution, the handling, storage, disposal and transportation of hazardous substances, and the ownership and operation of real property. We have been designated, along with numerous other companies, as a potentially responsible party for the cleanup of hazardous waste on certain sites where we operate and there can be no assurance that the previous owners of those properties strictly complied with such environmental laws and regulations. Such laws and regulations may result in significant liabilities and costs to us due to the actions or inactions of the previous owners. In addition, new laws and regulations, more stringent enforcement of existing laws and regulations or the discovery of previously unknown contamination could result in additional costs.\nOur international business exposes us to risks relating to increased regulation, currency fluctuations, and political or economic instability in foreign markets, which could adversely affect our revenue.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2018, approximately 29% of our revenue was derived from non-U.S. or Canadian sales, and we intend to continue to pursue international contracts. International operations are subject to certain risks, such as: changes in domestic and foreign governmental regulations and licensing requirements; deterioration of relations between the U.S. and/or Canada and a particular foreign country; increases in tariffs and taxes and other trade barriers; foreign currency fluctuations; changes in political and economic stability; effects of austerity programs or similar significant budget reduction programs; potential preferences by prospective customers to purchase from local (non-U.S. or Canadian) sources; and difficulties in obtaining or enforcing judgments in foreign jurisdictions.\nIn addition, our international contracts may include industrial cooperation agreements requiring specific in-country purchases, investments, manufacturing agreements or other financial obligations, known as offset obligations, and provide for penalties if we fail to meet such requirements. The impact of these factors is difficult to predict, but one or more of them could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOur operations in the United Kingdom and Europe may pose additional risks to our profitability and operating results.\nFollowing a referendum on June 23, 2016 in which voters in the United Kingdom (\u201cU.K.\u201d) approved an exit from the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d), the U.K. government has initiated a process to leave the EU (often referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d), including negotiating the terms of the U.K.\u2019s future relationship with the EU. Such an exit from the EU is unprecedented, and it is unclear how the U.K.\u2019s access to the EU Single Market, and the wider commercial, legal and regulatory environment, will impact our U.K. and European operations and customers. Our U.K. operations service customers in the U.K. as well as in other countries in the EU, and these operations could be disrupted by Brexit, particularly if there is a change in the U.K.\u2019s relationship to the EU Single Market. While the full scope of implementation of the referendum decision is still unclear, companies exposed to or with operations in the U.K., such as ours, may face significant regulatory changes as a result of Brexit implementation, and complying with such new regulatory mandates may prove challenging and costly. The announcement of Brexit has created economic uncertainty surrounding the terms of the U.K.\u2019s exit and its consequences could adversely impact customer confidence resulting in customers reducing their spending budgets on our products and services, which would adversely affect our businesses and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness and Our Common Stock\nOur business is capital intensive, and we may not be able to raise adequate capital to finance our business strategies, including funding future satellites, or we may be able to do so only on terms that significantly restrict our ability to operate our business.\nThe implementation of our business strategies, such as expanding our satellite constellation and our products and services offerings, requires a substantial outlay of capital. As we pursue our business strategies and seek to respond to opportunities and trends in our industry, our actual capital expenditures may differ from our expected capital expenditures, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to satisfy our capital requirements in the future. We are highly leveraged, but we currently expect that our ongoing liquidity requirements for sustaining our operations will be satisfied by cash on hand and cash generated from our existing and future operations supplemented, where necessary, by available credit. However, we cannot provide assurances that our businesses will generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future or that additional capital will be available in amounts sufficient to enable us to execute our business strategies. Our ability to increase our debt financing and/or renew existing credit facilities may be limited by our existing financial covenants, credit objectives, or the conditions of the debt capital market generally. Furthermore, our current financing arrangements contain certain restrictive covenants (e.g., the achievement or maintenance of stated financial ratios) that may impact our access to those facilities and significantly limit future operating and financial flexibility.\nOur ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing or government grants to finance operating working capital requirements and growth initiatives may be limited or difficult to obtain, which could adversely affect our operations and financial condition.\nWe need capital to finance operating working capital requirements and growth initiatives and to pay our outstanding debt obligations as they become due for payment. If the cash generated from our businesses, together with the credit available under existing bank facilities, is not sufficient to fund future capital requirements, we will require additional debt or equity financing. Our ability to access capital markets on terms that are acceptable to us will be dependent on prevailing market conditions, as well as our future financial condition. Further, our ability to increase our debt financing and/or renew existing facilities may be limited by our existing leverage, financial covenants, credit objectives, and debt capital market conditions.\nWe have in the past, and may continue in the future to, receive government grants for research and development activities and other business initiatives. Any agreement or grant of this nature with government may be accompanied by contractual obligations applicable to us, which may result in the grant money becoming repayable if certain requirements are not met. A failure to meet contractual obligations under such agreements and grants and a consequent requirement to repay money received could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur substantial indebtedness and other contractual obligations could adversely affect our financial condition, our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, our ability to operate our business, our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and our ability to pay our debts and could divert our cash flow from operations for debt payments.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness and leverage. As of December 31, 2018, the carrying value of our long-term debt was $3,047 million. This level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay the principal of, interest on, or other amounts due with respect to our indebtedness. Our long-term debt bears interest at floating rates related to U.S. LIBOR (for U.S. dollar borrowings) and CDOR or Canadian Bankers\u2019 Acceptances (for Canadian dollar borrowings), plus a margin. As a result, our interest payment obligations on such indebtedness will increase if such interest rates increase. Our leverage and debt service obligations could adversely impact our business, including by:\n\u00b7\nimpairing our ability to meet one or more of the financial ratios contained in our credit facilities or to generate cash sufficient to pay interest or principal, including periodic principal payments;\n\u00b7\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u00b7\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms, if at all;\n\u00b7\nrequiring the dedication of a portion of our cash flow from operations to service our debt, thereby reducing the amount of our cash flow available for other purposes, including capital expenditures, dividends to stockholders or to pursue future business opportunities;\n\u00b7\nrequiring us to sell debt or equity securities or to sell some of our core assets, possibly on unfavorable terms, to meet payment obligations;\n\u00b7\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we compete; and\n\u00b7\nplacing us at a possible competitive disadvantage with less leveraged competitors and competitors that may have better access to capital resources.\nAny of the forgoing factors could have negative consequences on our financial condition and results of operation.\nOur current financing arrangements contain certain restrictive covenants that impact our future operating and financial flexibility.\nOur current financing arrangements contain certain restrictive covenants that impact our future operating and financial flexibility. Our debt funding is provided under our credit agreements, which contains a series of positive and negative covenants with which we must comply, including the achievement or maintenance of stated financial ratios. If we fail to\ncomply with any covenants and are unable to obtain a waiver thereof, the lenders under the senior secured syndicated credit facility (the \u201cSyndicated Credit Facility\u201d) may be able to take certain actions with respect to the amounts owing under such agreements, including early payment thereof. Any such actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. These covenants could also have the effect of limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the markets in which we compete.\nThere can be no assurance that we will pay dividends on our common stock.\nAlthough our Board of Directors has historically declared a quarterly cash dividend which we have paid, the payment of future dividends is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, and we may not pay quarterly dividends in the same amounts or at all in the future. The declaration, amount and timing of cash dividends are subject to capital availability and determinations by our Board of Directors that such dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all respective laws and applicable agreements. Our ability to pay dividends will depend upon, among other factors, our cash balances and potential future capital requirements for strategic transactions, including acquisitions, debt service requirements, results of operations, financial condition and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. On February 27, 2019, the Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.01 per common share payable on March 29, 2019 to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 15, 2019. The elimination of our dividend payments and/or our dividend program could have a material negative effect on our stock price.\nWe could be adversely impacted by actions of activist stockholders, and such activism could impact the value of our securities.\nWe value constructive input from our stockholders and the investment community. However, there is no assurance that the actions taken by our Board of Directors and management in seeking to maintain constructive engagement with our stockholders will be successful. Certain of our stockholders have expressed views with respect to the operation of our business, our business strategy, corporate governance considerations or other matters. Responding to actions by activist stockholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupting our operations and diverting the attention of management and our employees. The perceived uncertainties as to our future direction due to activist actions could affect the market price of our stock, result in the loss of potential business opportunities and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel, board members and business partners.\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile and fluctuate substantially.\nOur common stock is listed on the NYSE and the TSX and the price for our common stock has historically been volatile. The market price of our common stock may continue to be highly volatile and may fluctuate substantially due to the following factors (in addition to the other risk factors described in this section):\n\u00b7\ngeneral economic conditions;\n\u00b7\nfluctuations in our operating results;\n\u00b7\nvariance in our financial performance from the expectations of equity and/or debt research analysts;\n\u00b7\nconditions and trends in the markets we serve;\n\u00b7\nadditions of or changes to key employees;\n\u00b7\nchanges in market valuations or earnings of our competitors;\n\u00b7\ntrading volumes of our common stock;\n\u00b7\nfuture sales of our equity securities and/or future issuances of indebtedness;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the estimation of the future sizes and growth rates of our markets; and\n\u00b7\nlegislation or regulatory policies, practices or actions.\nIn addition, the stock markets in general have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have at times been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the particular companies affected. These market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of our common stock irrespective of our operating performance.\nThe market price of our common stock recently experienced a significant decline from which it has not fully recovered. A significant or prolonged decrease in our market capitalization, including a decline in stock price, or a negative long-\nterm performance outlook, could result in an impairment of our assets which results when the carrying value of our assets exceed their fair value.\nIn addition, in the first quarter of 2019, we became subject to certain securities class action litigation as a result of volatility in the price of our common stock, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources and could harm our stock price, business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition. See Part I, Item 3, \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nTechniques employed by short sellers may drive down the market price of our common stock.\nShort selling is the practice of selling securities that the seller does not own, but rather has borrowed from a third-party with the intention of buying identical securities back at a later date to return to the lender. The short seller hopes to profit from a decline in the value of the securities between the sale of the borrowed securities and the purchase of the replacement shares, as the short seller expects to pay less in that purchase than it received in the sale. As it is in the short seller\u2019s best interests for the price of the stock to decline, many short sellers publish, or arrange for the publication of, negative opinions regarding the relevant issuer and its business prospects in order to create negative market momentum and generate profits for themselves after selling a stock short. These short attacks have, in the past, led to selling of shares in the market. In the past several years, our securities have been the subject of short selling. Reports and information have been published about us that we believe are mischaracterized or incorrect, and which have in the past been followed by a decline in our stock price.\nIt is not clear what additional effects the negative publicity will have on us, if any, other than potentially affecting the market price of our common stock. If we continue to be the subject of unfavorable allegations, we may have to expend a significant amount of resources to investigate such allegations and/or defend ourselves. While we would strongly defend against any such short seller attacks, we may be constrained in the manner in which we can proceed against the relevant short seller by applicable state law or issues of commercial confidentiality. Such a situation could be costly and time-consuming, and could be distracting for our management team. Additionally, such allegations against us could negatively impact our business operations and stockholders' equity, and the value of any investment in our stock could be reduced.\nIf securities or industry analysts discontinue publishing research or reports about our business, or publish negative reports about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us, our business, our market and our competitors. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or change their opinion of our stock, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws may impede or\ndiscourage a takeover, changes in management or changes in the Board of Directors, which could reduce the market price of our common stock.\nCertain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws may delay or prevent a third-party from acquiring control of us, even if a change in control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. These provisions include:\n\u00b7\nno cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u00b7\nthe exclusive right of the Board of Directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the Board of Directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on the Board of Directors;\n\u00b7\nthe ability of the Board of Directors to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer;\n\u00b7\na prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of stockholders;\n\u00b7\nthe requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by the chairman of the Board of Directors or two or more stockholders who hold, in the aggregate, at least ten percent (10%) of the voting power of our outstanding shares, which may delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors; and\n\u00b7\nadvance notice procedures that stockholders must comply with in order to nominate candidates to the Board of Directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our business.\nThese provisions could impede a merger, takeover or other business combination involving us or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our common stock, which, under certain circumstances, could reduce the market price of our common stock. In addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation requires, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that derivative actions brought in our name, actions against our directors, officers and employees for breach of fiduciary duty and other similar actions may be brought only in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware.\nOur actual operating results may differ significantly from our guidance.\nFrom time to time, we release guidance regarding our future performance that represents our management\u2019s estimates as of the date of release. This guidance, which consists of forward-looking statements, is prepared by our management and is qualified by, and subject to, the assumptions and the other information contained or referred to in the release. Our guidance is not prepared with a view toward compliance with published guidelines of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and neither any independent registered public accounting firm nor any other independent expert or outside party compiles, examines or reviews the guidance and, accordingly, no such person expresses any opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto.\nGuidance is based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that, while presented with numerical specificity, is inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control and are based upon specific assumptions with respect to future business decisions, some of which will change. We generally state possible outcomes as high and low ranges which are intended to provide a sensitivity analysis as variables are changed but are not intended to represent that actual results could not fall outside of these ranges. The principal reason that we release this data is to provide a basis for our management to discuss our business outlook with analysts and investors. We do not accept any responsibility for any projections or reports published by any such persons.\nGuidance is necessarily speculative in nature, and it can be expected that some or all of the assumptions of the guidance furnished by us will not materialize or will vary significantly from actual results, particularly any guidance relating to the results of operations of acquired businesses or companies as our management will be less familiar with their business, procedures and operations. Accordingly, our guidance is only an estimate of what management believes is realizable as of the date of release. Actual results will vary from the guidance and the variations may be material. Investors should also recognize that the reliability of any forecasted financial data will diminish the farther in the future that the data are forecast. In light of the foregoing, investors are urged to put the guidance in context and not to place undue reliance on it.\nAny failure to successfully implement our operating strategy or the occurrence of any of the events or circumstances set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K could result in the actual operating results being different than the guidance, and such differences may be adverse and material.", "PERMNO": 16939, "SIC": 3663, "TIC": "MAXR"}
