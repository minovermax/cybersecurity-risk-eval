{"cik": "906780", "company": "EMPIRE RESORTS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-10", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors.\nRisks Relating to our Business\nWe will require additional financing in order to develop the Casino Project, pursue a Gaming Facility License and to finance matters related to the Casino Project and we may be unable to meet our future capital requirements and execute our business strategy without such financing.\nBecause we are unable to generate sufficient cash from our operations to develop the Casino Project, we will be required to rely on external financing. In order to participate in the Adelaar Project and to meet our obligations with respect to the development of the Casino Project, we have agreed to invest a minimum of $300 million. On January 5, 2015, the Company commenced the January 2015 Rights Offering to raise capital in the short-term to fund the immediate expenses of the Casino Project, which may include permitting, infrastructure and shared master planning costs and expenses, as well as other costs associated with pursuing a Gaming Facility License and to finance matters related to the Casino Project's development. We will require additional capital resources to fund the Casino Project. In addition, we will require additional capital resources in the event we are awarded a Gaming Facility License, for which purpose we may seek to enter into strategic agreements, joint ventures or similar agreements or we may sell additional debt or equity in public or private transactions, including pursuant to the terms of the Commitment Letter with Kien Huat, as amended. Such transactions may include private offerings, underwritten or \"best efforts\" offerings to the public or additional rights offerings to current stockholders. We can make no assurance that financing will be available in amounts or on acceptable terms, if at all, which may adversely impact our ability to pursue the development of the Casino Project.\nThe external financing to support the Adelaar Project and the Casino Project, pursuing a Gaming Facility License and matters related to the Casino Project may include a debt offering. Credit Suisse AG has committed to provide a senior secured credit facility of up to a maximum amount of $478 million (the \u201cCS Credit Facility\u201d). Depending on a variety of factors outside the control of the Company, the amount of financing needed for the Casino Project may be less than the maximum amount of the commitment. The CS Credit Facility is subject to various conditions precedent, including the Company\u2019s receipt of a Gaming Facility License and evidence of an equity investment in the Company of up to $150 million, $50 million of which has been raised in the January 2015 Rights Offering.\nThe level of indebtedness will likely have several important effects on future operations, including, without limitation:\n\u2022\na portion of cash flow from current operations may be dedicated to the payment of any interest and/or principal required with respect to outstanding indebtedness while we are developing the Casino Project or pursuing a Gaming Facility License;\n\u2022\nthe debt documents may contain restrictive covenants curtailing operations and finances;\n\u2022\nincreases in outstanding indebtedness and leverage may increase vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions, as well as to competitive pressure;\n\u2022\ndepending on the levels of outstanding indebtedness, our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, general corporate and other purposes may be limited, and\n\u2022\ncovenants may restrict dividends and transfer of funds from the operating entity to Empire.\nThe ability to make payments of principal and interest on indebtedness will depend upon future performance, which is subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles and financial, business and other factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control. If sufficient cash flow is not generated from operations to service such debt, requirements among other things, may be to:\n\u2022\nseek additional financing in the debt or equity markets;\n\u2022\ndelay, curtail or abandon altogether our development plans;\n\u2022\nrefinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness; or\n\u2022\nsell selected assets.\nSuch measures might be insufficient to service the indebtedness. In addition, any such financing, refinancing or sale of assets may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nAlternatively, the external financing to support the Adelaar Project and the Casino Project and pursuing our Gaming Facility License may be in the form of an equity offering of our equity capital stock, including a \"shelf takedown\" from the registration statement we filed on Form S-3. Such future sales of substantial amounts of equity capital stock privately or in the public market, the sale of shares held by Kien Huat or the conversion of the Kien Huat Note (as defined below) held by Kien Huat into shares of common stock, or the perception that such sales or conversion are likely to occur, could affect the market\nprice of the common stock. Moreover, the sale of additional equity could result in significant dilution to the existing stockholders. In addition, securities issued in connection with future financing activities or potential acquisitions may have rights and preferences senior to the rights and preferences of the common stock.\nIf funds are not available when needed, or available on acceptable terms, we may be required to delay, scale back or eliminate some of our obligations with respect to the Adelaar Project and our Casino Project. In addition, we may not be able to grow market share, take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements, which could negatively impact our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe may launch a rights offering to our existing equity holders in an amount necessary to meet the equity investment requirements of the CS Credit Facility and to redeem certain outstanding Series E preferred stock of the Company in accordance with an existing settlement agreement. On June 26, 2014, the Company and Kien Huat, entered into a letter agreement (the \"Commitment Letter\") pursuant to which Kien Huat committed to exercise its proportionate share of subscription rights if the Company commenced a rights offering on the terms described in the Commitment Letter to meet the requirements of the CS Credit Facility. In addition, in lieu of exercising any over-subscription rights in such a rights offering, Kien Huat agreed it would enter into a standby purchase agreement to exercise all subscription rights not otherwise exercised by other holders in the rights offering upon the same terms as the other holders. For such commitment, the Company agreed to pay Kien Huat a fee of 1.0% of the maximum amount that may be raised, of which 0.5% was paid upon execution of the Commitment Letter and the remaining 0.5% is due if a rights offering is launched.\nThe Company obtained the commitment with respect to the CS Credit Facility and entered into the Commitment Letter to meet a requirement of the application for a Gaming Facility License, which requires the Company to demonstrate its ability to finance the costs and expenses of the Casino Project. However, the Company has reserved the flexibility to reassess our financing alternatives if we are awarded a Gaming Facility License and either proceed with the financing options described herein or pursue alternative means of financing the Casino Project on terms and conditions more beneficial to the Company.\nWe may also seek to enter into other strategic agreements, joint ventures or similar agreements or we may sell additional debt or equity in public or private transactions in support of the Casino Project and our ongoing operations. On January 3, 2014, we filed the S-3, which was declared effective on February 12, 2014, covering the offer and sale of up to $250 million of our securities. As of March 6, 2015, we had up to $186.6 million available for future issuances under the S-3. The sale of additional equity will result in additional dilution to the Company\u2019s existing stockholders and financing arrangements may not be available to the Company, or may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to the Company.\nThe development costs associated with the Casino Project may increase due to significant risks inherent in construction projects.\nThe development of the Casino Project subjects us to significant risks inherent in the construction of a new facility, including unanticipated design, construction, regulatory and environmental problems. The Casino Project could also experience:\n\u2022\nchanges to plans and specifications (some of which may require the approval of the NYSGC);\n\u2022\ndelays and significant cost increases;\n\u2022\nshortages of materials;\n\u2022\nshortages of skilled labor or work stoppages for contractors and subcontractors;\n\u2022\nlabor disputes or work stoppages;\n\u2022\ndisputes with and defaults by contractors and subcontractors;\n\u2022\nhealth and safety incidents and site accidents;\n\u2022\nengineering problems, including defective plans and specifications;\n\u2022\npoor performance or nonperformance by any third parties on whom we place reliance;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws and regulations, or in the interpretation and enforcement of laws and regulations, applicable to gaming;\n\u2022\nfacilities, real estate development or construction projects;\n\u2022\nunforeseen construction scheduling, engineering, environmental, permitting, construction or geological problems;\n\u2022\nenvironmental issues, including the discovery of unknown environmental contamination;\n\u2022\nweather interference, floods, fires or other casualty losses;\n\u2022\nother unanticipated circumstances or cost increases; and\n\u2022\nfailure to obtain necessary licenses, permits, entitlements or other governmental approvals.\nThe occurrence of any of these development and construction risks could increase the total costs of the Casino Project or delay or prevent the construction or opening or otherwise affect the design and features of the Casino Project, all of which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and cause us to require additional external financing.\nIf revenues and operating income from our operations at Monticello Casino and Raceway do not increase, it could adversely affect our financial performance.\nThere can be no assurance that our current operations will draw sufficient patrons to Monticello Casino and Raceway to increase our revenues to the point that we will recognize net income. The operations and placement of our VGMs, including the layout and distribution, are under the jurisdiction of the NYSGC and the program contemplates that a significant share of the responsibility for marketing the program will be borne by the NYSGC. The NYSGC is not required to make decisions that we feel are in our best interest and, as a consequence, the profitability of our VGM operations may not reach the levels that we believe to be feasible or may be slower than expected in reaching those levels. By statute, from April 1, 2008 until March 31, 2015, 41% of gross VGM revenue is distributed to us. Unless the 2015-2016 State Budget, which we anticipate will be adopted before March 31, 2015, contains a provision to extend this share percentage of gross VGM revenue to March 31, 2016, effective as of April 1, 2015, 39% of gross VGM revenue will be distributed to us. No assurance can be given that such revenue will be sufficient to generate a profit or continue to do so. Our operations are subject to many regulatory, competitive, economic and business risks beyond our control, and a change in this regard could have a material adverse impact on our operations and our business prospects.\nAs a holding company, we are dependent on the operations of our subsidiary, MRMI, to pay dividends or make distributions in order to generate internal cash flow.\nWe are a holding company with no revenue generating operations. Consequently, our ability to meet our working capital requirements and to service our debt obligations depends on the earnings and the distribution of funds from our subsidiary. While our current operations generate sufficient cash flow to fund our obligations, there can be no assurance that the subsidiary will generate sufficient revenue to make cash distributions in an amount necessary for us to satisfy our working capital requirements or our obligations under any current or future indebtedness. In addition, the subsidiary may enter into contracts that limit or prohibit its ability to make distributions. Should our subsidiary be unable to make distributions, our ability to meet our ongoing obligations would be jeopardized. Specifically, without the making of distributions, we would be unable to pay our employees, accounting professionals or legal professionals, all of whom we rely on to manage our operations, ensure regulatory compliance and sustain our public company status.\nIf we, through Montreign, our wholly-owned subsidiary, are not awarded a Gaming Facility License, we will be in default of the Loan Agreement and our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nOn December 17, 2014, Montreign was selected in a unanimous vote by the Siting Board as the sole applicant in the Area eligible to apply to the Gaming Commission for a Gaming Facility License. The Gaming Commission will award such Gaming Facility License upon confirmation of the Company\u2019s suitability and ability to complete the Gaming Facility. However, there can be no guarantee or assurance that the Gaming Commission will award the Company a Gaming Facility License or that it will do so in a timely manner. If the Company is not awarded a Gaming Facility License, we will be in default of the Loan Agreement and our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nChanges in the laws, regulations, and ordinances (including local laws) to which the gaming industry is subject, and the application or interpretation of existing laws and regulations, or our inability or the inability of our subsidiaries, key personnel, significant stockholders, or joint venture partners to obtain or maintain required gaming regulatory licenses, permits or approvals could prevent us from pursuing future development projects or otherwise adversely impact our results of operation.\nThe ownership, management and operation of our current and any future gaming facilities are and will be subject to extensive federal, state, provincial, and/or local laws, regulations and ordinances that are administered by the relevant regulatory agency or agencies in each jurisdiction. These laws, regulations and ordinances vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but generally concern the responsibilities, financial stability and character of the owners and managers of gaming operations as well as persons financially interested or involved in gaming operations, and often require such parties to obtain certain licenses, permits and approvals. In addition, some of the licenses that we and our subsidiaries, officers, directors and principal stockholders hold expire after a relatively short period and thus require frequent renewals and reevaluations. Obtaining these licenses in the first place and the renewal process involves a subjective determination by the regulatory agencies. If we or our subsidiaries do not obtain and maintain the required licenses, permits and approvals, we may be required to divest our interest in our current or future gaming facilities or our current gaming facility risks losing its licenses. These laws, regulations and ordinances may also affect the operations of our gaming facilities or our plans in pursuing future projects.\nThe Racing, Pari-Mutuel Wagering and Breeding Law of New York State requires our stockholders to possess certain qualifications. If the NYSGC believes a stockholder does not meet their subjective determination, a stockholder may be forced to sell any stock they hold and such sale may result in a material loss of investment value for the stockholder.\nThe Racing, Pari-Mutuel Wagering and Breeding Law of New York State requires our stockholders to possess certain qualifications. A failure to possess such qualifications could lead to a material loss of investment by either us or our stockholders, as it would require divestiture of the stockholder\u2019s direct or indirect interest in us. Consequently, should any stockholder ever fail to meet the qualifications necessary to own a direct or indirect interest in us by NYSGC, such stockholder could be forced to liquidate all interests in us. Should such stockholder be forced to liquidate these interests within a relatively short period of time, such stockholder would likely be forced to sell at a discount, causing a material loss of investment value.\nDuring 2002, certain affiliates of Bryanston Group, Inc. (\u201cBryanston Group\u201d), our former largest stockholder, and certain of our other stockholders and officers (\u201cSeries E Preferred Stockholders\u201d) were indicted for various counts of tax and bank fraud. On September 5, 2003, one of these Series E Preferred Stockholders pleaded guilty to felony tax fraud, and on February 4, 2004, four additional former officers and Series E Preferred Stockholders were convicted of tax and bank fraud. None of the acts these individuals were charged with or convicted of relate to their ownership interests in us and their remaining interests do not provide them with any control in the management of the Company or MRMI. However, there can be no assurance that none of the various governmental agencies that now, or in the future may, regulate and license our gaming related activities will factor in these indictments or criminal acts in evaluating our ability to obtain or maintain required licenses, permits or approvals. Should a regulatory agency determine that the indictments and convictions of some of our Series E Preferred Stockholders affect our ability to obtain or maintain required licenses, permits or approvals, we could be forced to liquidate certain or all of our gaming interests.\nThe gaming industry in the northeastern United States is highly competitive, with many of our competitors better known and better financed than us.\nThe gaming industry in the northeastern United States is highly competitive and increasingly dominated by multinational corporations or Native American tribes that enjoy widespread name recognition, established brand loyalty, decades of casino operation experience, and a diverse portfolio of gaming assets and substantially greater financial resources.\nWe face competition for our VGM operations from Yonkers Raceway which is located within the New York City metropolitan area. The Yonkers facility, which is much closer to New York City, has a harness horseracing facility, approximately 5,300 VGMs, food and beverage outlets and other amenities. In contrast, we have limited financial resources and currently operate our harness horse racing facility and VGMs in Monticello, New York, which is approximately a one and a half hour drive from New York City.\nPennsylvania casinos may operate table games and slot machines, have the ability to grant credit to guests of the casino and have the ability to award an unlimited amount of non-taxable free play to their guests. Pennsylvania legalized the operation of up to 61,000 slot machines at 14 locations throughout the state. As of March 2015, there were twelve casinos in operation within Pennsylvania, with six located at race tracks. One such racetrack facility is the Mohegan Sun at Pocono Downs, which has approximately 2,300 slot machines and 87 table games, including 18 poker tables, and a hotel and spa that opened in November 2013. The Mohegan Sun at Pocono Downs in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, is approximately 70 miles southwest of Monticello. In addition, the Mount Airy Casino Resort has approximately 1,870 slot machines and 80 table games, including 9 poker tables, a hotel, spa, and a golf course. The Mount Airy Casino Resort is located in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania, approximately 60 miles southwest of Monticello. Any expansion of these casinos in Pennsylvania will likely increase the degree of competition within our market and may have an adverse effect on our business and future operating performance.\nNo assurance can be given that we will be able to compete successfully for gaming customers with the established casinos in Pennsylvania or the competing VGM facility at Yonkers Raceway.\nIn combination with existing and proposed Native American casinos in New York State, the Casino Project, if built, will face intense competition that may adversely impact our ability to meet our development goals.\nA number of Native American tribes and gaming entrepreneurs are seeking to develop Class III casinos in New York and Connecticut in areas that are 90 miles from New York City such as Bridgeport, Connecticut and Southampton, New York. We are unable to predict when or if any gaming compacts will be submitted to the United States Department of the Interior or whether taking land into trust for the purpose of Class III casinos will require an Act of Congress. Based on proximity, a gaming facility, which would include a casino, hotel, restaurants and retail shops, could likely significantly increase the competition we face and have a material adverse effect on our business operations and future performance.\nThe continuing decline in the popularity of horse racing and increasing competition in simulcasting could adversely impact the business of Monticello Casino and Raceway.\nSince the mid-1980s, there has been a general decline in the number of people attending and wagering at live horse races at North American racetracks due to a number of factors, including increased competition from other forms of gaming, unwillingness of guests to travel a significant distance to racetracks and the increasing availability of off-track wagering. The declining attendance at live horse racing events has prompted racetracks to rely increasingly on revenues from inter-track, off-track and account wagering markets. The industry-wide focus on inter-track, off-track and account wagering markets has increased competition among racetracks for outlets to simulcast their live races. As a result of the lack of an agreement between MRMI and the MHHA from February 1, 2014 to July 20, 2014, and because the federal Interstate Horseracing Act required a written agreement which includes the horsemen's permission to simulcast into and out of New York, our simulcasting operations to and from locations outside New York State were suspended for approximately six (6) months, which adversely impacted the results of racing operations. In 2014, 2013 and 2012, we generated approximately $1.8 million, $4.0 million and $3.6 million, respectively, of revenues from the import and export simulcasting of out-of-state racing, of which approximately $900,000, $2.0 million and $1.8 million, respectively, were due to the horsemen. A continued decrease in attendance at live events and in on-track wagering, as well as increased competition in the inter-track, off-track and account wagering markets, could lead to a decrease in the amount wagered at Monticello Casino and Raceway. Our business plan anticipates the possibility of Monticello Casino and Raceway attracting new guests to our racetrack wagering operations through VGMs in order to offset the general decline in raceway attendance. However, even if our VGM operations attract new guests to our racetrack, we may not be able to generate profit from operations. Public tastes are unpredictable and subject to change. Any further decline in interest in horse racing or any change in public tastes may adversely affect our revenues and, therefore, limit our ability to make a positive contribution to our results of operation.\nWe depend on our key personnel and the loss of their services would adversely affect our operations and business strategy.\nIf we are unable to maintain our key personnel and attract new employees with high levels of expertise in the gaming areas in which we engage and propose to engage, or are unable to do so without unreasonably increasing our labor costs, the execution of our business strategy may be hindered and our growth limited. We believe that our success is largely dependent on the continued employment of our executive management and the hiring of strategic key personnel at reasonable costs. Competition for qualified executives is intense and we can give no assurance that we would be able to hire a qualified replacement with the required level of experience and expertise for any current members of our senior management, if required to do so. Accordingly, if any of our current key executives were unable or unwilling to continue in his or her present position, or we were unable to attract a sufficient number of qualified employees at reasonable rates, our business, results of operations and financial condition will be materially adversely affected. Additionally, recruiting and hiring a replacement for any executive management position could divert the attention of other senior management and increase our operating expenses.\nCurrently, full-scale casino gaming, other than Native American gaming, is not yet operational in New York.\nWe are not permitted to operate a full-scale casino at Monticello Casino and Raceway. In order to operate a full-scale casino at Montreign Resort Casino, and prior to our construction of the Casino Project, Montreign will have to be awarded a Gaming Facility License by the NYSGC. Licenses are expected to be awarded in 2015. Although we were selected by the Siting Board to apply for such license, there can be no assurance that we would be able to secure any necessary licenses, regulatory approvals or financing arrangements necessary to develop the Casino Project. In the event that we are unable to obtain a Gaming Facility License or to timely develop and successfully operate Montreign Resort Casino to compete with any full-scale casinos or Class III casinos that may be developed by our competitors, our business and future operating performance would likely be materially adversely effected.\nOn March 7, 2012, Concord filed a complaint against EPR and us seeking monetary damages and permanent injunctive relief against EPR and us relating to our joint development of the EPT Property. This litigation may delay or alter our plans for the development of the Adelaar Project.\nOn September 18, 2013, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (\u201cSDNY\u201d) granted Motions to Dismiss filed by us and all other defendants. This lawsuit was filed in March 2012 by Concord and various affiliates in the SDNY and asserted in an amended complaint various federal antitrust claims against us, EPR, EPT, Genting NY LLC and Kien Huat. The lawsuit arises out of our exclusivity agreement and option agreement with EPT to develop the site of the EPT Property located in Sullivan County, New York. Concord brought federal antitrust claims alleging conspiracy in restraint of trade, conspiracy to monopolize and monopolization. Concord also brought state law claims for tortious interference with contract and business relations. Concord sought damages in an amount to be determined at trial but not less than subject to automatic trebling under federal antitrust laws), unspecified punitive damages and permanent injunctive relief. In its decision, the SDNY dismissed Concord\u2019s federal antitrust claims with prejudice and dismissed Concord's state law claims without\nprejudice. On October 2, 2013, Concord filed a Motion for Reconsideration and on October 18, 2013, Concord filed a Notice of Appeal. On October 22, 2013, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (\"2nd Circuit Court\") issued a Notice of Stay of Appeal pending the outcome of the Motion for Reconsideration. On November 3, 2014, SDNY denied Concord's Motion for Reconsideration. The 2nd Circuit Court lifted the Stay of Appeal and the Appeal has been fully briefed. The 2nd Circuit Court has scheduled oral argument for April 29, 2015. Although we believe this lawsuit is without merit and we will aggressively defend our interests, it may delay or alter our plans with respect to the Casino Project or Project.\nRisk Relating to our Ownership Structure\nStockholders\u2019 ability to influence corporate decisions may be limited because our major stockholder owns a large percentage of our common stock.\nKien Huat Realty III Limited (\u201cKien Huat\u201d) is the beneficial holder of 31,191,035 shares of our common stock, representing approximately 67.0% of our voting power as of February 6, 2015. Affiliates of our largest stockholder hold ownership interests in other gaming companies, one of which is a VGM facility in New York City, New York. Under the terms of an investment agreement with Kien Huat (the \u201cInvestment Agreement\u201d), if any option or warrant outstanding as of November 12, 2009, the date of the final closing of the Investment Agreement, (or, in limited circumstances, if issued after such date) is exercised, Kien Huat has the right (following notice of such exercise) to purchase an equal number of additional shares of our common stock as are issued upon such exercise at the exercise price for the applicable option or warrant. On November 17, 2010, Empire entered into a loan agreement (the \"Loan Agreement\") with Kien Huat pursuant to which Kien Huat made a loan (the \"Kien Huat Loan\") represented by a convertible promissory note (the \"Kien Huat Note\") in the principal amount of $35 million and which had an interest rate of 5%. The Company paid down the principle of the Kien Huat Note in the amount of approximately $17.6 million from the proceeds of the rights offering the Company consummated in May 2011. As long as Kien Huat continues to own more than a majority of our outstanding common stock, the percentage of our outstanding shares of common stock and voting power owned by Kien Huat would not increase as a result of the purchase by Kien Huat of any shares of our common stock pursuant to such matching right, given the issuance of shares upon exercise of the option or warrant that triggered the matching right. However, the percentage of outstanding shares of common stock and voting power owned by Kien Huat would increase upon the conversion of the outstanding Kien Huat Note into shares of Common Stock. Under the terms of the Investment Agreement, Kien Huat is also entitled to recommend three directors whom we are required to cause to be elected or appointed to our Board of Directors (\u201cBoard\u201d), subject to the satisfaction of all legal and governance requirements regarding service as a director and to the reasonable approval of the Corporate Governance and Nominations Committee of our Board. Kien Huat will continue to be entitled to recommend three directors for so long as it owns at least 24% of our voting power outstanding at such time, after which the number of directors whom Kien Huat will be entitled to designate for election to our Board will be reduced proportionally to Kien Huat\u2019s percentage of ownership. Under the Investment Agreement, for so long as Kien Huat is entitled to recommend nominees to serve as board members, among other things, Kien Huat will have the right to nominate one of its director designees to serve as the Chairman of the Board. Mr. Pearlman has been appointed to serve as Chairman of the Board pursuant to Kien Huat\u2019s recommendation. Until such time as Kien Huat ceases to own capital stock with at least 30% of our voting power outstanding at such time, our Board will be prohibited under the terms of the Investment Agreement from taking certain actions relating to fundamental transactions involving us and our subsidiaries and certain other matters without the affirmative vote of the directors recommended by Kien Huat and elected by shareholders. Consequently, Kien Huat has the ability to exert significant influence over our policies and affairs, including the election of our Board and the approval of any action requiring a stockholder vote, such as approving amendments to our certificate of incorporation and mergers or sales of substantially all of our assets, as well as other matters. This concentration of voting power could delay or prevent an acquisition of our Company on terms that other stockholders may desire or force the sale of our company on terms undesirable to other stockholders.\nRisks Relating to the Market Value of Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock is volatile, leading to the possibility of its value being depressed at a time when our stockholders want to sell their holdings.\nThe market price of our common stock has in the past been, and may in the future continue to be, volatile. For instance, between January 1, 2014 and March 6, 2015, the closing price of our common stock has ranged between $9.08 and $4.05 per share. A variety of events may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly, including but not necessarily limited to:\n\u2022\nquarter to quarter variations in operating results;\n\u2022\nday traders;\n\u2022\nadverse or positive news reports or public announcements; and\n\u2022\nmarket conditions for the gaming industry.\nIn addition, the stock market in recent years has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a substantial effect on the market prices of companies, at times for reasons unrelated to their operating performance. These market fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our common stock and other interests in the Company at a time when our stockholders want to sell their interest in us.\nIf we fail to meet the applicable continued listing requirements of NASDAQ Global Market, NASDAQ may delist our common stock, in which case the liquidity and market price of our common stock could decline.\nOur common stock is currently listed on the NASDAQ Global Market. In order to maintain that listing, we must satisfy certain continued listing requirements. If we are deficient in maintaining the necessary listing requirements, our common stock may be delisted. If our stock is delisted, an active trading market for our common stock may not be sustained and the market price of our common stock could decline.\nWe do not anticipate declaring any dividends in the foreseeable future.\nDuring the past three fiscal years, we did not declare or pay any cash dividends with respect to our common stock and we do not anticipate declaring any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We intend to retain all future earnings for use in the development of our business. In addition, the payment of cash dividends to the holders of our common stock is restricted by undeclared dividends on our Series E preferred stock. We have accumulated unpaid Series E preferred dividends of approximately $256,000 as of December 31, 2014. There can be no assurance that we will have, at any time, sufficient surplus under Delaware law to be able to pay any dividends.\nFuture sales of our common stock by our insiders may cause our stock price to decline.\nA portion of our outstanding shares are held by directors and executive officers. Resales of a substantial number of shares of our stock by these stockholders, announcements of the proposed resale of substantial amounts of our stock, or the perception that substantial resales may be made by such stockholders could adversely impact the market price of our stock. Some of our directors and executive officers have entered into Rule 10b5-1 trading plans pursuant to which they have arranged to sell shares of our common stock from time to time in the future. Actual or potential sales by these insiders, including those under a pre-arranged Rule 10b5-1 trading plan may adversely impact the market price of our stock.\nFuture sales of shares of our common stock in the public market or the conversion of the Kien Huat Loan could adversely affect the trading price of shares of our common stock and our ability to raise funds in new stock offerings.\nFuture sales of substantial amounts of shares of our common stock in the public market, including pursuant to the January 2015 Rights Offering, the effective shelf registration statement, the conversion of the Kien Huat Loan, which is described below, into shares of our common stock, or the perception that such sales or conversion are likely to occur could affect the market price of our common stock. Kien Huat\u2019s stock ownership may also discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us, which in turn could reduce our stock price or prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium over our stock price.\nGeneral Business Risks\nInstability and volatility in the financial markets could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe demand for entertainment and leisure activities tends to be highly sensitive to consumers\u2019 disposable incomes, and the recent decline in consumer confidence had a negative impact on overall trends in the gaming industry in 2012, 2013 and, to an extent, in 2014. Discretionary consumer spending habits have been adversely affected by the recent economic conditions and the actual or perceived economic conditions could lead to further decrease in spending by our guests. We cannot predict at what level these negative trends will continue, worsen or improve and the ultimate impact it will have on our future results of operations. The continued weakness in our market and the deterioration of the broader global economy would have a material adverse effect on our industry and our business, including our revenues, profitability, operating results and cash flow.\nMoreover, we will need to raise additional capital or incur additional indebtedness to finance our plans for growth or make scheduled payments on or to refinance our obligations under the Kien Huat Loan. Recent turmoil in the credit markets and the resulting impact on the liquidity of certain large financial institutions has had, and may continue to have, an effect through the U.S. economy, including limiting access to credit markets for certain borrowers at reasonable rates. Due to fluctuations in the credit markets from time to time, we may be unable to incur additional indebtedness to fund our business strategy, in the public or private markets, on terms we believe to be reasonable, if at all. Such instability and volatility in the\nfinancial markets may adversely impact our ability to obtain the financing necessary to pursue the development of the Casino Project.\nWe are subject to greater risks than a geographically diverse company.\nOur operations are limited to the Catskills region of the State of New York, which has been affected by decades-long decline in economic conditions. As a result, in addition to our susceptibility to adverse global and domestic economic, political and business conditions, any economic downturn in the region could have a material adverse effect on our operations. An economic downturn would likely cause a decline in the disposable income of consumers in the region, which could result in a decrease in the number of patrons at our facility, the frequency of their visits and the average amount that they would be willing to spend at our facility. We are subject to greater risks than more geographically diversified gaming or resort operations, including:\n\u2022\na downturn in national, regional or local economic conditions;\n\u2022\nan increase in competition in New York State or the northeastern United States and Canada, particularly for day-trip patrons residing in New York State, including as a result of any new tribal Class III casinos, destination gaming resorts or VGMs at certain racetracks and other locations in New York, Connecticut and casinos in Pennsylvania;\n\u2022\nimpeded access due to road construction or closures of primary access routes; and\n\u2022\nadverse weather and natural and other disasters in the northeastern United States.\nThe occurrence of any one of the events described above could cause a material disruption in our business and make us unable to generate sufficient cash flow to make payments on our obligations.\nOur business is particularly sensitive to energy prices and a rise in energy prices could harm our operating results.\nWe are a large consumer of electricity and other energy and, therefore, higher energy prices may have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Accordingly, increases in energy costs may have a negative impact on our operating results. Additionally, higher electricity and gasoline prices which affect our customers may result in reduced visitation to Monticello Casino and Raceway and a reduction in our revenues.\nOur business could be affected by weather-related factors and seasonality.\nOur results of operations may be adversely affected by weather-related and seasonal factors. Severe winter weather conditions may deter or prevent patrons from reaching our gaming facilities or undertaking day trips. In addition, some recreational activities are curtailed during the winter months. Although our budget assumes these seasonal fluctuations in our gaming revenues to ensure adequate cash flow during expected periods of lower revenues, we cannot ensure that weather-related and seasonal factors will not have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nWe are vulnerable to natural disasters and other disruptive events that could severely disrupt the normal operations of our business and adversely affect our earnings.\nOur operations are located at a facility in Monticello, New York. Although this area is not prone to earthquakes, floods, tornadoes, fires or other natural disasters, the occurrence of any of these events or any other cause of material disruption in our operation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Moreover, although we do maintain insurance customary for our industry, including a policy with $10 million limit of coverage for the perils of flood and earthquake, we cannot ensure that this coverage will be sufficient in the event of one of the disasters mentioned above.\nWe may be subject to material environmental liability as a result of unknown environmental hazards.\nWe currently own 232 acres of land. As a significant landholder, we are subject to numerous environmental laws. Specifically, under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or chemical releases on or relating to its property and may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage, personal injury and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred by such parties in connection with the contamination. Such laws typically impose cleanup responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner knew of or caused the presence of contaminants. The costs of investigation, remediation or removal of such substances may be substantial.\nPotential changes in the regulatory environment could harm our business.\nFrom time to time, legislators and special interest groups have proposed legislation that would expand, restrict or prevent gaming operations in the jurisdictions in which we operate or intend to operate. In addition, from time to time, certain anti-gaming groups propose referenda that, if adopted, could force us to curtail operations and incur significant losses.\nOur information technology and other systems are subject to cyber security risk including misappropriation of customer information or other breaches of information security.\nWe rely on information technology and other systems to maintain and transmit customers' personal and/or financial information, credit card information, mailing lists and other information. We have taken steps designed to safeguard our customers' personal and financial information and have implemented systems designed to meet all requirements of the Payment Card Industry standards for data protection. However, our information and processes are subject to the ever-changing threat of compromised security, in the form of a risk of potential breach, system failure, computer virus or unauthorized or fraudulent access or use by unauthorized individuals. The steps we take to deter and mitigate these risks may not be successful, and any resulting compromise or loss of data or systems could adversely impact operations or regulatory compliance and could result in remedial expenses, fines, litigation and loss of reputation, potentially impacting our financial results. Although we have invested in and deployed security systems and developed processes that are designed to protect all sensitive data, prevent data loss and reduce the impact of any security breach, such measures cannot provide absolute security.", "PERMNO": 79790, "SIC": 7990, "TIC": "NYNY"}
