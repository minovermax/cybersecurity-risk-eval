{"cik": "811641", "company": "IMMUCELL CORP /DE/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-30", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nFinancial Risks\nGross margin on product sales: One of our goals is to achieve a gross margin (before related depreciation expenses) as a percentage of total sales close to 50% after the initial launch of new products. Depreciation expense will be a larger component of costs of goods sold for Re-Tain\u2122 than it is for the First Defense\u00ae product line. Gross margins generally improve over time, but this anticipated improvement may not be realized. Many factors discussed in this report impact our costs of goods sold. There is a risk that we are not able to achieve our gross margin goals, which would adversely affect our operating results and could impact our future operating plans.\nExposure to interest rates and debt service obligations: Rising interest rates could negatively affect the operating costs of dairy and beef producers and thus put further financial pressure on an already stressed business sector, which could indirectly affect our business. We removed the direct aspect of this particular exposure to our business by refinancing our bank debt to fixed rate notes at 3.5% per annum during the first quarter of 2020. The additional debt we incurred to fund the development of Re-Tain\u2122 has significantly increased our debt service costs. We are obligated to make principal and interest payments aggregating approximately $1.1 million, $1.1 million and $1.2 million during the years ending December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively. See Note 10 to the accompanying audited financial statements for more information.\nDebt covenants: Our bank debt is subject to certain financial covenants. Prior to the bank debt refinancing that we completed during the fourth quarter of 2020, our bank held $1.4 million in escrow (non-current asset). By using $624,000 of the proceeds from our bank debt refinancing during the fourth quarter of 2020 to prepay a portion of our mortgage loan, we reduced the then outstanding balance of the mortgage loan to 80% of the most recent appraisal value, which allowed the bank to release these funds from escrow. We are required to meet a minimum debt service coverage ratio set by the bank of 1.35. This debt service coverage ratio was 2.03 and 1.57 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Based on our projected financial performance, we may not satisfy this annual requirement for the year ending December 31, 2021. There is a risk that we may not be able to reach an agreement with our bank to waive this covenant requirement during the first quarter of 2022.\nProjection of net income (loss): Generally speaking, our financial performance can differ significantly from management projections, due to numerous factors that are difficult to predict or that are beyond our control. Weaker than expected sales of the First Defense\u00ae product line could lead to less profits or deeper operating losses. The timing of FDA approval of Re-Tain\u2122 and the initiation of commercial sales of that product will have a material impact on our net (loss) income during 2021 and 2022. Additionally, this complexity and uncertainty is magnified by the risks relating to and arising out of the duration, extent and nature of adverse effects from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nRisks associated with our funding strategy for Re-Tain\u2122: Failure to maintain adequate cash and liquidity to support the commercialization of Re-Tain\u2122 is a risk to our business. Achieving FDA approval of our pharmaceutical-grade Nisin produced at commercial-scale is the most critical action remaining in front of us on our path to U.S. regulatory approval of Re-Tain\u2122. Having completed the construction and equipping of the Drug Substance production facility described elsewhere in this report at a cost of approximately $20.8 million, we will continue to incur product development expenses to operate and maintain this facility. Absent sufficient sales of Re-Tain\u2122 at a profitable gross margin, we would be required to fund all debt service costs from sales of the First Defense\u00ae product line, which would reduce, and could eliminate, our expected profitability going forward and significantly reduce our cash flows.\nUncertainty of market size and product sales estimates: Estimating the size of the total addressable market and future sales growth potential for our First Defense\u00ae product line is based on our experience and understanding of market dynamics but is inherently subjective. Estimating the size of the market for any new product, such as Re-Tain\u2122, involves more uncertainties than do projections for established products. We do not know whether, or to what extent, our products will achieve, maintain or increase market acceptance and profitability. Some of the uncertainties surrounding Re-Tain\u2122 include the product\u2019s effectiveness against prevalent pathogens, market acceptance, the effect of a premium selling price on market penetration, cost of manufacture and competition from new and existing products sold by substantially larger competitors with greater market reach and promotional resources. Since Re-Tain\u2122 is a novel approach to treating mastitis, there are many uncertainties with regards to how quickly and to what extent we can develop the subclinical mastitis treatment market. Producers\u2019 current practice generally is to treat only clinical mastitis, which has the visual indicator of abnormal milk. We will need to change that practice and increase awareness of the importance of treating subclinical disease. This will require the producers\u2019 ability and willingness to diagnose without visual indicators. There is a risk that dairy producers and processors will not accept this new technology because of the risk that it may negatively effect cheese making if present in a high enough concentration in any cheese batch that utilizes a starter culture that is susceptible to Nisin. Reducing this risk somewhat is our belief that bacteriocin technology (over traditional antibiotics) is expected to be viewed positively.\nImmuCell Corporation\nNet deferred tax assets: The realizability of our net deferred tax assets is a subjective estimate that is contingent upon many variables. During the second quarter of 2018, we recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets that significantly increased our net loss in comparison to other periods. This non-cash expense could be reversed, and this valuation allowance could be reduced or eliminated, if warranted by our future profitability and projected profitability in the future. We will continue to assess the need for the valuation allowance at each quarter.\nProduct Risks\nProduct risks generally: The sale of our products is subject to production, financial, efficacy, regulatory, competitive and other market risks. Elevated standards to achieve and maintain regulatory compliance required to sell our products continue to evolve. Failure to achieve acceptable biological yields from our production processes can materially increase our costs of goods sold and reduce our production output, leading to an order backlog that could adversely affect our customer relationships and operating results. There is no assurance that we will continue to achieve market acceptance of the First Defense\u00ae product line at a profitable price level or that we can continue to manufacture our products at a low enough cost to result in a sufficient gross margin to justify their continued manufacture and sale. Similar concerns exist with Re-Tain\u2122 as we bring that product to market, which could be heightened by the additional uncertainties associated with introducing a new product requiring a shift in customer behavior.\nReliance on sales of the First Defense\u00ae product line: We are reliant on the market acceptance of the First Defense\u00ae product line to generate product sales and fund our operations. Our business would not have been profitable during the nine consecutive years in the period ended December 31, 2007, during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013, 2015 and 2016, during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2017 or during the three-month period ended March 31, 2019, without the gross margin that we earned on sales of the First Defense\u00ae product line.\nConcentration of sales: Sales of the First Defense\u00ae product line aggregated 98% and 97% of our total product sales during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our primary customers for the majority of our product sales (89% during both of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019) are in the U.S. dairy and beef industries. Product sales to international customers, who are also in the dairy and beef industries, aggregated 11% and 10% of our total product sales during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The concentration of our sales from one product into one market is a risk to our business. The animal health distribution segment has been aggressively consolidating over the last few years with larger distributors acquiring smaller distributors. A large portion of our product sales (71% and 69% during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively) was made to two large distributors. A large portion of our trade accounts receivable (75% and 76% as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively) was due from these two distributors. We have a good history with these distributors, but the concentration of sales and accounts receivable with a small number of customers does present a risk to us, including risks related to such customers experiencing financial difficulties or altering the basis on which they do business with us in a manner unfavorable to us.\nProduction capacity constraints: During the second quarter of 2021, we expect to complete an investment of approximately $3.5 million to increase our production capacity (in terms of annual sales dollars) for the First Defense\u00ae product line from approximately $16.5 million to approximately $23 million based on current selling prices and estimated production yields. While this capacity expansion investment is currently proceeding on budget, there is a risk of cost overruns in any future production expansions that we may undertake, and a risk that we will not be able to achieve our production capacity growth objectives on a timely basis, resulting in a continuing or increasing short fall in supply to the market. The inability to meet market demand for our products is a risk to our business. The large backlog of orders aggregating approximately $1.8 million as of December 31, 2020, as well as any ongoing order backlog, presents a risk that we could lose customers during this period that are not easily regained thereafter, when our production capacity is expected to meet or exceed sales demand. Our plan to continue to expand the First Defense\u00ae product line requires ongoing review of equipment capacity and utilization across the manufacturing value stream at the 56 Evergreen Drive facility and our leased facility at 175 Industrial Way, as well as assessment of functional obsolescence and reliability of equipment. This review and assessment could identify a need to fund unexpected equipment maintenance or replacement costs.\nImmuCell Corporation\nProduct liability: The manufacture and sale of our products entails a risk of product liability. Our exposure to product liability is mitigated to some extent by the fact that our products are directed towards the animal health market. We have maintained product liability insurance in an amount which we believe is reasonable in relation to our potential exposure in this area. We have no history of claims of this nature being made.\nRegulatory Risks\nRegulatory requirements for the First Defense\u00ae product line: First Defense\u00ae is sold in the United States subject to a product license from the Center for Veterinary Biologics, USDA, which was first obtained in 1991, with subsequent approvals of line extensions in 2017 and 2018. As a result, our operations are subject to periodic inspection by the USDA. The potency of serial lots is directly traceable to the original serial used to obtain the product performance claims (the Reference Standard). Due to the unique nature of the label claims, host animal re-testing is not required as long as periodic laboratory analyses continue to support the stability of stored Reference Standard. To date, these analyses have demonstrated strong stability. However, if the USDA were not to approve requalification of the Reference Standard, additional clinical studies could be required to meet regulatory requirements and allow for continued sales of the product, which could interrupt sales and adversely affect our operating results. Territories outside of the United States may require additional regulatory oversight that we may not be able to meet with our current facilities, processes and resources.\nRegulatory requirements for Re-Tain\u2122: The commercial introduction of this product in the United States requires us to obtain FDA approval. We have disclosed a timeline of events that could lead to potential product approval during the period from the fourth quarter of 2021 to the second quarter of 2022. Completing the development through to approval of the NADA by the FDA involves risk. While four of the five required Technical Sections have been approved, the development process timeline has been extensive (approximately 20 years) and has involved multiple commercial production strategies. The first-phased Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls Technical Section was submitted for the Nisin Drug Substance during the first quarter of 2019, and the FDA response was received during the third quarter of 2019. We filed the second-phased Drug Substance and Drug Product submission during the first quarter of 2021. To reduce the risk associated with this process, we are working with Norbrook Laboratories Ltd for alignment of the required validations and Drug Product manufacture and continue to meet with the FDA to align on filing strategy and requirements. Our efforts are subject to inspection and approval by the FDA. There remains a risk that the required FDA approvals of our product and facilities could be delayed or not obtained. International regulatory approvals would be required for sales of Re-Tain\u2122 outside of the United States.\nEconomic Risks Pertaining to the Dairy and Beef Industries\nThe industry data referred to below is compiled from USDA databases.\nCattle count: The January count of all cattle and calves in the United States had steadily declined from 97,000,000 as of January 1, 2007 to 88,500,000 as of January 1, 2014. Then this figure increased each year to reach 94,800,000 as of January 1, 2019 before declining to 93,800,000 as of January 1, 2020 and decreasing a little further to 93,600,000 as of January 1, 2021. Reflecting seasonal trends, this figure was equal to 103,000,000 and 102,900,000 as of July 1, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nHerd size: Prior to 1957, there were over 20,000,000 cows in the U.S. dairy herd. Prior to 1986, there were over 10,000,000 cows in the U.S. dairy herd. From 1998 through 2020, the size (annual average) of the U.S. dairy herd ranged from approximately the low of 9,011,000 in 2004 to the high of 9,399,000 in 2018. This annual average dropped to 9,336,000 during 2019 and then increased to 9,388,000 during the year ended December 31, 2020. For the month of January 2021, this figure increased significantly to 9,450,000.\nImmuCell Corporation\nMilk price and feed costs: The dairy market, similar to many others, has been unstable as a result of the pandemic. The price paid to producers for milk has been very volatile. Milk was dumped on farms earlier in the year largely because of the loss of demand for dairy products from closed restaurants and school lunch programs and other negative impacts of the pandemic, but conditions have improved since then. The Class III milk price (an industry benchmark that reflects the value of product used to make cheese) is an important indicator because it defines our customers\u2019 revenue level. This annual average milk price level (measured in dollars per hundred pounds of milk) reached its highest point (since these prices were first reported in 1980) during 2014 at $22.34 (peaking at $24.60 in September 2014), which price level has never been repeated. During 2019, this milk price average increased by 16% over 2018 to $16.96. The low price level during 2018 and into the beginning of 2019 was very challenging to the profitability of our customers. During the year ended December 31, 2020, this average milk price was equal to $18.16, but it was extremely volatile during the year due largely to disruption in demand related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The one-month fluctuation of 73% from a low of $12.14 in May to $21.04 in June set an all-time record for variability. This milk price increased significantly to $24.54 for July 2020, which is very close to the all-time record high of $24.60 set in September 2014. Projections about the milk price in 2021 are uncertain. The annual fluctuations in this milk price level are demonstrated in the following table:\nThe actual level of milk prices may be less important than its level relative to feed costs. One measure of this relationship is known as the milk-to-feed price ratio, which represents the amount of feed that one pound of milk can buy. This ratio varies farm-to-farm based on individual operating parameters. The highest annual average this ratio has reached since this ratio was first reported in 1985 was 3.64 in 1987. The annual average for this ratio of 1.52 in 2012 was the lowest recorded since it was first reported in 1985. Since this ratio reached 3.24 in 2005, it has not exceeded 3.00. The annual average of 2.54 for 2014 was the highest this ratio has been since it was 2.81 in 2007. This ratio averaged 2.05 during 2018 and increased to 2.25 during 2019. This ratio increased to 2.31 during the year ended December 31, 2020. An increase in feed costs also has a negative impact on the beef industry. The following table demonstrates the annual volatility and the low values of this ratio recently:\nMilk cow price: The all-time high value (annual average) for a milk cow was $1,993 during 2015. Since then, this annual average value steadily declined to $1,205 during 2019 before increasing to $1,300 during 2020.\nImmuCell Corporation\nMarket volatility: While the number of cows in the U.S. herd and the production of milk per cow directly influence the supply of milk, the price for milk is also influenced by very volatile international demand for milk products. Given our focus on the dairy and beef industries, the volatile market conditions and the resulting financial insecurities of our primary end users are risks to our ability to maintain and grow sales at a profitable level. These factors also heighten the challenge of selling premium-priced animal health products (such as Tri-Shield First Defense\u00ae and Re-Tain\u2122) into the dairy market.\nSmall Size of Company\nDependence on key personnel: We are a small company with 61 employees (including 5 part-time employees). As such, we rely on certain key employees to support multiple operational functions, with limited redundancy in capacity. The loss of any of these key employees could adversely affect our operations until a qualified replacement is hired and trained. Our competitive position will be highly influenced by our ability to attract, retain and motivate key scientific, manufacturing, managerial and sales and marketing personnel.\nReliance on outside party to provide certain services under contract for us: We are exposed to additional regulatory compliance risks through the subcontractors that we choose to work with to produce Re-Tain\u2122, who also need to satisfy certain regulatory requirements in order to provide us with the products and services we need. We are investing approximately $4 million of the additional capital we raised during the first quarter of 2019 to construct and equip our own Drug Product formulation and aseptic filling capability for Re-Tain\u2122 inside our existing Drug Substance facility. The objective of this investment is to end our reliance on an outside party to perform these services for us. Actual project costs could exceed our current estimates, and we could fail to access adequate funding to complete this investment if costs were to increase. Completion of this project could be delayed due to a number of factors outside our control, including delays in equipment fabrication, equipment delivery or facility construction. In addition, there is a risk that we fail to achieve regulatory approval of the new facility. We face the risk of potential supply interruption if we do not effectively manage the end of supply provided from Norbrook for orders placed by December 31, 2021 for delivery into the first half of 2022 to align with the new supply from our own formulation and aseptic filling facility which we currently expect to be operational during the fourth quarter of 2022 or second quarter of 2023.\nCompetition from others: Many of our competitors are significantly larger and more diversified in the relevant markets than we are and have substantially greater financial, marketing, manufacturing and human resources and more extensive product development and sales/distribution capabilities than we do, including greater ability to withstand adverse economic or market conditions and declining revenues and/or profitability. Merck and Zoetis, among other companies, sell products that compete directly with the First Defense\u00ae product line in preventing scours in newborn calves. The scours product sold by Zoetis sells for approximately half the price of our product, although it does not have an E. coli claim (which ours does). With Tri-Shield First Defense\u00ae, we can now compete more effectively against vaccines that are given to the mother cow (dam) to improve the quality of the colostrum that she produces for the newborn calf. Elanco, Merck and Zoetis provide these dam vaccine products to the market. There are many companies competing in the mastitis treatment market, most notably Boehringer Ingelheim, Merck and Zoetis. The subclinical mastitis products sold by these large companies are well established in the market and are priced lower than what we expect for our product, but all of them involve traditional antibiotics and are sold subject to a requirement to discard milk during and for a period of time after treatment (unlike our product that carries zero milk discard and zero milk withhold claims). There is no assurance that our products will compete successfully in these markets. We may not be aware of other companies that compete with us or intend to compete with us in the future.\nImmuCell Corporation\nGlobal Risks\nGlobal COVID-19 pandemic (novel coronavirus, technically known as SARS-CoV-2): The global COVID-19 pandemic has created, and continues to create, a great deal of uncertainty for us. The positive indications about the improving health of the U.S. economy since 2008 and prior to the COVID-19 pandemic have proven to be temporary. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected international trade and created a worldwide health and economic crisis. The full impact of this viral outbreak on the global economy, and the duration of such impact, is very uncertain at this time. Stock market valuations have declined and recovered and remain volatile. There is a risk of a period of economic downturn, the severity and duration of which are difficult to know. Prior to the pandemic and the responsive federal economic stimulus programs, many feared the United States had taken on too much national debt. Now the debt load is significantly higher. The dairy market, similar to many others, has been unstable as a result of the pandemic. The price paid to producers for milk has been very volatile. Milk was dumped on farms earlier in the year largely because of the loss of demand for dairy products from closed restaurants and school lunch programs and other negative impacts of the pandemic, but conditions have improved since then. There is also economic uncertainty for beef producers, as the supply chain is interrupted or otherwise adversely affected due to closures of processing plants and reduced throughput caused by, among other things, restaurants closing or curtailing their operations. This is a very unusual situation for farmers that work so hard to improve production quality and efficiency in order to help feed a growing population with high-quality and cost-effective proteins. A combination of the conditions, trends and concerns summarized above could have a corresponding negative effect on our business and operations, including the supply of the colostrum we purchase to produce our First Defense\u00ae product line, the demand for our products in the U.S. market and our ability to penetrate or maintain a profitable presence in international markets. We could experience shortages in key components and needed products, backlogs and production slowdowns due to difficulties accessing needed supplies and labor and other restrictions affecting our ability to consistently deliver our products to market. Our exposure to this risk is mitigated to some extent by the fact that our supply chain is not heavily dependent on foreign manufacturers, by our on-going cross-training of our employees, by our implementation of remote work practices (where feasible) and by our early and continued compliance with recommended hygiene and social distancing practices. Despite our best efforts and intentions, there is a risk that an employee could become infected and could infect others. This could lead to plant shutdowns and production interruptions and have other negative economic and health and safety impacts.\nBovine diseases: The potential for epidemics of bovine diseases such as Foot and Mouth Disease, Bovine Tuberculosis, Brucellosis and Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) presents a risk to us and our customers. Documented cases of BSE in the United States have led to an overall tightening of regulations pertaining to ingredients of animal origin, especially bovine. The First Defense\u00ae product line is manufactured from bovine milk (colostrum), which is not considered a BSE risk material. Future regulatory action to increase protection of the human food supply could affect the First Defense\u00ae product line, although presently we do not anticipate that this will be the case.\nRisks Pertaining to Common Stock\nStock market valuation and liquidity: Our common stock trades on The Nasdaq Stock Market (Nasdaq: ICCC). Our average daily trading volume is lower than the volume for most other companies and the bid/ask stock price spread can be larger and prices can be volatile, which could result in investors facing difficulty selling their stock for proceeds that they may expect or desire. Our share price and average trading volume have seen a significant increase during the first quarter of 2021, but still most companies in the animal health sector have market capitalization values that greatly exceed our current market capitalization of approximately $80.6 million as of March 19, 2021. Our product sales during the year ended December 31, 2020 were $15.3 million. This means that our market valuation as of March 19, 2021 was equal to approximately 5.25 times our sales during the year ended December 31, 2020. Before gross margin from the sale of new products is achieved, our market capitalization may be heavily dependent on the perceived potential for growth from our product under development and may therefore be negatively affected by the related uncertainties and risks.\nCertain provisions might discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our Company or changes in our management: Provisions of our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws, our Common Stock Rights Plan or Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares of our common stock. These provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management. These provisions include:\n\u25cf limitations on the removal of directors;\n\u25cf advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations;\n\u25cf the ability of our Board of Directors to alter or repeal our bylaws;\nImmuCell Corporation\n\u25cf the ability of our Board of Directors to refuse to redeem rights issued under our Common Stock Rights Plan or otherwise to limit or suspend its operation that would work to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, potentially preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our Board of Directors; and\n\u25cf Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits a publicly-held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder (generally defined as a person which together with its affiliates owns, or within the last three years has owned, 15% of our voting stock, for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder) unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nThe existence of the foregoing provisions and anti-takeover measures could depress the trading price of our common stock or limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. They could also deter potential acquirers of our Company, thereby reducing the likelihood of obtaining a premium for our common stock in an acquisition.\nNo expectation to pay any dividends or repurchase stock for the foreseeable future: We do not anticipate paying any dividends to, or repurchasing stock from, our stockholders for the foreseeable future. Instead, we expect to use cash to fund product development costs and investments in our facilities and production equipment, and to increase our working capital and to reduce debt. Stockholders must be prepared to rely on market sales of their common stock after price appreciation to earn an investment return, which may never occur. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable laws, current and anticipated needs for liquidity and other factors our Board of Directors deems relevant.\nPossible dilution: We may need to access the capital markets again and issue additional common stock in order to fund our growth objectives, as described elsewhere in this report. Such issuances could have a dilutive effect on our existing stockholders.\nOther Risks\nAccess to raw materials and contract manufacturing services: Our objective is to maintain more than one source of supply for the components used to manufacture and test our products that we obtain from third parties. However, there is a risk that we could have difficulty in efficiently acquiring essential supplies. We have significantly increased the number of farms from which we purchase colostrum for the First Defense\u00ae product line. A significant reduction in farm capacity could make it difficult for us to produce enough inventory to meet customer demand. The specific antibodies that we purify from colostrum for the First Defense\u00ae product line are not readily available from other sources. We are and will be dependent on our manufacturing facilities and operations in Portland for the production of the First Defense\u00ae product line and Re-Tain\u2122. We are and will be dependent on one manufacturer for the supply of the syringes used for our gel tube formats of Dual-Force First Defense\u00ae and Tri-Shield First Defense\u00ae and one other manufacturer for the supply of syringes for Re-Tain\u2122. We expect to be dependent on a contract with Norbrook for the Drug Product formulation and aseptic filling of our Nisin Drug Substance for orders placed through December 31, 2021 with deliveries extending into the first half of 2022. We expect to complete the investment to perform these services in-house during 2022 and achieve the required regulatory approval for use by the fourth quarter of 2022 or second quarter of 2023. The facility we intend to construct to perform these services in-house will be subject to FDA inspection and approval, the outcome and timing of which are not within our control. The potential alternative options for these services are narrowed considerably because our product cannot be formulated or filled in a facility that also processes traditional antibiotics (i.e., beta lactams). Any significant damage to or other disruption in the services at any of these third-party facilities or our own facilities (including due to regulatory non-approval or non-compliance) would adversely affect the production of inventory and result in significant added expenses and potential loss of future sales.\nFailure to protect intellectual property: In some cases, we have chosen (and may choose in the future) not to seek patent protection for certain products or processes. Instead, we have sought (and may seek in the future) to maintain the confidentiality of any relevant proprietary technology through trade secrets, operational safeguards and contractual agreements. Reliance upon trade secret, rather than patent, protection may cause us to be vulnerable to competitors who successfully replicate (knock off) our manufacturing techniques and processes. Additionally, there can be no assurance that others may not independently develop similar trade secrets or technology or obtain access to our unpatented trade secrets or proprietary technology. Other companies may have filed patent applications and may have been issued patents involving products or technologies potentially useful to us or necessary for us to commercialize our products or achieve our business goals. If that were to be the case, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain licenses to such patents on terms that are acceptable to us. There is also a risk that competitors could challenge the claims in patents that have been issued to us.\nImmuCell Corporation\nIncreasing dependence on the continuous and reliable operation of our information technology systems: We rely on information systems throughout our company. Any disruption of these systems or significant security breaches could adversely affect our business. Although we maintain information security policies and employ system backup measures and engage in information system redundancy planning and processes, such policies, measures, planning and processes, as well as our current disaster recovery plan may be ineffective or inadequate to address all eventualities. As information systems and the use of software and related applications by us, our business partners, suppliers, and customers become more cloud-based, we become inherently more susceptible to cyberattacks. There has been an increase in global cybersecurity vulnerabilities and threats, including more sophisticated and targeted cyber-related attacks that pose a risk to the security of our information systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of data and information. There are reports of increased activity by hackers and scammers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Any such attack or breach could compromise our networks and the information stored thereon could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost, or stolen. While we have invested in our data and information technology infrastructure (including working with an information security technology consultant to assess and enhance our security systems and procedures, and periodically training our employees in such systems and procedures), there can be no assurance that these efforts will prevent a system disruption, attack, or security breach and, as such, the risk of system disruptions and security breaches from a cyberattack remains. We have not experienced any material adverse effect on our business or operations as a consequence of any such attack or breach but may incur increasing costs in performing the tasks described above. Given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of such disruptions and the evolving nature of cybersecurity threats, which vary in technique and sources, if we or our business partners or suppliers were to experience a system disruption, attack or security breach that impacts any of our critical functions, or our customers were to experience a system disruption, attack or security breach via any of our connected products and services, we could potentially be subject to production downtimes, operational delays or other detrimental impacts on our operations. Furthermore, any access to, public disclosure of, or other loss of data or information (including any of our - or our customers\u2019 or suppliers\u2019 - confidential or proprietary information or personal data or information) as a result of an attack or security breach could result in governmental actions or private claims or proceedings, which could damage our reputation, cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, damage our ability to develop (and protect our rights to) our proprietary technologies and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. While this exposure is common to all companies, larger companies with greater resources may be better able to mitigate this risk than we can.", "PERMNO": 11292, "SIC": 2835, "TIC": "ICCC"}
