{"cik": "1681689", "company": "Bioverativ Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-24", "item_1A": "Item 1A Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this report in evaluating Bioverativ and Bioverativ's common stock. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition and could adversely impact, or result in volatility to, our stock price following the distribution. The risk factors generally have been separated into three groups: risks related to our business, risks related to the separation from Biogen and risks related to our common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe are dependent on revenues from our products, ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX. If we or Sobi are unable to successfully commercialize ELOCTATE or ALPROLIX, our results of operations would be materially harmed.\nNet sales of ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX represent substantially all of our revenues, and this concentration makes us dependent on these two products. Further, we currently have limited resources for commercializing ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX outside of the United States, Japan and Canada, and are dependent on the efforts of Sobi in its commercialization territory. If we were to experience difficulty with the commercialization of ELOCTATE or ALPROLIX, or if Sobi were to experience difficulty with the commercialization of ELOCTATE or ALPROLIX in its commercialization territory, we could experience a significant reduction in revenue and may not be profitable.\nWe expect that continued commercialization of ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX will depend on many factors, including the following:\n\u2022 the effectiveness of our commercial strategy in and outside of the United States for the marketing of ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX;\n\u2022 our ability to maintain our development and commercialization arrangements with Sobi (see Item 1. Business-Our Development and Commercialization Arrangements with Sobi);\n\u2022 the success of our strategies for maintaining and enhancing a positive reputation among hemophilia patients and those in the hemophilia treatment community as to the efficacy and safety of ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX; and\n\u2022 other factors described below in this \"Risk Factors\" section.\nMany of these factors are beyond our control, and success in any one of these factors will not guarantee success in any of the others. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to generate revenue through the sale of ELOCTATE or ALPROLIX.\nIf our hemophilia products fail to compete effectively, our business and market position would suffer.\nDue to our dependence on sales of our hemophilia products, our business may be harmed if our products are unable to successfully compete in the hemophilia treatment market. The hemophilia treatment market is highly competitive. We compete in the marketing and sale of our products, and in the development of, and acquisition of rights to, new products and technologies.\nWe compete with biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies that have greater financial, technological and other resources than we do. One or more of our competitors may benefit from significantly greater sales and marketing capabilities, may develop products that are accepted more widely than ours or may receive patent protection that dominates, blocks or adversely affects our product development or business.\nOur ability to successfully compete with other hemophilia treatments may be adversely affected if our therapies are not regarded by patients, healthcare providers or payors as offering significant benefits and value as compared to other current treatments. We are aware of a number of companies, including large biopharmaceutical companies, such as Bayer AG, Pfizer Inc., CSL Ltd., Roche Holding AG and Shire Plc., that currently market or are pursuing the development of products for the treatment of hemophilia. We are also aware of other extended half-life factor products as well as other new technologies, such as gene therapies and bi-specific antibodies, that are in development and, if successfully developed and approved, would compete with ELOCTATE or ALPROLIX. New therapies and technologies have the potential to transform the standard of care for hemophilia patients, and our products may be unable to compete successfully with such new therapies and technologies that may be developed and marketed by other companies.\nIn addition, our relatively recent entrance into the hemophilia treatment market relative to certain of our competitors may impact our ability to develop relationships with the associated medical and scientific community that are necessary to properly inform these communities regarding the relative benefits that our products offer.\nIssues with product quality or safety, including the perception of such issues, could negatively affect our business, subject us to regulatory or other actions and cause a loss of confidence in us or our products.\nOur success depends upon the quality and safety of our products. Even after a product is approved for marketing, new safety data may emerge from adverse event reports or post-marketing studies. Previously unknown risks and adverse effects of our products may also be discovered in connection with unapproved or off-label uses of our products. Additionally, FDA, at their discretion, may review and raise new or additional questions related to approved product information. This could result in changes to the approved product prescribing information or to the product approval itself. A quality or safety issue, including the perception of such issues, may result in investigations by regulatory authorities, product liability, adverse inspection reports, warning letters, product recalls or seizures, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution of products, civil or criminal sanctions, costly litigation, requirements for additional labeling or safety monitoring, refusal of a government to grant approvals and licenses, restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses. An inability to address any of these issues in an effective and timely manner may cause negative publicity, loss of physician and patient confidence in the company or its current or future products and may negatively impact physicians' decisions to prescribe our products. These issues could also result in liabilities, loss of revenue, material write-offs of inventory, withdrawal or voluntary recall of our products from the marketplace, delays or limitations in regulatory approvals, material impairments of intangible assets, goodwill and fixed assets, material restructuring charges, difficulty in successfully launching new products and other adverse impacts on our results of operations.\nOur reliance on third parties for our manufacturing and distribution processes increases the risk that we will not have available sufficient quantities of ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX, or that such quantities may not be available at an acceptable cost, which could delay, prevent or impair our commercialization efforts and materially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the commercial manufacture and distribution of ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX. For example, in connection with the separation and the distribution, we entered into a manufacturing and supply agreement with Biogen as our sole supplier of\nELOCTATE and ALPROLIX for a specified period of time. Biogen is currently the sole manufacturer of ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX. Biogen also relies on third parties with respect to certain aspects of its manufacturing process, including certain sole sources of raw materials. We also rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties to distribute our products, including global, regional, and specialty distribution and logistics providers and, for a transition period, Biogen.\nBiogen and other third party providers are independent entities subject to their own unique operational and financial risks that are outside of our control. Any of these third parties may not perform their obligations in a timely and cost-effective manner or in compliance with applicable regulations. Biogen, for instance, may be unable or unwilling to increase production capacity commensurate with demand for our products. Finding alternative providers could take a significant amount of time and involve significant expense due to the specialized nature of these services.\nIn the event we change manufacturing partners or the third parties providing packaging, labeling and/or storage of our products, we may need to obtain approval from applicable regulatory authorities. Manufacturers are generally required to maintain compliance with current cGMPs and other stringent requirements and are subject to inspections by the FDA and comparable agencies in other jurisdictions to confirm such compliance. These cGMP requirements and regulations are not prescriptive instructions on how to manufacture products, but rather a series of principles that must be observed during manufacturing; as a result, their implementation may not be clearly delineated and may present a challenging task as these regulatory requirements are complex, time-consuming and expensive. Moreover, as our products are biologics, they require processing steps that are more difficult than those required for most chemical pharmaceuticals. Any delay, interruption or other issues that arise in the manufacture, fill-finish, packaging or storage of our products as a result of a failure of our facilities or the facilities or operations of third parties to pass any regulatory agency inspection could result in administrative sanctions by the FDA or other U.S. or non-U.S. regulatory agencies. Significant noncompliance could also result in the imposition of monetary penalties or other civil or criminal sanctions.\nWe cannot be certain that we could reach agreement with alternative providers or that the FDA or other regulatory authorities would approve our use of alternative manufacturers or providers on a timely basis. Any adverse developments affecting our supply chain may result in development delays, shipment delays, inventory shortages, lot failures, product withdrawals or recalls or other interruptions in the commercial supply of our products. In addition, loss or damage to a manufacturing facility or storage site due to a natural disaster or otherwise could adversely affect our ability to manufacture sufficient quantities of our products or to deliver products to meet customer demand or contractual requirements, any of which may result in a loss of revenue and other adverse business consequences. We may also have to take inventory write-offs and incur other charges and expenses for products that fail to meet specifications, undertake costly remediation efforts or seek more costly manufacturing alternatives. Such developments could increase our manufacturing or development costs, cause us to lose revenue or market share as patients and physicians turn to competing therapeutics, diminish our profitability or damage our reputation. Moreover, any failure of Biogen to supply ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX could cause us to breach our supply agreements to Sobi for these products, which may subject us to liability under those agreements and impair our relationship with Sobi.\nOur inability to maintain adequate coverage, pricing or reimbursement for our products could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nSales of ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX are dependent, in large part, on the availability and extent of coverage, pricing and reimbursement from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. When a new biopharmaceutical product is approved, the availability of government and private insurance coverage for that product may be uncertain, as may be the pricing of the product and extent to which the product will be reimbursed. Failure to maintain\nadequate coverage, pricing or reimbursement for our products could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nPricing and reimbursement for our products may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u2022 changes in federal, state or foreign government regulations or private third party payors' reimbursement policies;\n\u2022 pressure by employers on private health insurance plans to reduce costs;\n\u2022 consolidation and increasing assertiveness of payors, including managed care organizations, health insurers, pharmacy benefit managers, government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations seeking price discounts or rebates in connection with the placement of our products on their formularies and, in some cases, imposing restrictions on access to, coverage of or pricing for particular drugs based on perceived value; and\n\u2022 the influence of third party organizations advocating for discounted pricing with respect to our products.\nOur ability to set the price for our products can vary significantly from country to country and, as a result, so can the price of our products. Pricing and acceptance of ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX in certain countries are also subject to risks due to the tendering process required in those countries, as well as the comparison of dose pricing of our products against conventional treatments. If we are unable to demonstrate to healthcare providers and payors the value of prophylaxis treatment and reduced consumption of our products compared to conventional treatments, our products may not be accepted or we may not secure adequate prices in a particular country. Our inability to secure adequate prices in a particular country may limit the marketing of our products within that country, and may also adversely affect our ability to obtain acceptable prices in other markets. This may create the opportunity for third party cross-border trade or influence our decision to sell or not to sell a product in a particular country, thus adversely affecting our geographic expansion plans and revenues.\nPricing for therapies and other health care costs are under significant scrutiny in the markets in which our products are prescribed and continue to be subject to intense political and societal pressures, which we anticipate will continue and escalate. As a result, our business and reputation may be harmed.\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain adequate protection for our intellectual property and other proprietary rights, or if we are unable to avoid violation of the intellectual property or proprietary rights of others, we may be subject to liability, the operation of our business may be interrupted or our business or prospects may be otherwise harmed.\nOur commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and defend patent and other intellectual property rights that are important to the development, manufacture and commercialization of our products and product candidates. The degree of patent protection that will be afforded to our products and processes in the United States and in other important non-U.S. markets remains uncertain and is dependent upon the scope of protection decided upon by the patent offices, courts and lawmakers in those countries. We can provide no assurance that we will successfully obtain or preserve patent protection for the technologies incorporated into our products and processes, or that the scope of patent protection obtained will be sufficient to protect our commercial interests in all countries where we conduct business. If we cannot prevent others from exploiting our inventions, we will not derive the benefit from them that we currently expect.\nWe exclusively license, under an agreement with Amunix, the XTEN technology that is used in connection with certain of our pipeline product candidates. If that agreement were to be terminated or if we otherwise lost our rights to such technology, our ability to develop, manufacture and commercialize such product candidates could be adversely affected, and could materially harm our business prospects.\nWe also rely on regulatory exclusivity for protection of our products. Implementation and enforcement of regulatory exclusivity varies widely from country to country. Failure to qualify for regulatory exclusivity, or failure to obtain or maintain the extent or duration of such protections that we expect for our products in each of these markets due to challenges, changes of interpretations in the law or otherwise, could affect the revenue for our products, our decision on whether to market our products in a particular country or countries or could otherwise have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nAdditionally, we rely in part on confidentiality and non-use agreements with our employees, consultants, collaborators and other business partners to protect our proprietary technology and processes. If any of these individuals or entities breaches their confidentiality, non-use or similar agreements with us, we may not have adequate remedies for that breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors and even patented by them. If that happens, the potential competitive advantages provided by our intellectual property may be adversely affected. We may then need to license such competing technologies, and we may not be able to obtain licenses on reasonable terms, if at all, which could cause material harm to our business. Moreover, to the extent that our employees, consultants, parties to collaboration agreements and other business partners use intellectual property owned by others in their work for the company, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.\nOur success also depends in part on our, and on the people with whom we collaborate and do business, not infringing patents and proprietary rights of others, and not breaching any licenses or other agreements that we or they have entered into with regard to our technologies, products and business. We cannot be certain that patents have not or will not be issued to others that would block our ability to obtain patents or to operate our business as we would like or at all. There may be patents in some countries that, if valid and if we are unsuccessful in circumventing or acquiring rights to them, could block our ability to commercialize products in those countries. There also may be claims in patent applications filed in some countries that, if granted and valid, and if we are unable to circumvent or license them, could also block our ability to commercialize products or processes in those countries.\nLitigation, interferences, oppositions, inter partes reviews or other proceedings are, and may in the future be, necessary in some instances to determine the validity and scope of certain of our proprietary rights, and in other instances to determine the validity, scope or non-infringement of certain patent rights claimed by third parties to be pertinent to the manufacture, use or sale of our products. Patent-related claims could include challenges to the scope and validity of our patents on products or processes as well as allegations that our products infringe patents held by competitors or others. We may also face challenges to regulatory or patent protections covering our products by manufacturers of biosimilars that may choose to launch or attempt to launch their products before the expiration of our regulatory or patent exclusivity.\nBiogen received communications from a third party, Pfizer, regarding a proposal that Biogen take a license to Pfizer's U.S. Patent No. 8,603,777 (Expression of Factor VII and IX Activities in Mammalian Cells) and pay royalties on past and future sales of ALPROLIX. There is no pending litigation with Pfizer and an estimate of a possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. We do not believe this patent would adversely affect our ability to sell ALPROLIX; however, we cannot assure you that we would ultimately prevail if this or any other intellectual property\ninfringement claim is asserted against us, and we may receive in the future other communications from third parties claiming infringement of third party intellectual property rights.\nThe disposition of claims or proceedings is unpredictable and, regardless of the merits or the outcome, may be protracted, expensive and distracting to management. Moreover, the disposition and outcome of any such claims or proceedings could adversely affect the validity and scope of our patent or other proprietary rights; hinder our ability to manufacture, market and sell our products; lead to attempts on the part of other parties to pursue similar claims; force us to redesign those products or processes that use any allegedly infringing or misappropriated technology, which may result in significant cost or delay to us, or which the redesign of could be technically infeasible; require us to seek a license for the impacted product or technology and pay royalties; or result in the assessment of significant monetary damages against us that may exceed amounts, if any, accrued in our financial statements, including the possibility of treble damages in a patent case if a court finds us to have willfully infringed certain intellectual property rights. In addition, payments under any licenses that we are able to obtain would reduce our profits derived from the covered products and services. Furthermore, many of our collaboration agreements, including with Sobi, require us to indemnify the collaboration parties for third party intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase the cost to us of any such claim. Any of these adverse effects may be material and, consequently, may adversely impact our cash flow, financial position and results of operations.\nOur sales and operations are subject to the risks of doing business in Japan and other international markets, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are increasing our presence in Japan, Canada and other non-U.S. markets, including in emerging markets, which subjects us to many risks that could adversely affect our business and revenues, such as:\n\u2022 the inability to obtain necessary regulatory or pricing approvals of products in a timely manner;\n\u2022 differing local product preferences and product requirements;\n\u2022 changes in medical reimbursement policies and programs;\n\u2022 fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, in particular the recent strength of the U.S. dollar versus foreign currencies;\n\u2022 difficulties in staffing and managing non-U.S. operations;\n\u2022 uncertainties regarding the collectability of accounts receivable;\n\u2022 differing and increased labor regulations, including non-U.S. work councils;\n\u2022 the imposition of governmental controls;\n\u2022 less favorable intellectual property or other applicable laws;\n\u2022 increasingly complex standards for complying with non-U.S. laws and regulations that may differ substantially from country to country and may conflict with corresponding U.S. laws and regulations;\n\u2022 government involvement in funding health care in major overseas markets;\n\u2022 the far-reaching anti-bribery and anti-corruption legislation in the United Kingdom and elsewhere, including the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, and the escalation of investigations and prosecutions pursuant to such laws;\n\u2022 compliance with complex import and export control laws;\n\u2022 restrictions on direct investments by non-U.S. entities and trade restrictions;\n\u2022 greater political or economic instability; and\n\u2022 changes in tax laws and tariffs.\nWe cannot guarantee that our efforts to initiate or expand sales in these markets will succeed. Some non-U.S. markets may be especially vulnerable to periods of financial instability or may have very limited resources to spend on health care. To successfully implement our strategy in non-U.S. markets, we must attract and retain qualified personnel or may be required to increase our reliance on third party distributors within those markets. In addition, many of the countries in emerging markets have currencies that fluctuate substantially. If such currencies devalue and we cannot offset the devaluations, our financial performance within those countries could be adversely affected. In addition, price and currency exchange controls, limitations on participation in local enterprises, expropriation, nationalization and other governmental actions could affect our business and results of operations in these markets.\nIn addition, our non-U.S. operations are subject to regulation under U.S. law. For example, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) prohibits U.S. companies and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business abroad. In many countries, the health care professionals we regularly interact with may meet the definition of a foreign government official for purposes of the FCPA. Failure to comply with U.S. or non-U.S. laws could result in various adverse consequences, including: possible delay in approval or refusal to approve a product; recalls, seizures or withdrawal of an approved product from the market; disruption in the supply or availability of our products or suspension of export or import privileges; the imposition of civil or criminal sanctions; the prosecution of executives overseeing our international operations; and damage to our reputation. Any significant impairment of our ability to sell products outside of the U.S. could adversely impact our business and financial results.\nDevelopment of our product candidates is expensive and uncertain. If we are unable to successfully develop and test our product candidates, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects will be harmed.\nA part of our long-term strategy is the continued development of marketed products and our product pipeline programs. The research and development of biological products is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties and requires significant capital expenditures and management resources. Only a small percentage of product candidates that enter the development process ever receive regulatory approval. The process of conducting the preclinical and clinical testing required to establish safety and efficacy and obtain regulatory approval is expensive and uncertain and takes many years. The FDA and non-U.S. regulatory agencies generally require pre-clinical (animal) testing as well as multiple stages of clinical (human) testing before a product gains regulatory approval, and failure may occur at any stage of testing. It is possible that positive results in a trial may not be replicated in subsequent or confirmatory trials, and success in preclinical work or early stage clinical trials does not ensure that later stage or larger scale clinical trials will be successful or that regulatory approval will be obtained. Furthermore, our ability to commence and complete clinical trials may be delayed, and our existing trials may be stopped, due to various factors, including: variability in the number and types of patients available for each study; difficulty in maintaining contact with patients after treatment, resulting in incomplete data, unforeseen safety issues or side effects; varying interpretations of clinical trial data; poor or unanticipated effectiveness of candidates during clinical trials; and government or regulatory delays.\nThese risks are enhanced by our reliance on third parties for aspects of the research and development process. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties to store and distribute drug supplies for our clinical trials as well as CROs, clinical data management organizations, medical institutions and clinical investigators to conduct and manage our preclinical and clinical trials and to\naccurately report their results. Reduced control over these activities may impact our ability to control the timing, conduct, expense, reliability and quality of our clinical trials, but does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibility for trials that we sponsor. For example, we remain responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trial as well as regulatory standards such as current cGCPs. Failure to fully comply with the study protocol or applicable regulations or regulatory standards could result in the clinical data generated in those studies being deemed unreliable. This failure may also result in the rejection of our product candidates by the FDA or a non-U.S. regulatory agency, or may result in our having to conduct additional audits or require additional clinical studies, which would delay our development programs, require us to incur additional costs and could substantially harm our business and financial condition. If the third parties we rely on for research and development activities do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, do not meet expected deadlines, experience work stoppages, terminate their agreements with us, need to be replaced or do not conduct our clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated protocols, we may need to enter into new arrangements with alternative third parties, which could be difficult, costly or impossible. As a result, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed, terminated or may need to be repeated.\nEven if we are able to successfully develop new products or indications, sales of new products or products with additional indications may not meet expectations. Our products may not achieve an adequate level of acceptance in the medical community until longer-term clinical data or other factors demonstrate their safety and efficacy as compared to other alternative treatments. We may also make a strategic decision to discontinue development of a product or indication if, for example, we believe commercialization will be difficult relative to the standard of care or other opportunities in our pipeline.\nThe occurrence of any of these events could result in significant costs and expenses and lost market opportunities.\nIf our business development activities are unsuccessful, our business could suffer and our financial performance could be adversely affected.\nWe intend to engage in business development activities, including evaluating potential acquisitions, strategic alliances, collaborations, technology licensing arrangements and other opportunities. These activities may require a substantial investment of our resources, with no certainty of success. Our success developing products or expanding our product portfolio from such business development activities will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022 our ability to find suitable opportunities for acquisition, investment or alliance;\n\u2022 whether we are able to complete an acquisition, investment or alliance on terms that are satisfactory to us;\n\u2022 the strength of the technology and products being licensed or acquired;\n\u2022 any intellectual property and litigation related to these products or technology;\n\u2022 our ability to successfully integrate the acquired company, business, product, technology or research into our existing operations, including the ability to adequately fund acquired in-process research and development projects and to maintain adequate controls over the combined operations; and\n\u2022 our ability to access capital markets or incur indebtedness at terms that are satisfactory to us.\nIf we are unsuccessful in our business development activities, we may be unable to grow or meet our financial targets and our business and financial performance could be adversely affected.\nWe depend on relationships with collaborators and other third parties for revenue, and for the development, regulatory approval, commercialization and marketing of certain products, which are outside our full control. If our collaborative efforts are unsuccessful, our commercialization strategies or product development may be delayed, which could have an adverse impact on our business, prospects and results of operations.\nWe rely, and expect to continue to rely, on a number of significant collaborative and other third party relationships for revenue, and for the development, regulatory approval, commercialization and marketing of our products and product candidates. These third parties may include other biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies, academic and research institutions, governments and government agencies and other public and private research organizations. For example, in addition to our collaboration with Sobi, we are pursuing programs with other third parties in hemophilia A and hemophilia B using XTEN technology, gene therapy, gene editing and non-factor bi-specific antibodies, as well as other rare blood disorders.\nReliance on collaborative and other third party relationships subjects us to a number of risks, including:\n\u2022 we may be unable to control the resources our collaborator devotes to our programs or product candidates;\n\u2022 disputes may arise with respect to ownership of rights to technology developed with our collaborator, and the underlying contract with our collaborator may fail to provide us with significant protection or may fail to be effectively enforced if the collaborator fails to perform;\n\u2022 our collaborators' interests may not always be aligned with our interests and a collaborator may not pursue regulatory approvals or market a product in the same manner or to the same extent that we would, which could adversely affect our revenues;\n\u2022 the failure to effectively cooperate with our collaborators could adversely affect product sales or the clinical development or regulatory approvals of product candidates under joint control and could also result in termination of the research, development or commercialization of product candidates, litigation or arbitration; and\n\u2022 any failure on the part of our collaborator to comply with applicable laws and regulatory requirements in the marketing, sale and maintenance of the market authorization of our products or to fulfill any responsibilities our collaborator may have to protect and enforce any intellectual property rights underlying our products or product candidates could have an adverse effect on our revenues and involve us in legal proceedings.\nGiven these risks, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the success of our current and future collaborative efforts. If these efforts fail, our product development or commercialization of new products could be delayed or revenues from products could decline.\nIf we or third parties with whom we do business fail to comply with the extensive legal and regulatory requirements affecting the health care industry, we could face increased costs, penalties and harm to our business.\nOur activities, and the activities of our collaborators, distributors and other third party providers, are subject to extensive government regulation and oversight both in the U.S. and in non-U.S. jurisdictions.\nTo be approved for marketing, a potential product must undergo lengthy and rigorous testing and other extensive, costly and time-consuming procedures mandated by the FDA and non-U.S. regulatory authorities. Satisfaction of these regulatory requirements typically takes many years. Moreover, regulatory oversight continues to apply after product marketing approval and covers, among other things, testing, manufacturing, distribution, quality control, labeling, advertising, promotion, risk\nmitigation and adverse event reporting requirements. Our facilities, or those of third parties on which we rely, must be licensed prior to production and remain subject to inspection from time to time thereafter. Separately, if previously unknown problems occur with regards to our marketed products, any of our products may have to be withdrawn from the market or subject to restrictions. Regulatory agencies may also require additional clinical trials or testing for our products, and our products may be recalled or may be subject to reformulation, changes in labeling, warnings to the public and negative publicity. We are relying on Biogen for a period following the effective time of the distribution to supply and distribute our products to customers while we obtain appropriate regulatory authorizations in certain jurisdictions, such as the United States and Canada. In the United States, we are in the process of securing a Department of Health and Human Services United States License Number, certain state authorizations and other regulatory and government authorizations. In Canada, we are in the process of applying for additional licenses, including a Drug Establishment License from Health Canada. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain or maintain regulatory approval to market or engage in distribution or other activities regarding our products.\nFurther, even if we are successful in gaining regulatory approval of any of our product candidates, the extent to which we are able to commercialize the product may be less than we anticipate. Regulatory authorities may grant marketing approval that is more restricted than anticipated. These restrictions may include limiting indications to narrow patient populations and imposing safety monitoring, educational requirements and REMS. In addition, if we seek to expand or change the use of any of our marketed products, those changes may be subject to vigorous review and include multiple regulatory submissions, and approvals are not certain.\nIn addition to FDA and related regulatory requirements, we are subject to health care \"fraud and abuse\" laws governing our interactions in the U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions with physicians or other health care providers that prescribe or purchase our products. In the United States, these laws include the federal False Claims Act, the anti-kickback provisions of the federal Social Security Act, the Physician Payment Sunshine provisions, and other state and federal laws and regulations. In both the United States and other jurisdictions, health care companies such as ours are facing heightened scrutiny of their relationships with health care providers from anti-corruption enforcement officials and private individuals. Many biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies have been the target of lawsuits and investigations alleging violations of government regulation, including claims asserting submission of incorrect pricing information, impermissible off-label promotion of biotechnology and biopharmaceutical products, payments intended to influence the referral of health care business, submission of false claims for government reimbursement, antitrust violations or violations related to environmental matters. There also recently has been enhanced scrutiny of company-sponsored patient assistance programs, including insurance premium and co-pay assistance programs and donations to third party charities that provide such assistance. If we, or our vendors or donation recipients, fail to comply with relevant laws, regulations or government guidance in the operation of these programs, we could be subject to significant fines or penalties. Our risks under health care fraud and abuse laws may be heightened as we continue to expand our global operations and if we enter new therapeutic areas with different patient populations, which may have product distribution methods distinct from those we currently utilize.\nViolations of governmental regulation, such as a failed inspection or a failure in our adverse event reporting system, or any health care fraud and abuse law may be punishable by criminal, civil and administrative sanctions against us as well as against executives overseeing our business. These may include adverse inspection reports; refusal to grant approvals or licenses; warning letters; fines and civil monetary penalties; withdrawal of regulatory approval or licenses; interruption of production; operating restrictions; product recall or seizure; injunctions; criminal prosecution and exclusion from participation in government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, as well as against executives overseeing our business. In addition to penalties for violation of laws and regulations, we could be required to repay\namounts we received from government payors, or pay additional rebates and interest if we are found to have miscalculated the pricing information we have submitted to the government. We cannot ensure that our compliance controls, policies and procedures will, in every instance, protect us from acts committed by our employees, collaborators, partners or third party providers that would violate the laws or regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Whether or not we have complied with the law, an investigation into alleged unlawful conduct could increase our expenses, damage our reputation, divert management time and attention and adversely affect our business. Any of these actions could cause a loss of confidence in us and our products, which could adversely affect our sales. Even if it is later determined that we are not in violation of these laws, we may be faced with negative publicity, incur significant expenses defending our position and have to divert significant management resources from other matters.\nOur business and results of operations may be adversely affected by current and potential future health care reforms.\nIn the United States, federal and state legislatures, health agencies and third party payors continue to focus on containing the cost of health care. Legislative and regulatory proposals and enactments to reform health care insurance programs could significantly influence the manner in which our products are prescribed and purchased. For example, provisions of the PPACA have resulted in changes in the way health care is paid for by both governmental and private insurers in the United States, including increased rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, annual fees and taxes on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs, the requirement that manufacturers participate in a discount program for certain outpatient drugs under Medicare Part D and the expansion of the number of hospitals eligible for discounts under Section 340B of the Public Health Service Act. These changes have had and are expected to continue to have a significant impact on our business. In 2017, we face uncertainties as a result of federal and administrative efforts to repeal, substantially modify or invalidate or replace some or all of the provisions of the PPACA. There is no assurance that the PPACA, as currently enacted or as amended or replaced in the future, will not adversely affect our business and financial results, and we cannot predict how future federal or state legislative or administrative changes relating to healthcare reform will affect our business.\nThere is also significant economic pressure on U.S. state budgets that may result in states increasingly seeking to achieve budget savings through mechanisms that limit coverage or payment for our drugs. In recent years, some states have considered legislation and ballot initiatives that would control the prices of drugs, including laws to allow importation of biotechnology and biopharmaceutical products from lower cost jurisdictions outside of the United States. and laws intended to impose price controls on state drug purchases. State Medicaid programs are increasingly requesting manufacturers pay supplemental rebates and requiring prior authorization by the state program for use of any drug for which supplemental rebates are not paid. Government efforts to reduce Medicaid expenses may lead to increased use of managed care organizations by Medicaid programs. This may result in managed care organizations influencing prescription decisions for a larger segment of the population and a corresponding constraint on prices and reimbursement for our products.\nIn the European Union and some other non-U.S. markets, the government provides health care at low cost to consumers and regulates biotechnology and biopharmaceutical prices, patient eligibility or reimbursement levels to control costs for the government-sponsored health care system. Many countries have announced or implemented measures to reduce health care costs to constrain their overall level of government expenditures. These measures vary by country and may include, among other things, patient access restrictions, suspensions on price increases, prospective and possibly retroactive price reductions and other recoupments and increased mandatory discounts or rebates, recoveries of past price increases and greater importation of drugs from lower-cost countries. These measures have\nnegatively impacted our revenues and may continue to adversely affect our revenues and results of operations in the future.\nIf we fail to attract and retain key personnel, our business may suffer.\nOur success depends in large part upon the leadership and performance of our management team and other key employees. Operating as an independent company will demand a significant amount of time and effort from our management and other employees and may give rise to increased employee turnover. If we lose the services of members of our management team or other key employees, we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our business objectives.\nOur ability to attract, recruit and retain such talent will depend on a number of factors, including the hiring practices of our competitors, the performance of our commercial products and pipeline programs, our compensation and benefits, work location and work environment and economic conditions affecting our industry generally. If we cannot effectively hire and retain qualified employees, our business, results of operations and prospects could suffer.\nA breakdown or breach of our technology systems could subject us to liability or interrupt the operation of our business.\nWe are increasingly dependent upon technology systems and data, many of which are new or unfamiliar systems. Our intellectual property, computer systems, other proprietary technology and other sensitive company data is potentially vulnerable to loss, damage or misappropriation from system malfunction, computer viruses, unauthorized access to data or misappropriation or misuse thereof by those with permitted access and other events. Likewise, data privacy or security breaches by individuals authorized to access our technology systems or others may pose a risk that sensitive data, including intellectual property, trade secrets or personal information belonging to us, our patients, customers or other business partners, may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. The increasing use and evolution of technology, including cloud-based computing, creates additional opportunities for the unintentional dissemination of information and the intentional destruction of confidential information stored in the company's systems or in non-encrypted portable media or storage devices. Cyber attacks are increasing in their frequency, sophistication and intensity. While we continue to build and improve our systems and infrastructure and take appropriate security measures to reduce these risks to our intellectual property, data and information technology systems, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent breakdowns, breaches, cyber incidents or other events. Such events could have a negative effect on our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations. Further, the misappropriation or other loss of our intellectual property from any of the foregoing could have an adverse effect on our competitive position and may cause us to incur substantial litigation costs.\nOur business involves environmental risks, which include the cost of compliance and the risk of contamination or injury, which could harm our business.\nOur business and the business of several of our third party contractors involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals, biologics and radioactive compounds. Although we believe that our and their safety procedures for the handling and disposing of such materials comply with state, federal and non-U.S. laws and standards, there will always be the risk of accidental contamination or injury. If we were to become liable for an accident, or if a facility in which our products or product candidates were manufactured suffered an extended shutdown, we could incur significant costs, damages or penalties that could harm our business. Manufacturing, distribution and disposal of our products and product candidates also requires compliance with environmental laws and may require permits from government agencies, including governmental authorizations or permits for water supply, wastewater discharge and waste disposal. If we or our contract parties do not obtain or comply with appropriate\npermits and other requirements of environmental laws, we or they could incur significant penalties and other costs and limits on manufacturing volumes that could harm our business.\nSignificant legal proceedings may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nWe are subject to the risk of litigation, derivative claims, securities class actions, regulatory and governmental investigations and other proceedings, including proceedings arising from investor dissatisfaction with us or our performance. If any claims were brought against us and resulted in a finding of substantial legal liability, the finding could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations or cause significant reputational harm to us, which could seriously adversely impact our business. Allegations of improper conduct by private litigants or regulators, regardless of veracity, may harm our reputation and adversely impact our ability to grow our business.\nRisks Related to the Separation\nWe may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of the separation, and the separation could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to achieve some or all of the anticipated strategic, financial, operational, marketing or other benefits expected to result from the separation, or such benefits may be delayed or not occur at all. For example, we have undertaken and are undertaking strategic, structural and process realignment actions within our operations. These actions may not provide the benefits we currently expect, and could lead to disruption of our operations, loss of or inability to recruit, key personnel needed to operate and grow our businesses following the separation, weakening of our internal standards, controls or procedures and impairment of our key customer and supplier relationships.\nBy separating from Biogen, we may become more susceptible to market fluctuations and other adverse events than we would have been if we were still a part of the current Biogen organizational structure. As part of Biogen, we were able to enjoy certain benefits from Biogen's operating diversity, purchasing power and opportunities to pursue integrated strategies with Biogen's other businesses. As an independent, publicly traded company, we do not have similar diversity or integration opportunities and may not have similar purchasing power or access to capital markets. Additionally, as part of Biogen, we were able to leverage Biogen's historical market reputation, performance and brand identity to recruit and retain key personnel to run our business. As an independent, publicly traded company, we do not have the same historical market reputation and performance or brand identity as Biogen. If we fail to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve as an independent company, or do not achieve them in the time we expect, our business, operating results, financial condition or prospects may suffer.\nWe may be unable to make, on a timely or cost-effective basis, the changes necessary to operate as an independent company, and we will be reliant on Biogen for the provision of certain services for a period of time.\nWe have historically operated as part of Biogen's corporate organization, and Biogen assisted us by providing various corporate and other business functions. Following the separation, Biogen has no obligation to provide us with assistance other than providing certain services pursuant to agreements described in, Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions. If Biogen is unable or unwilling to satisfy its obligations under these agreements, we could incur operational difficulties or losses that could have a material and adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe services to be provided by Biogen do not include every service or all of the information and technology systems that we have received from Biogen in the past, and Biogen is only obligated to provide these services for limited periods of time from the distribution date. Accordingly, following the\nseparation, we will need to provide internally or obtain from unaffiliated third parties the systems and services we currently receive from Biogen.\nIf we do not have in place our own systems and services, including technology systems and services, or if we do not have agreements with other providers of these services in a timely manner or on terms and conditions as favorable as those we receive from Biogen, we may not be able to operate our business effectively and our profitability may decline. Furthermore, if we fail to obtain the quality of services necessary to operate effectively or incur greater costs in obtaining these services, our profitability, operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe have only operated as an independent company since February 1, 2017, and we expect to incur increased administrative and other costs following the separation by virtue of our status as an independent public company. Our historical financial information is not necessarily representative of the results that we would have achieved as a separate, publicly traded company and should not be relied upon as an indicator of our future results.\nThe historical information of Bioverativ included in this report refers to our business as operated by and integrated with Biogen and is derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of Biogen. Accordingly, the historical financial information included in this report does not necessarily reflect the operating results, financial condition or cash flows that we would have achieved as a separate, publicly traded company during the periods presented or what we will achieve in the future primarily as a result of the following factors, among others:\n\u2022 Prior to the separation, our business was operated by Biogen as part of its broader corporate organization, rather than as an independent company. Biogen, or one of its affiliates, performed various corporate functions for us, including executive oversight, treasury, finance, legal, human resources, tax planning, internal audit, financial reporting, information technology, investor relations, shared services, insurance, employee benefits and incentives and share-based compensation. Following the separation, Biogen has continued to provide some of these functions to Bioverativ, as described in Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions. Our historical financial results reflect allocations of corporate expenses from Biogen for such functions, which are likely to be less than the expenses we would have incurred had we operated as a separate, publicly traded company. Following the separation, our costs related to such functions previously provided by Biogen will likely increase.\n\u2022 Historically, we shared economies of scope and scale in costs, employees, vendor relationships and customer relationships with Biogen. Although we have entered into certain agreements with Biogen in connection with the separation, these arrangements may not fully capture the benefits that we have enjoyed as a result of being integrated with Biogen and may result in us incurring higher costs than in the past.\n\u2022 Following the separation, we may lose certain synergies and benefits we enjoyed as a result of being a part of Biogen. As a part of Biogen, we benefited from, among other things, access to potential new customers from Biogen and capital to fund acquisitions and investments. In addition, being a part of Biogen enabled us to leverage Biogen's technological capabilities, data and commerce platforms.\n\u2022 Generally, prior to the separation, our working capital requirements and capital for our general corporate purposes, including acquisitions and capital expenditures, were satisfied as part of the corporate-wide cash management policies of Biogen. Following the separation, we may need to obtain additional financing from banks, through public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities, or through strategic relationships or other arrangements, which may or may not be available and may be more costly.\n\u2022 After the separation, the cost of capital of our business may be higher than Biogen's cost of capital prior to the separation.\n\u2022 Our historical financial information does not reflect our obligations to purchase from Biogen certain operations and assets, and assume the corresponding liabilities, of Biogen's business after the separation date.\nOther significant changes may occur in our cost structure, management, financing and business operations as a result of operating as a company separate from Biogen. For additional information about the past financial performance of our business and the basis of preparation of the historical consolidated financial statements of our business, see Item 6. Selected Financial Data, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and our financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this report.\nThe separation may result in disruptions to, and negatively impact our relationships with, our customers and other business partners.\nUncertainty related to the separation may lead customers and other parties with which we currently do business or may do business in the future to terminate or attempt to negotiate changes in our existing business relationships, or cause them to delay entering into business relationships with us or consider entering into business relationships with parties other than us. These disruptions could have a material and adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects. The effect of such disruptions could be exacerbated by any delays in the completion of the separation.\nOur accounting and other management systems and resources may not be adequately prepared to meet the financial reporting and other requirements to which we are subject following the distribution.\nOur financial results historically were included within the consolidated results of Biogen, and until the distribution occurred, we were not directly subject to reporting and other requirements of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. We currently qualify as an \"emerging growth company\" and for so long as we remain so qualified we will be exempt from Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which requires auditor attestation to the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. We are, however, immediately subject to Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. At such time as we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, we will be broadly subject to reporting and other requirements under the Exchange Act and Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which will require, among other things, annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and a report by our independent registered public accounting firm addressing these assessments. These and other obligations will place significant demands on our management, administrative and operational resources, including accounting and information technology resources. To comply with these requirements, we anticipate that we will need to further upgrade our systems, including duplicating computer hardware infrastructure, implement additional financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures and hire additional accounting, finance and information technology staff. If we are unable to do this in a timely and effective fashion, our ability to comply with our financial reporting requirements and other rules that apply to reporting companies could be impaired and our business could be harmed.\nIf the distribution, together with certain related transactions, does not qualify as a transaction that is tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, Biogen and its stockholders could be subject to significant tax liabilities, and we could be required to indemnify Biogen for material taxes pursuant to indemnification obligations under the tax matters agreement.\nCompletion of the separation from Biogen was conditioned on the receipt by Biogen of an opinion from Biogen's tax counsel or other third party advisor regarding the qualification of the distribution, together with certain related transactions, as a transaction that will qualify under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code). Except as otherwise noted, it is expected that the distribution will qualify as a transaction that is tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes to Biogen and the holders of Biogen common stock. The opinion was received and was based on and relied on, among other things, certain facts and assumptions, as well as certain representations, statements and undertakings of us and Biogen, including those relating to the past and future conduct of us and Biogen. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations, statements or undertakings are, or become, inaccurate or incomplete, or if we or Biogen breach any of our respective covenants in the separation documents, the opinion of counsel may be invalid and the conclusions reached therein could be jeopardized.\nNotwithstanding the opinion of counsel, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) could determine on audit that the distribution, together with certain related transactions, is taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations, statements or undertakings are incorrect or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion of counsel. An opinion of counsel is not binding on the IRS or any court and there can be no assurance that the IRS will not challenge the conclusions reached in the opinion.\nIf the distribution, together with certain related transactions, is ultimately determined to be taxable, Biogen and its stockholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax could incur significant tax liabilities. For example, if the distribution fails to qualify for tax-free treatment, Biogen would, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, be treated as if it had sold our common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value, and those Biogen stockholders who are subject to U.S. federal income tax would be treated as receiving a taxable distribution in an amount equal to the fair market value of our common stock received in the distribution.\nUnder the tax matters agreement we entered into with Biogen, we would potentially be required to indemnify Biogen against taxes incurred by Biogen that arise as a result of our taking or failing to take, as the case may be, certain actions that result in the distribution failing to meet the requirements of a tax-free distribution under Section 355 of the Code. If we are required to indemnify Biogen under the circumstances set forth in the tax matters agreement, we may be subject to substantial liabilities, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe will be subject to numerous restrictions to preserve the tax-free treatment of the transactions in the United States, which may reduce our strategic and operating flexibility.\nOur ability to engage in significant equity transactions could be limited or restricted after the distribution in order to preserve, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the tax-free nature of the distribution by Biogen. Even if the distribution otherwise qualifies for tax-free treatment, the distribution may result in corporate-level taxable gain to Biogen under Section 355(e) of the Code if 50% or more, by vote or value, of shares of our stock or Biogen's stock are acquired or issued as part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the distribution. The process for determining whether an acquisition or issuance triggering these provisions has occurred is complex, inherently factual and subject to interpretation of the facts and circumstances of a particular case. Any acquisitions or issuances of our stock or Biogen's stock within a two-year period after the distribution generally are presumed to be part of such a plan, although we or Biogen, as applicable, may be able to\nrebut that presumption. Accordingly, under the tax matters agreement that we entered into with Biogen, for the two-year period following the distribution, we will be prohibited, except in certain circumstances, from:\n\u2022 entering into any transactions resulting in the acquisition of 40% or more of our stock or substantially all of our assets, whether by merger or otherwise;\n\u2022 merging, consolidating or liquidating;\n\u2022 issuing equity securities beyond certain thresholds;\n\u2022 repurchasing our capital stock; or\n\u2022 ceasing to actively conduct our business.\nThese restrictions may limit our ability to pursue certain strategic transactions or other transactions that we may believe to otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders or that might increase the value of our business. In addition, under the tax matters agreement, we will be required to indemnify Biogen against any such tax liabilities as a result of the acquisition of our stock or assets, even if we do not participate in or otherwise facilitate the acquisition.\nOur agreements with Biogen may not reflect terms that would have resulted from negotiations with unaffiliated third parties.\nThe agreements we entered into with Biogen related to the separation, including, among others, the separation agreement, the tax matters agreement and the transition services agreement, were entered into in the context of the separation while we were still controlled by Biogen. Until the distribution occurred, Biogen effectively had the sole and absolute discretion to determine and change the terms of the separation, including the terms of any agreements between Biogen and us and the establishment of the record date and distribution date. As a result, the terms of such agreements may not reflect terms that would have resulted from negotiations between unaffiliated third parties.\nWe will be subject to continuing contingent tax related liabilities of Biogen following the distribution.\nAfter the distribution, there are several significant areas where the liabilities of Biogen may become our obligations. For example, under the Code and the related rules and regulations, each corporation that was a member of Biogen's consolidated tax reporting group during any taxable period or portion of any taxable period is jointly and severally liable for the U.S. federal income tax liability of the entire consolidated tax reporting group for such taxable period. The tax matters agreement we entered into with Biogen allocates the responsibility for prior period taxes of Biogen's consolidated tax reporting group between us and Biogen. If Biogen were unable to pay any prior period taxes for which it is responsible, however, under applicable law we could be required to pay the entire amount of such taxes, and such amounts could be significant. Other provisions of federal, state, local or foreign law may establish similar liability for other matters, including laws governing tax-qualified pension plans, as well as other contingent liabilities.\nIn connection with the separation, we assumed and agreed to indemnify Biogen for certain liabilities. If we are required to make payments pursuant to these indemnities to Biogen, we may need to divert cash to meet those obligations and our financial results could be negatively impacted.\nPursuant to the separation agreement and certain other agreements we entered into with Biogen, we assumed and agreed to indemnify Biogen for certain liabilities for uncapped amounts, which may include, among other items, associated defense costs, settlement amounts and judgments Payments pursuant to these indemnities may be significant and could negatively impact our business, particularly indemnities relating to our actions that could impact the tax-free nature of the distribution and certain\nrelated transactions. Third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities of the Biogen business. Biogen agreed to indemnify us for liabilities of the Biogen business, but such indemnity from Biogen may not be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, and Biogen may not fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. Moreover, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from Biogen any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves. Each of these risks could negatively affect our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe market price for our common stock may fluctuate widely.\nThe market price of our shares of common stock may fluctuate widely, depending upon many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including the following:\n\u2022 our quarterly or annual earnings, or those of other comparable companies;\n\u2022 actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022 changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u2022 announcements by us or our competitors of significant investments, acquisitions or dispositions;\n\u2022 the failure of securities analysts to cover our shares of common stock after the distribution;\n\u2022 changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates;\n\u2022 the operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies;\n\u2022 overall market fluctuations; and\n\u2022 general economic conditions.\nStock markets in general often experience volatility that is unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our shares of common stock. You may not be able to resell your shares of common stock following periods of volatility because of the market's adverse reaction to volatility. When the market price of a company's common stock drops significantly, stockholders often institute securities class action lawsuits against the company. This type of lawsuit against us could cause us to incur substantial costs and could divert the time and attention of management and other resources.\nFuture sales or distributions of our common stock could cause the market price of shares of our common stock to decline.\nAs a result of the separation, Biogen distributed approximately 108 million shares of our common stock to its stockholders, all of which are freely tradeable without restriction or further registration under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), unless the shares are owned by one of our affiliates, as that term is defined in Rule 405 of the Securities Act. The sale of significant amounts of our shares or the perception in the market that this will occur may result in the lowering of the market price of our shares. We can offer no assurance that Biogen's stockholders will continue to hold the shares they received in the distribution.\nYour percentage ownership in the company may be diluted in the future.\nIn the future, your percentage ownership in the company may be diluted because of equity issuances for acquisitions, capital market transactions or otherwise, including equity awards that we grant to our directors, officers and employees. Such awards will have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. From time to time, we issue stock options or other share-based awards to employees under our employee benefits plans.\nIn addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designation, powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights, including preferences over the company's common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as the board of directors generally may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock. For example, we could grant the holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock.\nThe public announcement of data from clinical studies or news of any developments related to our or our competitors' products or pipeline may cause significant volatility in our stock price.\nAs we evolve into a standalone company, we will be focusing efforts and resources on further commercializing our existing products, as well as building a diversified pipeline of products into areas of unmet medical need. We expect that investors may place heightened scrutiny on some of our products in development when making investment decisions in the company compared to how such product developments relating to our business were previously viewed by investors when such programs part of the larger Biogen. The announcement of data from clinical studies by us or our collaborators or news of any developments related to our or our competitors' products or pipeline may cause significant volatility in our stock price. Furthermore, the announcement of any negative or unexpected data or the discontinuation of development of any of our key pipeline product candidates, or any delay in anticipated timelines for filing for regulatory approval, could cause our stock price to decline significantly.\nWe do not expect to declare any dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe do not anticipate declaring any cash dividends to holders of our common stock in the foreseeable future. Consequently, stockholders must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on the value of their shares of our common stock.\nProvisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain certain provisions that could have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition deemed undesirable by our board of directors. For example, our corporate governance documents include provisions:\n\u2022 authorizing blank check preferred stock, which could be issued with voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to our common stock;\n\u2022 limiting the liability of, and providing indemnification to, our directors and officers;\n\u2022 limiting the ability of our stockholders to call and bring business before special meetings;\n\u2022 eliminating the ability of our stockholders to act by written consent in lieu of a meeting;\n\u2022 requiring advance notice of stockholder proposals for business to be conducted at meetings of our stockholders and for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors; and\n\u2022 limiting the determination of the number of directors on our board of directors and the filling of newly created seats on the board to our board of directors then in office.\nThese provisions, alone or together, could delay hostile takeovers and changes in control of our company or changes in our management.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (DGCL), which prevents some stockholders holding more than 15% of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of substantially all of our outstanding common stock. Any provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\nIn addition, an acquisition or further issuance of our stock could trigger the application of Section 355(e) of the Code. Under the tax matters agreement, we would be required to indemnify Biogen for any resulting taxes, and this indemnity obligation might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control that our stockholders may consider favorable.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the state courts of the State of Delaware, or, if no state court located in the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal court for the District of Delaware, as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could discourage lawsuits against us and our directors and officers.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, to the fullest extent permitted by law, will be the sole and exclusive forum for:\n\u2022 any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of us;\n\u2022 any action asserting a claim for breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees of the company to us or our stockholders;\n\u2022 any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL; or\n\u2022 any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine under Delaware state corporate law.\nThis exclusive forum provision may limit the ability of our stockholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such stockholders find favorable for disputes with us or our directors or officers, which may discourage such lawsuits against the company and our directors and officers. Alternatively, if a court outside of Delaware were to find this exclusive forum provision inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings described above, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition.", "PERMNO": 16544, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "BIVV"}
