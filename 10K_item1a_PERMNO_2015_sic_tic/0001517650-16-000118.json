{"cik": "1517650", "company": "Interactive Intelligence Group, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-29", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nThe following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and presented elsewhere by management from time to time. Such factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and the reader should carefully consider them. Additional risk and uncertainties not presently known to us or which are currently not believed to be material may also affect our actual results. Because of these and other factors, past performance should not be considered an indication of future performance.\nOur Quarterly Operating Results Have Varied Significantly.\nOur operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and depend on a number of factors affecting us or our industry, including many that are beyond our control. As a result, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our operating results should not be relied on as an indication of our future performance. In addition, our operating results in a future quarter or quarters may fall below expectations of securities analysts or investors and, as a result, the price of our common stock may fluctuate.\nOur quarterly revenues and operating results depend on many factors, including whether the deployment is on-premises or cloud-based; the type of license; the size, quantity and timing of sales received for our products during each quarter; the delivery of the related software or hardware; and our expectations regarding collection. Because there is uncertainty around when our partners and current or potential customers will place orders and finalize license agreements, we may not be able to accurately forecast our licensing activity, our revenues and our operating results for future quarters. We have generally experienced a lengthy initial sales cycle for our on-premises and single-tenant offerings, which can last six to nine months and sometimes longer. The lengthy sales cycle is one of the factors that has caused, and may in the future continue to cause, our license and hardware revenues and operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter which may in turn affect the market price of our common stock. Because of the unique characteristics of our products and our prospective customers\u2019 internal evaluation processes, decisions to license our products often require significant time and executive-level decision making. As a result, sales cycles for customer orders vary substantially from customer to customer. The length of the sales cycle for customer orders depends on a number of other factors over which we have little or no control, including:\n\u2022\na customer\u2019s budgetary constraints;\n\u2022\nthe timing of a customer\u2019s budget cycle;\n\u2022\nconcerns by customers about the introduction of new product offerings by us or our competitors; and\n\u2022\ndownturns in general economic conditions, including reductions in demand for contact center services.\nOur limited number of product offerings, changes in pricing policies, the timing of development completion, announcement and sale of new or upgraded versions of our product offerings and the effect of cloud-based deployments on recognizing revenues are some of the additional factors that could cause our revenues and operating results to vary significantly from period to period.\nWe recognize revenues from different licenses over different periods depending on the satisfaction of the requirements of relevant accounting literature, including FASB ASC Topic 985, Software (\"FASB ASC 985\"), and FASB ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition (\"FASB ASC 605\").\nA large portion of our operating expenses, including salaries and rent, is fixed and difficult to reduce or modify in a short time period. As a result, our financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected if revenues do not meet our expectations.\nBecause We Recognize Recurring Revenue Over the Term of the Applicable Agreement, the Lack of Recurring Renewals or New Service Agreements May Not Be Reflected Immediately in our Operating Results. As Our Business Continues to Shift Toward a Greater Number of Cloud Subscriptions, This May Have a Greater Impact on Our Operating Results.\nAs we continue to shift toward a cloud offering model, it is increasingly difficult to demonstrate period-over-period revenue growth because revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable contract terms. As a result, a portion of our quarterly revenue is attributable to service agreements entered into during previous quarters. A decline in new or renewed service agreements or significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our services in any one quarter will not be fully reflected in our revenue and operating results in that quarter but will negatively impact our revenue and operating results in future quarters.\nOur Future Business Prospects Depend in Part on Our Ability to Maintain and Improve Our Current Product Offerings and Develop New Product Offerings.\nWe believe that our future business prospects depend in large part on our ability to maintain and improve our current product offerings and to develop new product offerings and services on a timely basis. Our products and services will have to continue to achieve market acceptance, maintain technological competitiveness and meet an expanding range of customer requirements. As a result of the complexities inherent in our products, major new products and product enhancements require\nlong development and testing periods. We may not be successful in developing and marketing, on a timely and cost effective basis, product enhancements or new products that respond to technological change, evolving industry standards or customer requirements. We may also experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction or marketing of product enhancements, and our new products and product enhancements may not achieve market acceptance. Significant delays in the general availability of new releases of our products and services or significant problems in the installation or implementation of new releases of our products could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur Cloud Offerings Present Execution and Competitive Risks.\nWe have devoted significant resources and continue to devote significant resources to the development of our PureCloud Platform, which is and will continue to be materially dependent upon AWS. There can be no assurance that AWS will continue to support and maintain its services. Also, AWS may cease to make its technology available to us for use with our PureCloud Platform, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and would require us to either develop replacement technology or find another third-party provider, neither of which may be possible in a timely or seamless manner.\nIn addition to certain software development costs, we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support our single-tenant cloud computing offering. These costs have negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact, our operating margins.\nCertain new competitors offer alternative cloud-based offerings for consumers and business customers. While we believe our expertise, investments in infrastructure and the breadth of our cloud-based offerings provide us with a solid foundation to compete, it is uncertain whether our strategies will attract the users or generate the revenue required to be successful. Whether we are successful in our business model depends on our execution in a number of areas, including:\n\u2022\ncontinuing to innovate and bring to market compelling cloud-based experiences that generate increasing sales;\n\u2022\nimproving the functionality and scalability of our cloud-based offerings; and\n\u2022\ncontinuing to enhance the attractiveness of our cloud-based platforms to partners.\nOur Products Could Have Defects for Which We Are Potentially Liable and Which Could Result in Loss of Revenue, Increased Costs, Loss of Our Credibility, Harm Our Reputation or Delay in Acceptance of Our Products in the Market.\nOur products, including services or components supplied by others, may contain errors or defects, especially when first introduced or when new versions are released. Despite internal product testing, we have in the past discovered software errors in some of our products after their introduction. Errors in new products or releases could be found after commencement of commercial shipments, and this could result in additional development costs, diversion of technical and other resources from our other development efforts or the loss of credibility with current or future customers. This could result in a loss of revenue or delay in market acceptance of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur license and subscription agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability and certain claims. However, not all of these agreements contain these types of provisions and, where present, these provisions vary as to their terms and may not be effective under the laws of some jurisdictions. A product liability, warranty or other claim brought against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nSome of our product offerings are developed to run on the Microsoft\u00ae Windows\u00ae operating system and use one or more media servers for voice (telephone call) processing and recording. Our server product offerings also operate in a network environment with database servers, email servers and third-party systems such as CRM products, Salesforce and AWS for our PureCloud Platform. As a cloud-based offering, our products can be deployed as a cloud offering via wide area networks. Because of this complexity, our product offerings may be more prone to performance interruptions for our customers than traditional hardware-based products. Performance interruptions at our customer sites, some of which currently do not have back-up systems, could affect demand for our product offerings or give rise to claims against us.\nThe Overall Economic Climate Could Result in Decreased Demand for Our Products and Services.\nCertain of our products require substantial capital commitments by customers and involve a potentially long sales cycle. As a result, our operations and performance depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions and their impact on customer\npurchasing decisions. Given the current economic conditions, current and potential customers are more cognizant of their budgets for communication offerings, services and systems, which may result in our current or prospective customers delaying and/or reducing their capital spending related to information systems. Some of the factors that could influence the levels of spending by our current or prospective customers include availability of credit, labor and healthcare costs, consumer confidence and other factors affecting spending behavior. These and other economic factors could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services and on our financial condition and operating results.\nIf Our Customers Do Not Perceive Our Product Offerings or the Related Services and Support Provided by Us or Our Partners to Be Effective or of High Quality, Our Brand and Name Recognition Will Suffer.\nWe believe that establishing and maintaining brand and name recognition is critical for attracting, retaining and expanding customers in our target markets. We also believe that the importance of reputation and name recognition will increase as competition in our market increases. Promotion and enhancement of our name will depend on the effectiveness of our marketing and advertising efforts and on our success in providing high-quality products and related services, including installation, training and maintenance, none of which can be assured. If our customers do not perceive our products or related services to be effective or of high quality, our brand and name recognition would suffer which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur Business Depends Substantially on Customers Renewing, Upgrading and Expanding Their Recurring Contracts for Our Product Offerings and Services. Any Decline in Our Customer Renewals, Upgrades and Expansions Would Harm Our Future Operating Results.\nWe sell maintenance contracts with our on-premises offering, which are typically one year in length. In addition, subscriptions for our single-tenant cloud offering have historically been three to five years in length, although since the beginning of 2015 the contracts have primarily been one year in length. Our PureCloud product subscriptions may be paid in arrears on a month-to-month basis or prepaid in advance for a term not to exceed twelve (12) months. Our customers have no obligation to renew their cloud subscriptions or on-premises maintenance contracts after their contract period expires, and there is the possibility that our customers may renew at lower levels of maintenance and/or services. In the first year of a subscription, customers often purchase a higher level of professional services than they do when they renew their subscription. As a result, our ability to grow our services revenues is dependent in part on customers purchasing additional services after the first year of their cloud subscriptions. We may not accurately predict future trends in customer renewals. Our customers\u2019 renewal rates may decline or fluctuate because of several factors, including their satisfaction or dissatisfaction with our services, the prices of our services, the prices of services offered by our competitors or reductions in our customers\u2019 spending levels due to the macroeconomic environment or other factors. If our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our services, renew on less favorable terms or do not purchase additional functionality or subscriptions, our revenue may grow more slowly than expected or decline and our profitability and gross margin may be harmed.\nWe Face Competitive Pressures, Which May Affect Us Adversely.\nThe market for our product offerings is highly competitive and, because there are relatively low barriers to entry in the software market, we expect competitive pressures to continue to be a risk to our ongoing success in the market. In addition, because our industry is evolving and characterized by rapid technological change, it is difficult for us to predict whether, when and by whom new competing technologies or new competitors may be introduced into our markets. Currently, our competition comes from several different markets, including computer telephony platform developers, computer telephony product software developers and telecommunications equipment vendors. Additionally, alternative deployment strategies, such as cloud-based services, are offered by other companies. We may not be able to compete effectively against current and future competitors in these markets, or in new markets with new types of competitors. In addition, increased competition or other competitive pressures may result in price reductions, reduced margins or loss of market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nSome of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater resources, greater name recognition and a larger installed base of customers than we do. Competitors may be able to respond to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements more effectively than we can, or devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of products than we can. In addition, for a number of our larger competitors, the product market in which they currently compete with us is a small portion of their overall offering. These competitors might be willing and able to dramatically cut prices in our market in order to protect or grow other markets that are more important to their overall business. Current and potential competitors have established, and may in the future establish, cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties, including mergers or acquisitions, to increase the ability of their products to address the\nneeds of our current or prospective customers. If these competitors were to acquire significantly increased market share, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur Multi-Tenant Cloud Offering Utilizes Open Source Software, and Any Failure to Comply With the Terms of One or More of These Open Source Licenses Could Negatively Affect Our Business.\nOur multi-tenant cloud offering includes software covered by open source licenses, which may include, for example, free general public use licenses, open source front-end libraries, open source stand-alone applications and open source applications. The terms of various open source licenses have not been interpreted by United States courts, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner than imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to market our multi-tenant cloud offering. By the terms of certain open source licenses, we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary software, and to make our proprietary software available under open source licenses, if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner. In the event that portions of our proprietary software are determined to be subject to an open source license, we could be required to publicly release the affected portions of our source code, re-engineer all or a portion of our technologies or otherwise be limited in the licensing of our technologies, each of which could reduce or eliminate the value of our technologies and multi-tenant cloud offering. In addition to risks related to license requirements, usage of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the origin of the software. Given the nature of open source software, there is also a risk that third parties may assert copyright and other intellectual property infringement claims against us based on our use of certain open source software programs. Many of the risks associated with the usage of open source software cannot be eliminated, and could harm our business.\nA Failure or Compromise of Our Information Security Measures Could Result in Substantial Harm to Our Reputation, Daily Operations or Profitability.\nWe utilize web-based systems and applications to process new sales and to provide support services to our customers and partners. Because these systems are Internet-facing, they are necessarily subject to a variety of cyber-attacks, which, if successful, could disrupt our ability to process new orders and our ability to provide support services effectively. Additionally, we house corporate intellectual property and varying amounts of sensitive customer information on our private network.\nWe have implemented technical and administrative controls designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of these systems and the data they house. We have also implemented commercially available products and system tools designed to monitor, detect and/or prevent cyber-attacks and other malicious activity that may occur on our systems. Additionally, we have developed and implemented processes to respond to and mitigate identified issues quickly and effectively.\nIf these security measures fail, are compromised or we fail to detect and mitigate any such compromise promptly, it could result in the loss of intellectual property, the breach of sensitive customer information entrusted to our care, damage to our reputation, disruption of routine operations and/or significant financial expense related to the mitigation or response to, or litigation resulting from, any particular issue.\nWe have not experienced any events, either individually or in aggregate, of a material nature or that resulted in any material financial impact or any material loss or exposure of sensitive data.\nIndustry-specific and Internet Regulation is Evolving and Unfavorable Industry-specific Laws or New Regulation of the Internet by Governmental Agencies Could Harm Our Business.\nOur customers and potential customers do business in a variety of industries. Regulators in certain industries have adopted, and may in the future adopt, regulations regarding, among other things, the use of cloud computing and other outsourced services. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, industry-specific laws and regulations may limit customers\u2019 use and adoption of our services and reduce overall demand for our services. For instance, an inability to satisfy certain voluntary third-party certification standards that our customers may expect, such as an attestation of compliance with the Payment Card Industry (\"PCI\") Data Security Standards, may have an adverse effect on our business. If, in the future, we are unable to achieve or maintain these industry-specific certifications or other requirements or standards relevant to our customers, it may adversely affect our sales and/or reputation. In some cases, industry-specific laws or regulations may also apply directly to us as a service provider. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with such requirements could have an adverse effect on our business.\nRegulations related to the Internet could also affect our ability to provide our services. Congress has adopted legislation that regulates certain aspects of the Internet including online content, user privacy, taxation and liability for third-party\nactivities. This legislation, as well as other pending legislation, may have the effect of raising the cost of doing business on the Internet. Federal, state, local and foreign governmental organizations are considering other legislative and regulatory proposals that would regulate and/or tax applications running over the Internet. We cannot predict whether new taxes will be imposed on our services, and depending on the type of taxes imposed, whether and how our services would be affected thereafter. Increased regulation of the Internet may decrease its growth and hinder technological development, which may negatively impact the cost of doing business via the Internet or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMalicious Human Actions, Catastrophic Events or Disruption of Service at Our Data Centers May Disrupt Our Operations, Affect Our Operating Results and/or Delay Our Ability to Deliver Our Service to Our Customers.\nWe utilize third-party hosting facilities to provide services and support to our single-tenant cloud customers from a variety of data centers around the world. We do not have sole control over the operations of these facilities. These facilities, along with our systems and operations, are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, telecommunications failures and similar events. The occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems could result in lengthy interruptions in our services, causing delays in completing sales, providing services or performing other mission-critical functions. The facilities also could be subject to break-ins, cyber-attacks, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and other misconduct and malicious activity.\nThe continued threat of terrorism and heightened security and military action in response to this threat, or any future acts of terrorism, may also cause further disruptions to the economies of the United States and other countries and create further uncertainties or otherwise materially harm our business, operating results and financial condition. Likewise, events such as widespread blackouts could have similar negative impacts. To the extent that such disruptions or uncertainties result in delays or cancellations of customer orders or the manufacture or shipment of our product, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nDestruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information technology systems or a significant interruption, disruption or other performance problem with our service may harm our ability to conduct normal business operations and our operating results. This could reduce our revenue, cause us to issue credits or pay penalties, cause customers to terminate service and adversely affect our renewal rates and our ability to attract new customers.\nOur Inability to Successfully Manage Our Complex Supplier and Other Third-Party Relationships Could Adversely Affect Us.\nWe have complex supplier and other third-party relationships, and the management of those relationships and the negotiation of contractual terms sufficient to protect our rights and limit our potential liabilities are complicated. We license technology from third parties that is embedded in some of our products, making aspects of our business reliant upon those third parties. Some of these third parties that license technology to us are our competitors, or could become competitive with us in the future. Certain license agreements permit either party to terminate all or a portion of the license without cause at any time. Further, some of the license agreements provide that upon acquisition of us by certain other third parties, we would have to pay a significant fee to continue the license. As a result, our inability to successfully manage these relationships or negotiate sufficient contractual terms could have a material adverse effect on us.\nFor certain of our sales, we supply hardware to support the implementation of our product offerings. We are dependent upon third parties for the supply of hardware components to our customers. If these hardware distributors experience financial, operational or quality assurance difficulties, or if there is any other disruption in our relationships, we may be required to locate alternative hardware sources. We are also subject to the following risks related to our hardware distribution system:\n\u2022\ncancellations of orders or delays in delivering orders due to unavailability of hardware;\n\u2022\nincreased hardware prices, which may reduce our gross profit or make our products less price competitive;\n\u2022\nadditional development expense to modify our products to work with new hardware configurations; and\n\u2022\nperformance issues resulting from product changes by our hardware suppliers.\nWe cannot guarantee that we would be able to develop or locate alternative technology (including in situations where licensors cease to support and maintain what we license), or locate alternative hardware sources in a timely manner, on terms favorable to us, or at all. Even if we and/or our hardware distributors are successful in locating alternative sources of supply, alternative suppliers could increase prices significantly. In addition, alternative technology or hardware components may\nmalfunction or have interoperability issues that do not currently exist. The use of new suppliers and/or technology and the modification of our products to function with new technology and/or systems would require testing and may require further modifications which may result in additional expense, diversion of management attention and other resources, inability to fulfill customer sales or delay in fulfillment, reduction in quality and reliability, customer dissatisfaction and other adverse effects on our reputation, business and operating results.\nExisting and New Reseller Partners Are Important to Continued Growth.\nOur ability to achieve revenue growth in the future will depend in part on our success in maintaining productive relationships with our existing and future reseller partners and in recruiting and training additional reseller partners. We rely on these partners to market and support our product offerings and plan on continuing to rely on such partners in the future. We continue to expand our partner networks and may be unable to attract additional partners with both voice and data expertise or appropriate partners that will be able to market our products effectively and that will be qualified to provide timely and cost-effective customer support and service. We generally do not have long-term or exclusive agreements with our partners, and the loss of specific larger partners or a significant number of partners could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, due to the current economic conditions, the risk of failure of a specific partner or a significant number of partners is increased, which failure could also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf We Are Unable to Maintain the Compatibility of Our Software With Certain Other Products and Technologies, Our Future Business Would be Adversely Affected.\nOur product offerings must integrate with software and hardware products provided by a number of our existing and potential competitors. For example, our products must integrate with phone switches made by the telephone switch vendors and computer telephony software products offered by other software providers. These competitors or their business partners could alter their products so that our offerings no longer integrate well with them, or they could delay or deny our access to software releases that allow us to timely adapt our offerings to integrate with their products. If we cannot adapt our product offerings to changes in necessary technology, it may significantly impair our ability to compete effectively, particularly if our offerings must integrate with the software and hardware offerings of our competitors.\nOur Product Offerings Require Wide Area Networks and Internet, and We May be Unable to Sell Our Offerings Where Networks Do Not Perform Adequately.\nOur product offerings also depend on the reliable performance of the wide area networks of businesses and organizations, including those that employ remote and mobile workers. If enterprise customers experience inadequate performance with their wide area networks, whether due to outages, component failures or otherwise, our product performance would be adversely affected. As a result, when these types of problems occur with these networks, our enterprise customers may not be able to immediately identify the source of the problem, and may conclude that the problem is related to our offerings. This could harm our relationships with our current enterprise customers and make it more difficult to attract new enterprise customers, which could negatively affect our business.\nWe May Not Be Able to Protect Our Proprietary Rights Adequately, Which Could Allow Third Parties to Copy or Otherwise Obtain and Use Our Technology Without Authorization.\nWe regard our product offerings as proprietary. In an effort to protect our proprietary rights, we rely primarily on a combination of copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as patents, licensing and other agreements with consultants, suppliers, partners and customers and employee and third-party non-disclosure agreements. These laws and agreements provide only limited protection of our proprietary rights. It may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our technology without authorization. A third party could also develop similar technology independently. In addition, the laws of some countries in which we license our products do not protect our product and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Unauthorized copying, use or reverse engineering of our offerings could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nSpecific, Negotiated Provisions in Agreements May Expose Us to Liability That Is Not Limited in Amount By the Terms of the Contract.\nCertain contract provisions, principally confidentiality, security and indemnification obligations in certain of our license and subscription agreements, could expose us to risks of loss that, in some cases, are not limited by contract to a specified maximum amount but are generally limited by various pre-conditions to coverage. We could be subject to additional liability\nand our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if those seeking to enforce these contract provisions are successful in their assertions.\nInfringement Claims Could Adversely Affect Us.\nThird parties have claimed and may in the future claim that our technology infringes their proprietary rights. As the number of products in our target markets increases and the functionality of these products overlap, we believe that software developers may face additional infringement claims.\nInfringement claims, even if without merit, can be time consuming and expensive to defend. A third party asserting infringement claims against us or our customers with respect to our current or future offerings may require us to enter into costly royalty arrangements or litigation, or otherwise materially adversely affect us.\nWe Depend on Key Personnel and Must Retain and Recruit Skilled Personnel, for Which Competition Is Intense.\nOur success depends in large part on the continued service of our key personnel, particularly Dr. Donald E. Brown, our Chief Executive Officer and largest shareholder. The loss of the services of Dr. Brown or other key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our future success also depends on our ability to attract, train, assimilate and retain additional qualified personnel. Competition for persons with skills in the software industry is intense, particularly for those with relevant technical and/or sales experience. We may not be able to retain our key employees or may not be able to attract, train, assimilate or retain other highly qualified personnel in the future.\nOur International Operations Involve Financial and Operational Risks Which May Adversely Affect Our Business and Operating Results.\nOur international operations require significant management attention and financial resources to establish and operate, including hiring appropriate personnel and recruiting effective international partners. Non-North American revenues accounted for 28%, 29% and 26% of our total revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We intend to continue to emphasize our international operations and we may enter additional international markets. Revenues from international operations may be inadequate to cover the expenses of those operations. Risks inherent in our international business activities may include the following:\n\u2022\neconomic and political instability;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in foreign regulatory requirements and laws;\n\u2022\ntariffs and other trade barriers;\n\u2022\ntiming, cost and potential difficulty of adapting our products to the local language in those foreign countries that do not use the English alphabet, such as Japan, Korea and China;\n\u2022\nlack of acceptance of our product offerings in foreign countries;\n\u2022\nlonger sales cycles and accounts receivable payment cycles;\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the repatriation of funds;\n\u2022\nacts of terrorism; and\n\u2022\nincreased government regulations related to increasing or reducing business activity in various countries.\nFluctuations in exchange rates between the United States dollar and other currencies have had, and in the future could have, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, and particularly, on our operating margins and net income. We maintain a currency hedging program to help mitigate future effects of fluctuations in the foreign exchange rates on cash and receivables. These hedging techniques may not be successful. Exchange rate fluctuations could also make our offerings more expensive than competitive offerings not subject to these fluctuations, which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability in international markets.\nWe Have Made Acquisitions and May Pursue Acquisitions That Present Risks and May Not be Successful.\nWe have acquired companies and in the future we may pursue acquisitions to diversify our product offerings and customer base, to strengthen our distribution channel or for other strategic purposes. Our recent or future acquisitions may not be\nsuccessful. The following are some of the risks associated with our acquisitions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations:\n\u2022\nour acquired businesses may not achieve anticipated revenues, earnings or cash flow.\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully and realize anticipated economic, operational and other benefits in a timely manner, particularly if we acquire a business in a market in which we have limited or no current expertise, or with a corporate culture different from our own. If we are unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully, we could incur substantial costs and delays or other operational, technical or financial problems.\n\u2022\nacquisitions could disrupt our ongoing business, distract management, divert resources and make it difficult to maintain our current business standards, controls and procedures.\n\u2022\nwe may be competing with other firms, many of which have greater financial and other resources, to acquire attractive companies, making it more difficult to acquire suitable companies on acceptable terms.\n\u2022\nwe may not have sufficient cash on hand to fund future acquisitions, and even if additional debt or equity financing is available, it may not be on terms that are favorable to us or sufficient for our needs. In addition, if we finance future acquisitions by issuing common stock for some or all of the purchase price, this could dilute the ownership interest of our shareholders. We may also be required to recognize expense related to intangible assets recorded in future acquisitions.\nChanges in Corporate Taxes or Adverse Outcomes Resulting from Examination of Our Income Tax Returns Could Adversely Affect Our Results.\nOur provision for income taxes has been and may continue to be affected by the following:\n\u2022\nchanges in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;\n\u2022\nearnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates;\n\u2022\ntransfer pricing adjustments including the post-acquisition integration of purchased intangible assets from certain acquisitions into our intercompany research and development cost sharing arrangement;\n\u2022\ntax effects of nondeductible stock option expense;\n\u2022\ntax costs related to intercompany realignments;\n\u2022\nforeign losses not being utilized to offset future taxable income; or\n\u2022\nchanges in tax laws, regulations and accounting principles, including accounting for uncertain tax positions or interpretations thereof.\nSignificant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nIf amounts included in tax returns are increased, reduced or disallowed, it would affect our loss carryforwards and tax credits and the amount of expected future non-cash income tax expense used by management and investors. Judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attributes prescribed in FASB ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes (\u201cFASB ASC 740\u201d). In addition, FASB ASC 740 applies to all income tax positions, including the potential recovery of previously paid taxes, which if settled unfavorably could adversely impact our provision for income taxes or additional paid-in capital. Further, as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments, our income in certain tax jurisdictions is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from tax. Our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes. We have also recorded state and local income tax incentives as a reduction of certain operating expenses and if those incentives were to be disallowed we may be required to record additional expense. In addition, we are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. The outcomes from these continuous examinations may have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nAs a Holding Company, Interactive Intelligence Depends in Large Part on Dividends from Its Operating Subsidiaries to Satisfy Its Obligations.\nInteractive Intelligence is a holding company with no business operations of its own. Its only significant assets are the outstanding shares of capital stock of its subsidiaries. As a result, it relies on funds from its current subsidiaries and any subsidiaries that it may form in the future to meet its obligations.\nWe Incurred Indebtedness By Issuing Convertible Senior Notes, and Our Debt Repayment, Conversion and Repurchase Obligations May Adversely Affect Our Financial Condition and Cash Flows From Operations in the Future.\nIn May 2015, we issued $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of 1.25% convertible senior notes (the \"Notes\") due June 1, 2020, unless earlier purchased or converted. Interest is payable semi-annually, in arrears, on June 1 and December 1 of each year, and we made our first interest payment on December 1, 2015. Our indebtedness may impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes. A portion of our cash flows from operations may have to be dedicated towards repaying the principal beginning in 2020 or earlier if necessary, or in the event the conditional conversion feature of the Notes is triggered, one or more holders elect to convert their Notes and we settle all or a portion of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash. In addition, if the conditional conversion feature is triggered, even if holders do not elect to convert their Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nIn addition, holders of the Notes have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change, including, among other things, a change in control, at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. We may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to repurchase Notes surrendered therefor.\nOur ability to meet our debt obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors. We cannot control many of these factors. Our future operations may not generate sufficient cash to enable us to repay our debt. If we fail to make a payment on our debt, we could be in default on such debt. If we are at any time unable to pay our indebtedness when due, we may be required to renegotiate the terms of the indebtedness, seek to refinance all or a portion of the indebtedness or obtain additional financing. In the future, we may not be able to successfully renegotiate such terms, any such refinancing may not be possible and any additional financing may not be on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us.\nWe Are Exposed to Fluctuations in the Market Value of Our Money Market Funds and Investments. The Financial Pressure on Investment Institutions Managing Our Investments or the Failure of Such Entities May Lead to Restrictions on Access to Our Investments Which Could Negatively Impact Our Balance of Cash and Cash Equivalents, thus Affecting Our Overall Financial Condition.\nWe maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings and maturities of up to three years. These securities are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value. This portfolio includes money market funds, U.S. treasuries, asset-backed securities, notes, bonds and commercial paper of various issuers. If the debt of these issuers is downgraded, the carrying value of these investments could be impaired. In addition, we could also face default risk from some of these issuers, which could cause the carrying value to be impaired. Financial institutions have been under significant pressure over the past several years. Should one or more of the financial institutions managing our invested funds experience increased financial pressure resulting in bankruptcy, or the threat of bankruptcy, access to our funds may be restricted for a period of time and may also result in losses on those funds.\nOur cash and cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase. We maintain the cash and cash equivalents with reputable major financial institutions. Deposits with these banks exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limits or similar limits in foreign jurisdictions. While we monitor daily the cash balances in the operating accounts and adjust the balances as appropriate, these balances could be impacted if one or more of the financial institutions with which we deposit fails or is subject to other adverse conditions in the financial or credit markets. To date we have experienced no loss or lack of access to our invested cash or cash equivalents; however, access to our invested cash and cash equivalents may be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial and credit markets.\nOur Stock Price Has Been and Could Continue to Be Highly Volatile.\nOur stock price has been and could continue to be highly volatile due to a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us, our competitors or our customers;\n\u2022\ntechnological innovations by us and others;\n\u2022\nthe operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies or of our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe availability for future sale, or sales, of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market; and\n\u2022\ngeneral market or economic conditions.\nThis risk may be heightened because our industry is continually evolving, characterized by rapid technological change, and is susceptible to the introduction of new competing technologies or competitors.\nIn addition, the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations in the recent past that have particularly affected the trading prices of equity securities of many technology companies, including us. These price and volume fluctuations often have been unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has sometimes been instituted against that company. This type of litigation, regardless of the outcome, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf Securities or Industry Analysts Do Not Publish Research or Reports About Our Business, or Publish Negative Reports About Our Business, Our Share Price and Trading Volume Could Decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business, our market and our competitors. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our shares or change their opinion of our shares, our share price would likely decline. If one of more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our share price or trading volume to decline.\nChanges Made to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and Other Legislative Changes May Impact Our Business.\nRevisions to generally accepted accounting principles will require us to review our accounting and financial reporting procedures in order to ensure continued compliance with required policies. From time to time, such changes may have a short-term impact on our reporting, and these changes may impact market perception of our financial condition. In addition, legislative changes, and the perception these changes create, can have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFailure to Maintain Effective Internal Controls in Accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on Our Business, Operating Results and Stock Price.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\"Sarbanes-Oxley Act\") imposes certain duties on us and our executives and directors. We are also required to comply with the internal control over financial reporting requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Our efforts to comply with the requirements of Section 404 have resulted in increased general and administrative expense and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities, and we expect these efforts to require the continued commitment of significant resources.\nIf we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, we may not be able to conclude that we have effective internal control over financial reporting. If we have a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, we may not detect errors on a timely basis and our financial statements may be materially misstated. If we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, if we are unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to attest that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock could decrease. We could also become subject to shareholder or other third-party litigation as well as investigations by the stock exchange on\nwhich our securities are listed, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources and could result in fines, trading suspensions or other remedies.\nAnti-Takeover Provisions in Our Organizational Documents and Indiana Law Make Any Change in Control of Us More Difficult, May Discourage Bids at a Premium over the Market Price and May Adversely Affect the Market Price of Our Stock.\nOur Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws contain provisions that may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of us, may discourage bids at a premium over the market price of our common stock and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nthe division of our board of directors into three classes serving staggered three-year terms;\n\u2022\nremoval of directors only for cause and only upon a 66 2/3% shareholder vote;\n\u2022\nprohibiting shareholders from calling a special meeting of shareholders;\n\u2022\nthe ability to issue additional shares of our common stock or preferred stock without shareholders\u2019 approval; and\n\u2022\nadvance notice requirements for raising business or making nominations at shareholders\u2019 meetings.\nThe Indiana Business Corporation Law (\"IBCL\") contains business combination provisions that, in general, prohibit for five years any business combination with a beneficial owner of 10% or more of our common stock unless the holder\u2019s acquisition of the stock was approved in advance by our board of directors. The IBCL also contains control share acquisition provisions that limit the ability of certain shareholders to vote their shares unless their control share acquisition is approved. We have not opted out of the business combination or control share acquisition provisions.\nThe Accounting Method for Convertible Debt Securities That May Be Settled in Cash, Such As the Notes, Could Have a Material Effect on Our Reported Financial Results.\nFASB ASC Subtopic 470-20 (\"FASB ASC 470-20\"), Debt with Conversion and Other Options, requires an entity to separately account for the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments (such as the Notes) that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer\u2019s non-convertible debt interest rate. Accordingly, the equity component of the Notes is required to be included in the additional paid-in capital section of shareholders\u2019 equity on our consolidated balance sheet at the issuance date, and the value of the equity component is treated as original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the Notes. As a result, we will be required to recognize a greater amount of non-cash interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations in the current and future periods presented as a result of the amortization of the discounted carrying value of the Notes to their principal amount over the term of the Notes. We will report lower net income (or greater net losses) in our consolidated financial results because FASB ASC 470-20 will require interest to include both the current period\u2019s amortization of the original issue discount and the instrument\u2019s convertible cash coupon. This could adversely affect our future consolidated financial results, the trading price of our common stock and the trading price of the Notes.\nIn addition, under certain circumstances, in calculating earnings per share, convertible debt instruments (such as the Notes) that may be settled entirely or partly in cash are currently accounted for utilizing the treasury stock method, the effect of which is that the shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes, if any, are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share except to the extent that the conversion value of the Notes exceeds their principal amount. Under the treasury stock method, diluted earnings per share is calculated as if the number of shares of common stock that would be necessary to settle such excess, if we elected to settle such excess in shares, were issued. We cannot be sure that the accounting standards in the future will continue to permit the use of the treasury stock method. If we are unable to use the treasury stock method in accounting for the shares issuable upon conversion of the Notes, if any, then our diluted consolidated earnings per share would be adversely affected.\nThe Capped Call Transactions May Affect the Value of the Notes and Our Common Stock.\nIn connection with the pricing of the Notes, we entered into capped call transactions with the option counterparties. The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock upon any conversion of Notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted Notes, as the case may be, upon any conversion of any Notes, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap. In connection with establishing their initial hedge of the capped call transactions, the option counterparties and/or their respective affiliates entered\ninto various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock. This activity or any reduction in such continued activity could affect the market price of our common stock or the Notes.\nIn addition, the option counterparties and/or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the Notes. This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock or the Notes, which could affect our ability to convert the Notes and, to the extent the activity occurs during any observation period related to a conversion of Notes, it could affect the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the Notes. We cannot predict what effect the capped call transactions could have on the price of our common stock.\nConversion of the Notes May Dilute the Ownership Interest of Existing Shareholders, Including Holders Who Had Previously Converted Their Notes, or May Otherwise Depress the Price of Our Common Stock.\nThe conversion of the Notes into shares of our common stock, to the extent that we choose not to deliver all cash for the conversion value, will dilute the ownership interests of existing shareholders. Any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the Notes may encourage short selling by market participants due to this dilution or may facilitate trading strategies involving the Notes and our common stock.", "PERMNO": 87264, "SIC": 7372, "TIC": "ININ"}
