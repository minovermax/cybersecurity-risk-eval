RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information contained in this Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business. Our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business and operations.\nOur industry is highly cyclical, and prolonged periods of weak demand or excess supply may reduce our net sales and/or margins, which may cause us to incur losses or reduce our net income.\nThe building products distribution industry is subject to cyclical market pressures. Prices of building products are determined by overall supply and demand in the market. Market prices of building products historically have been volatile and cyclical, and we have limited ability to control the timing and amount of pricing changes. Demand for building products is driven mainly by factors outside of our control, such as general economic and political conditions, interest rates, availability of\nmortgage financing, the construction, repair and remodeling markets, industrial markets, weather, and population growth. The supply of building products fluctuates based on available manufacturing capacity, and excess capacity in the industry can result in significant declines in market prices for those products. To the extent that prices and volumes experience a sustained or sharp decline, our net sales and margins likely would decline as well. Because we have substantial fixed costs, a decrease in sales and margin generally may have a significant adverse impact on our financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.\nCertain of our products are commodities and fluctuations in prices of these commodities could affect our operating results.\nMany of the building products which we distribute, including OSB, plywood, lumber, and rebar, are commodities that are widely available from other distributors or manufacturers, with prices and volumes determined frequently in an auction market based on participants\u2019 perceptions of short-term supply and demand factors. Prices of commodity products can also change as a result of national and international economic conditions, labor and freight costs, competition, market speculation, government regulation and trade policies, as well as from periodic delays in the delivery of products. Short-term increases in the cost of these materials, some of which are subject to significant fluctuations, are sometimes passed on to our customers, but our pricing quotation periods and pricing pressure from our competitors may limit our ability to pass on such price changes. We may also be limited in our ability to pass on increases in freight costs on our products.\nAt times, the purchase price for any one or more of the products we produce or distribute may fall below our purchase costs, requiring us to incur short-term losses on product sales. Therefore, our profitability with respect to these commodity products depends, in significant part, on managing our cost structure. Commodity product prices could be volatile in response to operating rates and inventory levels in various distribution channels. Commodity price volatility affects our distribution business, with falling price environments generally causing reduced revenues and margins, resulting in substantial declines in profitability and possible net losses.\nThe wood products industry supply is influenced primarily by price-induced changes in the operating rates of existing facilities, but is also influenced over time by the introduction of new product technologies, capacity additions and closures, restart of idled capacity, and log availability. The balance of wood products supply and demand in the United States is also heavily influenced by imported products.\nWe have very limited control of the foregoing, and as a result, our profitability and cash flow may fluctuate materially in response to changes in the supply and demand balance for our primary products.\nOur cash flows and capital resources may be insufficient to make required payments on our substantial indebtedness, future indebtedness, or to maintain our required level of excess liquidity.\nWe have a substantial amount of debt which could have important consequences for us. For example, our substantial indebtedness could:\n\u2022\nmake it difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations;\n\u2022\nmake us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and other general corporate requirements;\n\u2022\nexpose us to interest rate fluctuations because the interest rate on the debt under our new revolving credit facility (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) is variable;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows to payments on our debt, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flows for operations and other purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, and the industry in which we operate; and\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that may have proportionately less debt, and therefore may be in a better position to obtain favorable credit terms.\nIn addition, our ability to make scheduled payments or refinance our obligations depends on our successful financial and operating performance, cash flows, and capital resources, which in turn depend upon prevailing economic conditions and certain financial, business, and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include, among others:\n\u2022\neconomic and demand factors affecting the building products distribution industry;\n\u2022\nexternal factors affecting availability of credit;\n\u2022\npricing pressures;\n\u2022\nincreased operating costs;\n\u2022\ncompetitive conditions; and\n\u2022\nother operating difficulties.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell material assets or operations, obtain additional capital, or restructure our debt. There is no assurance that we could obtain additional capital or refinance our debt on terms acceptable to us, or at all. In the event that we are required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations, the value realized on the disposition of such assets or operations will depend on market conditions and the availability of buyers. Accordingly, any such sale may not, among other things, be for a sufficient dollar amount to repay our indebtedness. We may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. Our incurring additional indebtedness would intensify the risks described above.\nOur credit facility restricts our ability to dispose of assets.\nOur obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by a first priority security interest in all of our operating subsidiaries\u2019 assets, including inventories, accounts receivable, real property in excess of $10.0 million, and proceeds from those items. As of December 30, 2017, we had outstanding borrowings of $182.7 million and excess availability of $63.3 million, based on qualifying inventory and accounts receivable, under the terms of our Credit Agreement.\nIn the event of our breach of our new revolving credit facility, we may be required to repay any outstanding amounts earlier than anticipated, and the lenders may foreclose on their security interest in our assets or otherwise exercise their remedies with respect to such interests, in which case, we may not be able to dispose of assets on terms that are favorable to us. We may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, and our incurring additional indebtedness would intensify these risks.\nThe instruments governing our indebtedness contain various covenants limiting the discretion of our management in operating our business, including requiring us to maintain a minimum level of excess liquidity.\nOur new revolving credit facility contains various restrictive covenants and restrictions, including financial covenants customary for asset-based loans that limit management\u2019s discretion in operating our business. In particular, these instruments limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur additional debt;\n\u2022\ngrant liens on assets;\n\u2022\nmake investments;\n\u2022\nsell or acquire assets outside the ordinary course of business;\n\u2022\nengage in transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022\nmake fundamental business changes.\nThe Credit Agreement provides for a senior secured revolving loan and letter of credit facility of up to $335.0 million and an uncommitted accordion feature that permits us to increase the facility by an aggregate additional principal amount of up to $75.0 million, subject to certain conditions, including lender consent. The maturity date of the Credit Agreement is October 10, 2022.\nBorrowings under the Credit Agreement will be subject to availability under the Borrowing Base (as defined in the Credit Agreement). We will be required to repay revolving loans thereunder to the extent that such revolving loans exceed the borrowing base then in effect. Furthermore, in the event excess availability falls below the greater of (i) $35.0 million and (ii) 10% of the lesser of (a) the Borrowing Base and (b) the maximum permitted credit at such time, the Credit Agreement requires maintenance of a fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.1 to 1.0 (which, subject to satisfying certain conditions though the first fiscal quarter of 2018, may be reduced to 1.0 to 1.0) until such time as our excess availability has been at least $42.5 million for a period of 60 days.\nIf we fail to comply with the restrictions in the Credit Agreement or any other current or future financing agreements, a default may allow the creditors under the relevant instruments to accelerate the related debts and to exercise their remedies under these agreements, which typically will include the right to declare the principal amount of that debt, together with accrued and unpaid interest, and other related amounts, immediately due and payable, to exercise any remedies the creditors may have to foreclose on assets that are subject to liens securing that debt, and to terminate any commitments they had made to supply further funds.\nWe may not be able to monetize real estate assets if we experience adverse market conditions.\nWe sold substantial amounts of our real estate assets during fiscal 2016, 2017, and January 2018, and we have designated certain non-operating properties as held for sale, which we currently are actively marketing. In addition, we believe there will be future opportunities to monetize our real estate portfolio\u2019s equity value for debt reduction and investment purposes via sale leaseback and other strategic real estate transactions. However, real estate investments are relatively illiquid. We may not be able to sell the properties we have targeted for disposition or that we may decide to monetize in the future, due to adverse market conditions. This may negatively affect, among other things, our ability to sell properties on favorable terms and execute\nour strategic initiatives.\nInstruments governing our indebtedness limit transfers of our common stock.\nOur Credit Agreement contains limitations on transfers of our common stock under various conditions described in the terms of the Credit Agreement. As of December 30, 2017, we had outstanding borrowings of $182.7 million under the Credit Agreement. If at any time any person or group of persons acquires 35% or more of our common stock, whether or not inadvertently, then a change of control would be triggered under our Credit Agreement that would result in an event of default under the facility. In the event of any breach of the Credit Agreement as a result of such transfers, we may be required to repay any outstanding amounts earlier than anticipated, and the lenders may foreclose on their security interests in our assets or otherwise exercise their remedies with respect to such interests.\nAdverse housing market conditions may negatively impact our business, liquidity and results of operations, as well as increase the credit risk from our customers.\nOur business depends to a significant degree on the new residential construction market and, in particular, single family home construction. The homebuilding industry underwent a significant decline from its peak in 2005. Although the homebuilding industry has improved over the last few years, it is still far below its historical averages. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, actual single family housing starts in the United States during 2017 increased 8.5% from 2016 levels, but remain 50.6% below their peak in 2005. The multi-year downturn in the homebuilding industry resulted in a substantial reduction in demand for the products we provide. We cannot predict the duration of the current housing industry market conditions or the timing or strength of any continued recovery of housing activity in our markets. The homebuilding industry also may not recover to historical levels. Continued weakness in the new residential construction market would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. Factors impacting the level of activity in the residential new construction markets include changes in interest rates, unemployment rates, high foreclosure rates and unsold/foreclosure inventory, availability of financing, labor costs, vacancy rates, local, state and federal government regulation, and shifts in populations away from the markets that we serve. In addition, the mortgage markets periodically experience disruption and reduced availability of mortgages for potential homebuyers due to more restrictive standards to qualify for mortgages, including with respect to new home construction loans. Because of these factors, there may be fluctuations in our operating results, and the results for any historical period may not be indicative of results for any future period.\nWe also rely on residential repair and remodel activity levels. Historically, residential repair and remodeling activity has decreased in slow economic periods. General economic weakness, elevated unemployment levels, mortgage delinquency and foreclosure rates, limitations in the availability of mortgage and home improvement financing, and lower housing turnover all limit consumers\u2019 spending, particularly on discretionary items, and affect their confidence level leading to reduced spending on home improvement projects. Depressed activity levels in consumer spending for home improvement construction would adversely affect our business, liquidity, results of operations, and financial position. Furthermore, economic weakness causes unanticipated shifts in consumer preferences and purchasing practices, and in the business models and strategies of our customers. Such shifts may alter the nature and prices of products demanded by the end consumer, and, in turn, our customers and could adversely affect our operating performance.\nIn addition, we extend credit to numerous customers who are generally susceptible to the same economic business risks as we are. Unfavorable housing market conditions could result in financial failures of one or more of our significant customers. Furthermore, we may not necessarily be aware of any deterioration in our customers\u2019 financial position. If our larger customers\u2019 financial positions were to become impaired, our ability to fully collect receivables from such customers could be impaired and negatively affect our operating results, cash flow and liquidity.\nWe are exposed to product liability and other claims and legal proceedings related to our business and the products we distribute, which may exceed the coverage of our insurance.\nThe building products industry has been subject to personal injury and property damage claims arising from alleged exposure to raw materials contained in building products as well as claims for incidents of catastrophic loss, such as building fires. As a distributor of building materials, we face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of the products we have distributed in the past or may in the future distribute is alleged to have resulted in economic loss, personal injury or property damage, or violated environmental, health or safety, or other laws. Such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product, negligence, strict liability, or a breach of warranties. We are also from time to time subject to casualty, contract, tort, and other claims relating to our business, the products we have distributed in the past or may in the future distribute and the services we have provided in the past or may in the future provide, either directly or through third parties. We rely on manufacturers and other suppliers to provide us with the products we sell or distribute. Since we do not have direct control over the quality of products that are manufactured or supplied to us by third parties, we are particularly vulnerable to risks relating to the quality of such products.\nWe cannot predict or, in some cases, control the costs to defend or resolve such claims. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain suitable and adequate insurance on acceptable terms or that such insurance will provide adequate protection against potential liabilities, and the cost of any product liability or other proceeding, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial. Additionally, we do not carry insurance for all categories of risk that our business may encounter. Any significant uninsured liability may require us to pay substantial amounts. There can be no assurance that any current or future claims will not adversely affect our financial position, cash flows, or results of operations.\nProduct shortages, loss of key suppliers, our dependence on third-party suppliers and manufacturers, and new tariffs could affect our financial health.\nOur ability to offer a wide variety of products to our customers is dependent upon our ability to obtain adequate product supply from domestic and international manufacturers and other suppliers. Generally, our products are obtainable from various sources and in sufficient quantities. However, the loss of, or a substantial decrease in the availability of, products from our suppliers or the loss of key supplier arrangements could adversely impact our financial condition, operating results, and cash flows. In addition, many of our suppliers are located outside of the United States. Thus, trade restrictions, including new or increased tariffs, quotas, embargoes, sanctions, safeguards and customs restrictions, as well as foreign labor strikes, work stoppages or boycotts, could increase the cost or reduce the supply of the products available to us.\nAlthough in many instances we have agreements with our suppliers, these agreements are generally terminable by either party on limited notice. Failure by our suppliers to continue to supply us with products on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.\nA change in our product mix could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur results may be affected by a change in our product mix. Our outlook, budgeting, and strategic planning assume a certain product mix of sales. If actual results vary from this projected product mix of sales, our financial results could be negatively impacted. Additionally, gross margins vary across our product lines. If the mix of products shifts from higher margin product categories to lower margin product categories, our overall gross margins and profitability may be adversely affected. Consequently, changes in our product mix could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results.\nRelatedly, our product sales to a customer may be dependent on the supplier and the brands we distribute. If we are unable to supply certain brands to our customers, then our ability to sell to existing customers and acquire new customers will be difficult to accomplish. As a result, our revenue, operating performance, cash flows, and net income may be adversely affected.\nWe may be unable to effectively manage our inventory as our sales volume increases or the prices of the products we distribute fluctuate, which could affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe purchase many of our products directly from manufacturers, which are then sold and distributed to customers. We must maintain, and have adequate working capital to purchase, sufficient inventory to meet customer demand. Due to the lead times required by our suppliers, we order products in advance of expected sales. As a result, we are required to forecast our sales and purchase accordingly. In periods characterized by significant changes in the overall economy and activity in the residential and commercial building and home repair and remodel industries, it can be especially difficult to forecast our sales accurately. We must also manage our working capital to fund our inventory purchases. Such issues and risks can be magnified by the diversity of product mix our business units carry, with over 10,000 SKUs across multiple major product categories. Excessive increases in the market prices of certain building products can put negative pressure on our operating cash flows by requiring us to invest\nmore in inventory. In the future, if we are unable to effectively manage our inventory as we attempt to expand our business, our cash flows may be negatively affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nIf petroleum prices increase, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nPetroleum prices have fluctuated significantly in recent years, including recent periods of historically low prices. Prices and availability of petroleum products are subject to political, economic, and market factors that are outside our control. Political events in petroleum-producing regions as well as hurricanes and other weather-related events may cause the price of fuel to increase. Within our business units, we deliver products to our customers primarily via our fleet of trucks. Our operating profit may be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain the fuel we require or to fully offset the anticipated impact of higher fuel prices through increased prices or fuel surcharges to our customers. Besides passing fuel costs on to customers, we have at times entered into forward purchase contracts that protect against fuel price increases. However, we currently are not party to any such forward contracts, and may not be able to enter into such contracts in the future on terms that are acceptable to us. If shortages occur in the supply of necessary petroleum products and we are not able to pass along the full impact of increased petroleum prices to our customers or otherwise protect ourselves by entering into forward purchase contracts, then our results of operations would be adversely affected.\nWe establish insurance-related deductible/retention reserves based on historical loss development factors, which could lead to adjustments in the future based on actual development experience.\nWe retain a significant portion of the accident risk under vehicle liability and workers\u2019 compensation insurance programs; and, beginning in fiscal 2018, we are self-insured for health insurance, which is limited by stop-loss coverage. Our self-insurance accruals are based on actuarially estimated, undiscounted cost of claims, which includes claims incurred but not reported. While we believe that our estimation processes are well designed, every estimation process is inherently subject to limitations. Fluctuations in the frequency or amount of claims make it difficult to precisely predict the ultimate cost of claims. The actual cost of claims can be different than the historical selected loss development factors because of safety performance, payment patterns, and settlement patterns.\nOur business operations could suffer significant losses from natural disasters, catastrophes, fire, or other unexpected events.\nWhile we operate our business out of 39 warehouse facilities and maintain insurance covering our facilities, including business interruption insurance, our warehouse facilities could be materially damaged by natural disasters, such as floods, tornadoes, hurricanes, and earthquakes, or by fire, adverse weather conditions, civil unrest, condemnation, or other unexpected events or disruptions to our facilities. We could incur uninsured losses and liabilities arising from such events, including damage to our reputation, and/or suffer material losses in operational capacity, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to disintermediation risk.\nAs customers continue to consolidate or otherwise increase their purchasing power, they are better able to purchase products directly from the same suppliers that use us for distribution. In addition to the threat of losing business from a customer, disintermediation puts us at risk of losing entire product lines or categories from suppliers. It also adversely impacts our ability to obtain favorable pricing from suppliers and optimize margins and revenue with respect to our customers. As a result, continued disintermediation could have a negative impact on our financial condition and operating results.\nWe are subject to pricing pressures.\nLarge customers have historically been able to exert pressure on their outside suppliers and distributors to keep prices low in the highly fragmented building materials distribution industry. In addition, continued consolidation among our customers and their customers (i.e., homebuilders), and changes in their respective purchasing policies and payment practices could result in even further pricing pressure. A decline in the prices of the products we distribute could adversely impact our operating results. When the prices of the products we distribute decline, customer demand for lower prices could result in lower sales prices and, to the extent that our inventory at the time was purchased at higher costs, lower margins. Alternatively, in a rising price environment, our suppliers may increase prices or reduce discounts on the products we distribute and we may be unable to pass on any cost increase to our customers, thereby resulting in reduced margins and profits. Furthermore, continued consolidation among our suppliers makes it more difficult for us to negotiate favorable pricing, consignment arrangements, and discount programs with our suppliers, thereby resulting in reduced margins and profits. Overall, these pricing pressures may adversely affect our operating results and cash flows.\nCustomer consolidation could result in the loss of existing customers to our competitors. We typically do not enter into minimum purchase contracts with our customers. The loss of one or more of our significant customers, or their decision to purchase our products in significantly lower quantities than they have in the past could significantly affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nOur industry is highly fragmented and competitive. If we are unable to compete effectively, our net sales and operating results may be reduced.\nThe building and industrial products distribution industry is highly fragmented and competitive, and the barriers to entry for local competitors are relatively low. Competitive factors in our industry include pricing, availability of product, service, delivery capabilities, customer relationships, geographic coverage, and breadth of product offerings. Also, financial stability is important to suppliers and customers in choosing distributors for their products, and affects the favorability of the terms on which we are able to obtain our products from our suppliers and sell our products to our customers.\nSome of our competitors have less financial leverage or are part of larger companies, and therefore may have access to greater financial and other resources than those to which we have access. Finally, we may not be able to maintain our costs at a level sufficiently low for us to compete effectively. If we are unable to compete effectively, our net sales and net income may be reduced.\nOur competitors continue to consolidate, which could cause markets to become more competitive and could negatively impact our business.\nOur competitors continue to consolidate. This consolidation is being driven by customer needs and supplier capabilities, which could cause markets to become more competitive as greater economies of scale are achieved by distributors. Customers are increasingly aware of the total costs of fulfillment and of the need to have consistent sources of supply at multiple locations. We believe these customer needs could result in fewer distributors as the remaining distributors become larger and capable of being consistent sources of supply. There can be no assurance that we will be able to take advantage effectively of this trend toward consolidation. The trend in our industry toward consolidation could make it more difficult for us to maintain operating margins.\nOur future operating results may fluctuate significantly and our current operating results may not be a good indication of our future performance. Fluctuations in our quarterly financial results could affect our stock price in the future.\nOur revenues and operating results have historically varied from period-to-period and we expect that they will continue to do so as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control. If our quarterly financial results or our predictions of future financial results fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors, our stock price could be negatively affected. Any volatility in our quarterly financial results may make it more difficult for us to raise capital in the future or pursue acquisitions that involve issuances of our stock. Our operating results for prior periods may not be effective predictors of future performance.\nFactors associated with our industry, the operation of our business and the markets for our products may cause our quarterly financial results to fluctuate, including:\n\u2022\nthe commodity nature of our products and their price movements, which are driven largely by capacity utilization rates and industry cycles that affect supply and demand;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions, including but not limited to housing starts, construction labor shortages, repair and remodel activity and commercial construction, inventory levels of new and existing homes for sale, foreclosure rates, interest rates, unemployment rates, and mortgage availability and pricing, as well as other consumer financing mechanisms, that ultimately affect demand for our products;\n\u2022\nsupply chain disruptions;\n\u2022\nthe highly competitive nature of our industry;\n\u2022\ndisintermediation;\n\u2022\nthe impact of actuarial assumptions and regulatory activity on pension costs and pension funding requirements;\n\u2022\nthe financial condition and creditworthiness of our customers;\n\u2022\nour substantial indebtedness, including the possibility that we may not generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings may not be available in amounts sufficient to fulfill our debt obligations and fund other liquidity needs;\n\u2022\ncost of compliance with government regulations;\n\u2022\nadverse customs and tariff rulings;\n\u2022\nlabor disruptions, shortages of skilled and technical labor, or increased labor costs;\n\u2022\nincreased healthcare costs;\n\u2022\nthe need to successfully implement succession plans for our senior managers and other associates;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully complete potential acquisitions or integrate efficiently acquired operations;\n\u2022\ndisruption in our information technology systems;\n\u2022\nsignificant maintenance issues or failures with respect to our tractors, trailers, forklifts, and other major equipment;\n\u2022\nsevere weather phenomena such as drought, hurricanes, tornadoes, and fire;\n\u2022\ncondemnations of all or part of our real property; and\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the market for our equity.\nAny one of the factors above or the cumulative effect of some of the factors referred to above may result in significant fluctuations in our quarterly financial and other operating results, including fluctuations in our key metrics. The variability and unpredictability could result in our failing to meet our internal operating plan or the expectations of securities analysts or investors for any period. If we fail to meet or exceed such expectations for these or any other reasons, the market price of our shares could fall substantially and we could face costly lawsuits, including securities class action suits.\nA significant percentage of our employees are unionized. Wage increases or work stoppages by our unionized employees may reduce our results of operations.\nAs of December 30, 2017, we employed approximately 1,500 persons. Approximately 34% of our employees were represented by various local labor union collective bargaining agreements (\u201cCBAs\u201d), of which approximately 11% of CBAs are up for renewal in fiscal 2018 or are currently expired and under negotiations.\nAlthough we have generally had good relations with our unionized employees, and expect to renew collective bargaining agreements as they expire, no assurances can be provided that we will be able to reach a timely agreement as to the renewal of the agreements, and their expiration or continued work under an expired agreement, as applicable, could result in a work stoppage. In addition, we may become subject to material cost increases, or additional work rules imposed by agreements with labor unions. The foregoing could increase our selling, general, and administrative expenses in absolute terms and/or as a percentage of net sales. In addition, work stoppages or other labor disturbances may occur in the future, which could adversely impact our net sales and/or selling, general, and administrative expenses. All of these factors could negatively impact our operating results and cash flows.\nOur ability to utilize our net operating loss carryovers may be limited.\nAt December 30, 2017, we had net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforwards of approximately $158.2 million. Under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income may be limited. In general, an \u201cownership change\u201d will occur if there is a cumulative change in our ownership by \u201c5-percent stockholders\u201d that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws.\nSales in the underwritten public offering of 4,443,428 shares of our common stock by our former majority shareholder, an affiliate of Cerberus Capital Management, L.P. (\u201cCerberus\u201d), that closed on October 23, 2017 (the \u201cResale Offering\u201d) caused an ownership change limitation under Section 382 to be triggered. That limitation could restrict our ability to use our NOL carryforwards if our anticipated real estate sales over the next five years are not realized for any reason. Limitations on our ability to use NOL carryforwards to offset future taxable income, including gains on sales of real estate, could require us to pay U.S. federal income taxes earlier than would be required if such limitations were not in effect. Similar rules and limitations may apply for state income tax purposes.\nChanges in actuarial assumptions for our pension plan could impact our financial results, and funding requirements are mandated by the Federal government.\nWe sponsor a defined benefit pension plan. Most of the participants in our pension plan are inactive, with the majority of the remaining active participants no longer accruing benefits; and the pension plan is closed to new entrants. However, unfavorable changes in various assumptions underlying the pension benefit obligation could adversely impact our financial results. Significant assumptions include, but are not limited to, the discount rate, projected return on plan assets, and mortality rates. In addition, the amount and timing of our pension funding obligations are influenced by funding requirements that are established by the Employee Retirement Income and Security Act of 1974 (\u201cERISA\u201d), the Pension Protection Act, Congressional Acts, or other governing bodies.\nCosts and liabilities related to our participation in multi-employer pension plans could increase.\nWe participate in various multi-employer pension plans in the U.S. based on obligations arising under collective bargaining\nagreements. Some of these plans are significantly underfunded and may require increased contributions in the future. The amount of any increase or decrease in our required contributions to these multi-employer pension plans will depend upon the outcome of collective bargaining, actions taken by trustees who manage the plan, governmental regulations, the actual return on assets held in the plan, the continued viability and contributions of other employers which contribute to the plan, and the potential payment of a withdrawal liability, among other factors.\nUnder current law, an employer that withdraws or partially withdraws from a multi-employer pension plan may incur a withdrawal liability to the plan, which represents the portion of the plan\u2019s underfunding that is allocable to the withdrawing employer under very complex actuarial and allocation rules. We have withdrawn from certain multi-employer plans in the past, including, most recently, in connection with a new collective bargaining agreement that we entered into with the Lumber Employees Local 786 union at our Chicago facility in the first quarter of 2017 (in which case we recorded a total estimated withdrawal liability of $5.0 million during fiscal 2017). We may withdraw from other multi-employer plans in the future. If, in the future, we do choose to withdraw from any additional multi-employer plans or trigger a partial withdrawal, we likely would need to record a withdrawal liability, which may be material to our financial results. Additionally, a mass withdrawal would require us to record a withdrawal liability, which may be material to our financial results, and would generally obligate us to make payments in perpetuity to the particular plan.\nOne of the plans to which we are obligated to contribute is the Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Fund (the \u201cCentral States Plan\u201d). As of January 1, 2017, the plan\u2019s actuary certified that the plan was in critical and declining status, which, among other things, means the funded percentage of the plan was less than 65%. Furthermore, the plan is projected to become insolvent in 2025. It is unclear what will happen to this plan in the future. Our required contributions to the plan may increase, due to potential rehabilitation increases. In addition, if we experience a withdrawal from this plan, we may need to record a significant withdrawal liability. Our estimated withdrawal liability is $37.3 million if we experience a complete withdrawal from the plan during fiscal 2018. This number will likely increase if a complete withdrawal occurs in fiscal 2019 or later, and could be significantly higher if a mass withdrawal were to occur in the future.\nIn the case of both a complete withdrawal and a mass withdrawal, our payments to the Central States Plan would generally continue at approximately the current rate; which, even with potential rehabilitation increases, is less than $1.0 million per year. In a complete withdrawal, the payments would not amortize the liability fully; however, payments for a complete withdrawal are limited to a 20-year period. In the case of a mass withdrawal, the liability would never amortize, and payments would continue indefinitely.\nWe are subject to information technology security risks and business interruption risks, and may incur increasing costs in an effort to minimize those risks.\nOur business employs information technology systems to secure confidential information, such as employee data, including social security numbers and personal health data. Security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, litigation, and potential liability. We may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent rapidly evolving types of cyber attacks. Any compromise of our security could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, interruption of our business operations, and a loss of confidence in our security measures; all of which could harm our business. We may also be subject to phishing attacks, wherein individuals may fraudulently purport to be an agent of a reputable company in order to induce our employees to reveal information or obtain resources. We are also susceptible to malware, ransomware, denial of service, and other attacks that could adversely affect our information technology systems. As cyber attacks become more sophisticated generally, we may incur significant costs to strengthen our systems from outside intrusions, and/or obtain insurance coverage related to the threat of such attacks.\nAdditionally, our business is reliant upon information technology systems to, among other things, manage and route our sales calls, manage inventories and accounts receivable, make purchasing decisions, monitor our results of operations, and place orders with our vendors and process orders from our customers. Disruption in these systems could materially impact our ability to buy and sell our products, as well as generally operate our business.\nOur success depends on our ability to attract, train, and retain highly qualified associates and other key personnel while controlling related labor costs.\nTo be successful, we must attract, train, and retain a large number of highly qualified associates while controlling related labor costs. In many of our markets, highly qualified associates are in high demand and we compete with other businesses for these associates and invest significant resources in training and incentivizing them. There can be no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified associates in the future, including, in particular, those employed by companies we may acquire. Our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including prevailing wage rates and health and other insurance costs.\nIn addition, there is significant competition for qualified drivers in the transportation industry. Additionally, interventions and enforcement under the FMCSA Compliance, Safety, and Accountability program may shrink the industry\u2019s pool of drivers as those drivers with unfavorable scores may no longer be eligible to drive for us. As a result of driver shortages, we could be required to increase driver compensation, let trucks sit idle, utilize less experienced drivers, or face difficulty meeting customer demands, all of which could adversely affect our growth and profitability.\nFurthermore, our success is highly dependent on the continued services of our management team. The loss of services of one or more key members of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on us.\nFederal, state, local, and other regulations could impose substantial costs and restrictions on our operations that would reduce our net income.\nWe are subject to various federal, state, local, and other laws and regulations, including, among other things, transportation regulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of Transportation (the \u201cDOT\u201d), work safety regulations promulgated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, employment regulations promulgated by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, regulations of the U.S. Department of Labor, accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the \u201cFASB\u201d) or similar entities, and state and local zoning restrictions, building codes and contractors\u2019 licensing regulations. More burdensome regulatory requirements in these or other areas may increase our general and administrative costs and adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows. Moreover, failure to comply with the regulatory requirements applicable to our business could expose us to litigation and substantial fines and penalties that could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.\nOur transportation operations, upon which we depend to distribute products from our distribution centers, are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the DOT and the FMCSA, which have broad administrative powers with respect to our transportation operations. Vehicle dimensions and driver hours of service also are subject to both federal and state regulation. More restrictive limitations on vehicle weight and size, trailer length and configuration, or driver hours of service would increase our costs, which, if we are unable to pass these cost increases on to our customers, may increase our selling, general and administrative expenses and adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows. If we fail to comply adequately with the DOT and FMCSA regulations or such regulations become more stringent, we could experience increased inspections, regulatory authorities could take remedial action, including imposing fines or shutting down our operations, or we could be subject to increased audit and compliance costs. If any of these events were to occur, our financial condition, operating results, and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, the residential and commercial construction industries are subject to various local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, codes, rules and regulations concerning zoning, building design and safety, construction, contractor licensing, energy conservation and similar matters, including regulations that impose restrictive zoning and density requirements on the residential new construction industry or that limit the number of homes or other buildings that can be built within the boundaries of a particular area. Regulatory restrictions may increase our operating expenses and limit the availability of suitable building lots for our customers, any of which could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe could be the subject of securities class action litigation due to future stock price volatility, which could divert management\u2019s attention and adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe stock market in general, and market prices for the securities of companies like ours in particular, have from time to time experienced volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of the underlying companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In certain situations in which the market price of a stock has been volatile, holders of that stock have instituted securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock. If any of our stockholders were to bring a similar lawsuit against us, the defense and disposition of the lawsuit could be costly and divert the time and attention of our management and harm our operating results.\nOur operating results depend on the successful implementation of our strategy. We may not be able to implement our strategic initiatives successfully, on a timely basis, or at all.\nWe regularly evaluate the performance of our business and, as a result of such evaluations, we have in the past undertaken and may in the future undertake strategic initiatives within our businesses. Strategic initiatives that we may implement now or in the future may not result in improvements in future financial performance and could result in additional unanticipated costs. If we are unable to realize the benefits of our strategic initiatives, our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to federal, state, and local environmental protection laws and may have to incur significant costs to comply with these laws and regulations in the future.\nEnvironmental liabilities could arise on the land that we have owned, own or lease and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and performance. Federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require a current or previous owner or operator of real estate to investigate and remediate hazardous materials, substances and waste releases at or from the property. They may also impose liability for property damage and personal injury stemming from the presence of, or exposure to, hazardous substances. In addition, we could incur costs to comply with such environmental laws and regulations, the violation of which could lead to substantial fines and penalties.\nWe do not expect to pay dividends on our common stock so any returns to stockholders will be limited to the value of their stock.\nWe have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock since 2007, and we are restricted from doing so under the terms of our Credit Agreement. Regardless of the restrictions in our Credit Agreement or the terms of any potential future indebtedness, for the foreseeable future we anticipate that we will retain all available funds and earnings to support our operations and finance the growth and development of our business. Therefore, we do not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future, so any return to stockholders will be limited to the appreciation of their stock.\nChanges in, or interpretation of, accounting principles could result in unfavorable accounting changes.\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and accompanying accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines, and interpretations. These rules are subject to interpretation by the SEC and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles. Changes in these rules or their interpretation could significantly change our reported results and may even retroactively affect previously reported transactions. Changes resulting from the adoption of new or revised accounting principles may result in materially different financial results and may require that we make changes to our systems, processes, and controls.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.\nOur second amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for: any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty; any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws; or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. The choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and other employees. If a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business and financial condition.\nAny issuance of preferred stock could make it difficult for another company to acquire us or could otherwise adversely affect holders of our common stock, which could adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nOur board of directors has the authority to issue preferred stock and to determine the preferences, limitations, and relative rights of shares of preferred stock and to fix the number of shares constituting any series and the designation of such series, without any further vote or action by our stockholders. Our preferred stock could be issued with voting, liquidation, dividend, and other rights superior to the rights of our common stock. The potential issuance of preferred stock may delay or prevent a change in control of us, discouraging bids for our common stock at a premium over the market price, and adversely affect the market price and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 90496, "SIC": 5031, "TIC": "BXC"}
