RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our common stock involves a number of very significant risks. You should carefully consider the following risks and uncertainties in addition to other information in this report in evaluating our company and its business before purchasing shares of our company's common stock. Our business, operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed due to any of the following risks. You could lose all or part of your investment due to any of these risks.\nRisks Related to Our Company and POC Business\nWe will need to deploy our capital from the sale of Masthercell in a manner to scale our POC business to show demonstrable revenue and market value for our shareholders, the failure of which could adversely impact our operations and the price of our stock.\nOn February 2, 2020, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the \"Purchase Agreement\") with GPP-II Masthercell LLC (\"GPP\" and together with Orgenesis, the \"Sellers\"), Masthercell Global Inc. (\"Masthercell\") and Catalent Pharma Solutions, Inc. (the \"Buyer\"). Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Purchase Agreement, on February 10, 2020, the Sellers sold 100% of the outstanding equity interests of Masthercell to Buyer (the \"Sale\") for an aggregate nominal purchase price of $315 million, subject to customary adjustments. After accounting for GPP's liquidation preference and equity stake in Masthercell as well as SFPI - FPIM's interest in MaSTherCell S.A., distributions to Masthercell option holders and transaction costs, we received approximately $126.7 million at the closing of the Sale transaction, of which $7.2 million was used for the repayment of intercompany loans and payables.\nWe expect to use the net proceeds from the sale of Masthercell to continue to grow our POC cell therapy business and to further the development of ATMPs. Although we now have sufficient capital resources for the next 12 months and the foreseeable future, we may not be able to implement our POC business and commence clinical trials for our diabetes solution or respond to competitive pressures due to other non-financial factors beyond our control.\nWe are not profitable as of December 31, 2019, have limited cash flow and, unless we increase revenues and take advantage of any commercial opportunities that arise to expand our POC business, the perceived value of our company may decrease and our stock price could be affected accordingly.\nFor the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 and as of the date of this report, we assessed our financial condition and concluded that we have sufficient resources for the next 12 months from the date of the report as a result of the receipt of the net proceeds from the sale of Masthercell. Our auditor's report for the year ended December 31, 2019 does not include a going concern opinion on the matter. However, management is unable to predict if and when we will be able to generate significant revenues or achieve profitability. Our plan regarding these matters is to continue improving the net results in our POC business into fiscal year 2020. There can be no assurances that we will be successful in increasing revenues, improving our POC results or that the perceived value of our company will increase. In the event that we are unable to generate significant revenues in our POC business, our stock price could be adversely affected.\nWe will need to grow the size and capabilities of our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing this growth.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had 309 employees. Following the sale of Masthercell, we had 71 employees. As our development and commercialization plans and strategies develop, we must add a significant number of additional managerial, operational, sales, marketing, financial, and other personnel. Future growth will impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including:\nidentifying, recruiting, integrating, maintaining, and motivating additional employees;\nmanaging our internal development efforts effectively, including the clinical and FDA review process for our product candidates, while complying with our contractual obligations to contractors and other third parties; and\nimproving our operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems, and procedures.\nOur future financial performance and our ability to commercialize our product candidates will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively manage any future growth, and our management may also have to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from day-to-day activities in order to devote a substantial amount of time to managing these growth activities. This lack of long-term experience working together may adversely impact our senior management team's ability to effectively manage our business and growth.\nWe currently rely, and for the foreseeable future will continue to rely, in substantial part on certain independent organizations, advisors and consultants to provide certain services. There can be no assurance that the services of these independent organizations, advisors and consultants will continue to be available to us on a timely basis when needed, or that we can find qualified replacements. In addition, if we are unable to effectively manage our outsourced activities or if the quality or accuracy of the services provided by consultants is compromised for any reason, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed, or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates or otherwise advance our business. There can be no assurance that we will be able to manage our existing consultants or find other competent outside contractors and consultants on economically reasonable terms, if at all. If we are not able to effectively expand our organization by hiring new employees and expanding our groups of consultants and contractors, we may not be able to successfully implement the tasks necessary to further develop and commercialize our product candidates and, accordingly, may not achieve our research, development, and commercialization goals.\nWe depend on key personnel who would be difficult to replace, and our business plans will likely be harmed if we lose their services or cannot hire additional qualified personnel.\nOur success depends substantially on the efforts and abilities of our senior management and certain key personnel. The competition for qualified management and key personnel, especially engineers, is intense. The loss of services of one or more of our key employees, or the inability to hire, train, and retain key personnel, especially engineers and technical support personnel, could delay the development and sale of our products, disrupt our business, and interfere with our ability to execute our business plan.\nCurrency exchange fluctuations may impact the results of our operations.\nThe provision of services by our subsidiary, Masthercell Global, were usually transacted in U.S. dollars and European currencies during the year ended December 31, 2019. Our results of operations are affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates in both sourcing and selling locations. Our results of operations may still be impacted by foreign currency exchange rates, primarily, the euro-to-U.S. dollar exchange rate. In recent years, the euro-to-U.S. dollar exchange rate has been subject to substantial volatility which may continue, particularly in light of recent political events regarding the European Union, or EU. Because we do not hedge against all of our foreign currency exposure, our business will continue to be susceptible to foreign currency fluctuations.\nWe have entered into collaborations and may form or seek collaborations or strategic alliances or enter into additional licensing arrangements in the future, and we may not realize the benefits of such alliances or licensing arrangements.\nWe may form or seek strategic alliances, create joint ventures or collaborations, or enter into additional licensing arrangements with third parties that we believe will complement or augment our development and commercialization efforts with respect to our product candidates and any future product candidates that we may develop. Any of these relationships may require us to incur non-recurring and other charges, increase our near and long-term expenditures, issue securities that dilute our existing stockholders, or disrupt our management and business. In addition, we face significant competition in seeking appropriate strategic partners for which the negotiation process is time-consuming and complex. Moreover, we may not be successful in our efforts to establish a strategic partnership or other alternative arrangements for our product candidates because they may be deemed to be at too early of a stage of development for collaborative effort and third parties may not view our product candidates as having the requisite potential to demonstrate safety and efficacy. Further, collaborations involving our product candidates, such as our collaborations with third-party research institutions, are subject to numerous risks, which may include the following:\ncollaborators have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to a collaboration;\ncollaborators may not pursue development and commercialization of our product candidates or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs based on clinical trial results, changes in their strategic focus due to the acquisition of competitive products, availability of funding, or other external factors, such as a business combination that diverts resources or creates competing priorities;\ncollaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial, stop a clinical trial, abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials, or require a new formulation of a product candidate for clinical testing;\ncollaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with our products or product candidates;\na collaborator with marketing and distribution rights to one or more products may not commit sufficient resources to their marketing and distribution;\ncollaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our intellectual property or proprietary information in a way that gives rise to actual or threatened litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to potential liability;\ndisputes may arise between us and a collaborator that cause the delay or termination of the research, development or commercialization of our product candidates, or that result in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts management attention and resources;\ncollaborations may be terminated and, if terminated, may result in a need for additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable product candidates; and\ncollaborators may own or co-own intellectual property covering our products that results from our collaborating with them and, in such cases, we would not have the exclusive right to commercialize such intellectual property.\nAs a result, if we enter into collaboration agreements and strategic partnerships or license our products or businesses, we may not be able to realize the benefit of such transactions if we are unable to successfully integrate them with our existing operations and company culture, which could delay our timelines or otherwise adversely affect our business. We also cannot be certain that, following a strategic transaction or license, we will achieve the revenue or specific net income that justifies such transaction. Any delays in entering into new collaborations or strategic partnership agreements related to our product candidates could delay the development and commercialization of our product candidates in certain geographies for certain indications, which would harm our business prospects, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur success depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property and our proprietary technologies.\nOur commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection and trade secret protection for our product candidates, proprietary technologies, and their uses as well as our ability to operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others. We can provide no assurance that our patent applications or those of our licensors will result in additional patents being issued or that issued patents will afford sufficient protection against competitors with similar technologies, nor can there be any assurance that the patents issued will not be infringed, designed around or invalidated by third parties. Even issued patents may later be found unenforceable or may be modified or revoked in proceedings instituted by third parties before various patent offices or in courts. The degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain. Only limited protection may be available and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage. Composition-of-matter patents on the biological or chemical active pharmaceutical ingredients are generally considered to offer the strongest protection of intellectual property and provide the broadest scope of patent protection for pharmaceutical products, as such patents provide protection without regard to any method of use or any method of manufacturing. While we have an issued patent in the United States with a claim for a composition directed to a vector comprising a promoter linked to a pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 (PDX-1) polypeptide, and a carrier, a multicompartment hydrogels, epithelial organoids, tissue grafts, and compositions comprising sulfated polysaccharides, we cannot be certain that the claim in our issued patent will not be found invalid or unenforceable if challenged.\nWe cannot be certain that the claims in our issued United States methods of use patents will not be found invalid or unenforceable if challenged. We cannot be certain that the pending applications covering composition-of-matter of our transdifferentiated cell populations will be considered patentable by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), and courts in the United States or by the patent offices and courts in foreign countries, nor can we be certain that the claims in our issued patents will not be found invalid or unenforceable if challenged. Even if our patent applications covering populations of transdifferentiated cells issue as patents, the patents protect a specific transdifferentiated cell product and may not be enforced against competitors making and marketing a product that has the same activity. Method-of-use patents protect the use of a product for the specified method or for treatment of a particular indication. This type of patents may not be enforced against competitors making and marketing a product that has cells that may provide the same activity but is used for a method not included in the patent. Moreover, even if competitors do not actively promote their product for our targeted indications, physicians may prescribe these products \"off-label.\" Although off-label prescriptions may infringe or contribute to the infringement of method-of-use patents, the practice is common and such infringement is difficult to prevent or prosecute.\nWe have exclusive rights to ten (10) United States (US) patents, one (1) of which is directed, among others, to a composition comprising a vector comprising a promoter linked to PDX-1 and having a term of 2021, three (3) having a term of 2023 and directed, among others, to methods of inducing endogenous PDX-1 expression in a human differentiated primary non-pancreatic cell, inducing or enhancing a pancreatic islet cell phenotype in non-pancreatic cells, and increasing PDX-1 induction in non-pancreatic primary cells; one (1) having a term of 2024 and directed, among others, to components of a bioreactor; two (2) having a term of 2026 and directed, among others, to a bioconjugate molecules comprising a sulfated polysaccharide; one (1) having a term of 2027 and directed, among others, to an epithelial organoid; one (1) having a term of 2033 and directed, among others, to methods for producing scaffolds; and one (1) having a term of 2034 and directed, among others, to methods for producing transdifferentiated cells. Further, we have exclusive rights to nineteen (19) foreign issued patents (six (6) patents granted in Australia, France, Germany, Israel, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, having a term between 2025 and 2027, directed among others to compositions comprising sulfated polysaccharide bioconjugate, and to epithelial organoids having liver phenotype; eight (8) patents granted in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, and the United Kingdom, having a term between 2020 and 2024, and directed among others to methods of inducing pancreatic hormone expression, methods of inducing a beta cell phenotype, and methods of producing hydrogel; and five (5) patents granted in Austria, France, Germany, Israel, and the United Kingdom, having a term of 2024 and directed among others to components of a bioreactor. We also have nine (9) pending applications in the United States, which if granted would have a term of 2036-2038; thirty two (32) pending applications in foreign jurisdictions, including Europe, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Eurasia, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, and Singapore, which if they were to be granted would have a term of 2026-2036; and four (4) International Patent Cooperation Treaty (\"PCT\") patent applications, which if filed and granted as national phase applications would have a term of 2028. These pending applications are directed, among others, to the trans-differentiation of cells (including hepatic cells) to cells having pancreatic \u03b2-cell phenotype and function, and their use in the treatment of degenerative pancreatic disorders including diabetes, pancreatic cancer, and pancreatitis; and to scaffolds, including alginate and sulfated alginate scaffolds, polysaccharides thereof, and scaffolds for use for cell propagation, trans-differentiation, and transplantation in the treatment of autoimmune diseases, including diabetes..\nThe patent application process is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, and there can be no assurance that we or any of our future development partners will be successful in protecting our product candidates by obtaining and defending patents. These risks and uncertainties include the following:\nthe USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other provisions during the patent process. There are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, competitors might be able to enter the market earlier than would otherwise have been the case;\npatent applications may not result in any patents being issued;\npatents that may be issued or in-licensed may be challenged, invalidated, modified, revoked, circumvented, found to be unenforceable or otherwise may not provide any competitive advantage;\nour competitors, many of whom have substantially greater resources and many of whom have made significant investments in competing technologies, may seek or may have already obtained patents that will limit, interfere with or eliminate our ability to make, use, and sell our potential product candidates;\nthere may be significant pressure on the U.S. government and international governmental bodies to limit the scope of patent protection both inside and outside the United States for disease treatments that prove successful, as a matter of public policy regarding worldwide health concerns; and\ncountries other than the United States may have patent laws less favorable to patentees than those upheld by U.S. courts, allowing foreign competitors a better opportunity to create, develop and market competing product candidates.\nIn addition, we rely on the protection of our trade secrets and proprietary know-how. Although we have taken steps to protect our trade secrets and unpatented know-how, including entering into confidentiality agreements with third parties, and confidential information and inventions agreements with employees, consultants and advisors, we cannot provide any assurances that all such agreements have been duly executed, and third parties may still obtain this information or may come upon this or similar information independently. Additionally, if the steps taken to maintain our trade secrets are deemed inadequate, we may have insufficient recourse against third parties for misappropriating its trade secrets. If any of these events occurs or if we otherwise lose protection for our trade secrets or proprietary know-how, our business may be harmed.\nIf product liability lawsuits are brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of our product candidates.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability as a result of the clinical testing of our product candidates and will face an even greater risk if we commercialize any products. For example, we may be sued if our product candidates cause or are perceived to cause injury or are found to be otherwise unsuitable during clinical testing, manufacturing, marketing or sale. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product, negligence, strict liability or a breach of warranties. Claims could also be asserted under state consumer protection acts. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization of our product candidates. Even a successful defense would require significant financial and management resources. Regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\ndecreased demand for our products;\ninjury to our reputation;\nwithdrawal of clinical trial participants and inability to continue clinical trials;\ninitiation of investigations by regulators;\ncosts to defend the related litigation;\na diversion of management's time and our resources;\nsubstantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;\nproduct recalls, withdrawals or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions;\nloss of revenue;\nexhaustion of any available insurance and our capital resources;\nthe inability to commercialize any product candidate; and\na decline in our share price.\nBecause our products have not reached clinical or commercial stage, we do not currently carry clinical trial or product liability insurance. In the future, our inability to obtain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable cost to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of products we develop, alone or with collaborators. Such insurance policies may also have various exclusions, and we may be subject to a product liability claim for which we have no coverage.\nIt may be difficult to enforce a U.S. judgment against us, our officers and directors and the foreign persons named in this Annual Report on Form 10-K in the United States or in foreign countries , or to assert U.S. securities laws claims in foreign countries or serve process on our officers and directors and these experts.\nWhile we are incorporated in the State of Nevada, currently a majority of our directors and executive officers are not residents of the United States, and the foreign persons named in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are located in Israel and Belgium. The majority of our assets are located outside the United States. Therefore, it may be difficult for an investor, or any other person or entity, to enforce a U.S. court judgment based upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws against us or any of these persons in a U.S. or foreign court, or to effect service of process upon these persons in the United States. Additionally, it may be difficult for an investor, or any other person or entity, to assert U.S. securities law claims in original actions instituted in foreign countries in which we operate. Foreign courts may refuse to hear a claim based on a violation of U.S. securities laws on the grounds that foreign countries are not necessary the most appropriate forum in which to bring such a claim. Even if a foreign court agrees to hear a claim, it may determine that foreign law and not U.S. law is applicable to the claim. If U.S. law is found to be applicable, the content of applicable U.S. law must be proved as a fact, which can be a time-consuming and costly process. Certain matters of procedure will also be governed by foreign countries law. There is little binding case law in foreign countries addressing the matters described above.\nWe may be subject to numerous and varying privacy and security laws, and our failure to comply could result in penalties and reputational damage.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations covering data privacy and the protection of personal information, including health information. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing focus on privacy and data protection issues which may affect our business. In the U.S., numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including state security breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws, govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of personal information. Each of these laws is subject to varying interpretations by courts and government agencies, creating complex compliance issues for us. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could be subject to penalties or sanctions, including criminal penalties if we knowingly obtain or disclose individually identifiable health information from a covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HIPAA.\nNumerous other countries have, or are developing, laws governing the collection, use and transmission of personal information as well. The EU and other jurisdictions have adopted data protection laws and regulations, which impose significant compliance obligations. In the EU, for example, effective May 25, 2018, the GDPR replaced the prior EU Data Protection Directive (95/46) that governed the processing of personal data in the European Union. The GDPR imposes significant obligations on controllers and processors of personal data, including, as compared to the prior directive, higher standards for obtaining consent from individuals to process their personal data, more robust notification requirements to individuals about the processing of their personal data, a strengthened individual data rights regime, mandatory data breach notifications, limitations on the retention of personal data and increased requirements pertaining to health data, and strict rules and restrictions on the transfer of personal data outside of the EU, including to the U.S. The GDPR also imposes additional obligations on, and required contractual provisions to be included in, contracts between companies subject to the GDPR and their third-party processors that relate to the processing of personal data. The GDPR allows EU member states to make additional laws and regulations further limiting the processing of genetic, biometric or health data.\nAdoption of the GDPR increased our responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process and may require us to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance. Any failure to comply with the requirements of GDPR and applicable national data protection laws of EU member states, could lead to regulatory enforcement actions and significant administrative and/or financial penalties against us (fines of up to Euro 20,000,000 or up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher), and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nWe are increasingly dependent on information technology and our systems and infrastructure face certain risks, including cybersecurity and data storage risks.\nSignificant disruptions to our information technology systems or breaches of information security could adversely affect our business. In the ordinary course of business, we collect, store and transmit confidential information, and it is critical that we do so in a secure manner in order to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of such confidential information. Our information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to service interruptions and security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees, partners, vendors, or from attacks by malicious third parties. Maintaining the secrecy of this confidential, proprietary, and/or trade secret information is important to our competitive business position. While we have taken steps to protect such information and invested in information technology, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent service interruptions or security breaches in our systems or the unauthorized or inadvertent wrongful access or disclosure of confidential information that could adversely affect our business operations or result in the loss, dissemination, or misuse of critical or sensitive information. A breach of our security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure, unapproved dissemination or misappropriation or misuse of trade secrets, proprietary information, or other confidential information, whether as a result of theft, hacking, or other forms of deception, or for any other cause, could enable others to produce competing products, use our proprietary technology and/or adversely affect our business position. Further, any such interruption, security breach, loss or disclosure of confidential information could result in financial, legal, business, and reputational harm to us and could have a material effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and/or cash flow.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to develop in-house sales and commercial distribution capabilities or establish or maintain relationships with third-party collaborators to successfully commercialize any product in the United States or overseas, and as a result, we may not be able to generate product revenue.\nA variety of risks associated with operating our business internationally could materially adversely affect our business. We plan to seek regulatory approval of our product candidates outside of the United States and, accordingly, we expect that we, and any potential collaborators in those jurisdictions, will be subject to additional risks related to operating in foreign countries, including:\ndiffering regulatory requirements in foreign countries, unexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers, price and exchange controls, and other regulatory requirements;\neconomic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets;\ncompliance with tax, employment, immigration, and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad;\nforeign taxes, including withholding of payroll taxes;\nforeign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenue, and other obligations incident to doing business in another country;\ndifficulties staffing and managing foreign operations;\nworkforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States;\npotential liability under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 or comparable foreign laws;\nchallenges enforcing our contractual and intellectual property rights, especially in those foreign countries that do not respect and protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the United States;\nproduction shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad; and\nbusiness interruptions resulting from geo-political actions, including war, and terrorism or disease outbreaks (such as the recent outbreak of COVID-19, or the novel coronavirus).\nThese and other risks associated with our planned international operations may materially adversely affect our ability to attain or maintain profitable operations.\nRisks Related to the Sale of Masthercell\nOur results of operations will differ materially from any expectations or guidance previously provided by us concerning future financial results, and our future financial results will be dependent on our ability to grow our POC business.\nMasthercell and our CDMO business accounted for most of our revenues. Accordingly, following the consummation of the sale of Masthercell, our financial results will differ materially from our previous results and the guidance and expectations we had previously provided. In addition, our future financial results will be dependent primarily on our ability to grow our POC business. See \"Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Company and POC Business\" in this report for a description of the risks related to our POC business.\nThe failure to effectively utilize the proceeds from the sale of Masthercell may adversely affect our business.\nThe proceeds from the sale of Masthercell were received by us and not our shareholders. We used or will use a portion of the proceeds to repay certain outstanding indebtedness and to pay for certain additional transaction costs associated with the sale. We will also be paying taxes on the proceeds. The remainder of the proceeds may be used, at the discretion of our Board of Directors, for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including, among other things, to grow our POC business and to further the development of Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products. We could also potentially identify and acquire, or partner on the development of, other product candidates. However, we do not have agreements or commitments for any such acquisitions or partnerships at this time. Our failure to effectively utilize the proceeds from the sale of Masthercell could adversely affect our ability to successfully grow our POC business and develop cell therapy product candidates, which could cause the value of your investment in Orgenesis to decline.\nThe announcement of the sale of Masthercell may adversely affect our POC business and other activities.\nThe announcement of the sale of Masthercell may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock, our business and our relationships with clients, customers, suppliers and employees. Additionally, employees working in our POC business may become concerned about the future of such business, and lose focus or seek other employment.\nWe are subject to a non-competition covenant under the Purchase Agreement, which will limit our ability to engage in the CDMO business except with respect to certain of our subsidiaries' operations in South Korea and Israel.\nFor a period of three (3) years in the European Union and five (5) years in the United States and the rest of the world (other than the European Union), and a period of three (3) years in the European Union, in each case from and after the sale of Masthercell February 10, 2020 closing date (the \"Non-Competition Period\"), we are subject to a non-competition covenant made in the Purchase Agreement that restricts our ability to engage in the CDMO business except with respect to certain of our subsidiaries' operations in South Korea and Israel. During the Non-Competition Period, we will be restricted from engaging in the business of providing on a contract basis to third-party customers cell or gene therapy development, analytical or manufacturing services or related products, including the development, analysis and manufacture of plasmids or genetically modified autologous or allogeneic cells; other cell characterization and engineering services; related analytical or bioanalytical services; or related fill and finish or other packaging services; provided, however, that we shall not be restricted from engaging in (i) our current or currently proposed POC business, (ii) research, manufacturing, development and other activities related to the research, development, manufacturing, discovery and commercialization of therapeutic products or technologies or (iii) our subsidiaries' CDMO operations in South Korea and Israel. This limitation may negatively impact the scope and/or volume of our business, which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, certain third party acquirers of our current business would be subject to these limitations during the Non-Competition Period, which may limit our opportunities with respect to a future sale transaction of our current business during the Non-Competition Period that may otherwise be favorable to our stockholders.\nWe are obligated to indemnify Catalent for certain losses resulting from breaches of certain representation and warranties set forth in the Purchase Agreement relating to the sale of Masthercell.\nUnder the terms of the Purchase Agreement, we are obligated to indemnify Catalent for certain losses resulting from breaches of certain representations and warranties in the Purchase Agreement as well as certain litigation relating to the sale of Masthercell. Any and all such liability would reduce the net proceeds from the sale of Masthercell that are available for our use.\nWe may be exposed to litigation related to the sale of Masthercell from the holders of our stock.\nTransactions such as the sale of Masthercell are sometimes subject to lawsuits by stockholders. Because the holders of our stock did not receive any consideration from the sale of Masthercell, it is possible that they may sue us or our Board of Directors. Such lawsuits could result in substantial costs and divert our management's attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business.\nBecause we are expected to have significantly less revenue and significantly fewer assets following the sale of Masthercell, there is a possibility that such lack of revenues and diminished assets may affect our ability to satisfy the continued listing standards of the Nasdaq, which could result in the delisting of our common stock.\nThe continued listing standards of the Nasdaq Capital Market include, among other things, requirements that we maintain certain levels of stockholders' equity, market capitalization and/or minimum trading price. Even though we currently satisfy these requirements, following the sale of Masthercell, we will be smaller with limited revenue and significantly fewer assets, which may cause us to fail to satisfy the continued listing standards of the Nasdaq Capital Market. In the event that we are unable to satisfy such continued listing standards, our common stock may be delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market. Any delisting of our common stock from such market could adversely affect our ability to attract new investors, decrease the liquidity of our outstanding shares of common stock, reduce our flexibility to raise additional capital, reduce the price at which our common stock trades and increase the transaction costs inherent in trading such shares with overall negative effects for our stockholders. In addition, delisting of our common stock could deter broker-dealers from making a market in or otherwise seeking or generating interest in our common stock, and might deter certain institutions and persons from investing in our securities at all. For these reasons and others, delisting could adversely affect the price of our common stock, our business, our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Trans-Differentiation Technologies for Diabetes\nTHM is entitled to cancel the THM License Agreement.\nPursuant to the terms of the THM License Agreement with THM, the Israeli Subsidiary must develop, manufacture, sell and market the products pursuant to the milestones and time schedule specified in the development plan. In the event the Israeli Subsidiary fails to fulfill the terms of the development plan under the THM License Agreement, THM shall be entitled to terminate the THM License Agreement by providing the Israeli Subsidiary with written notice of such a breach and if the Israeli Subsidiary does not cure such breach within one year of receiving the notice. If THM cancels the THM License Agreement, our POC business may be materially adversely affected. THM may also terminate the THM License Agreement if the Israeli Subsidiary breaches an obligation contained in the THM License Agreement and does not cure it within 180 days of receiving notice of the breach. Any termination or cancellation of the THM License Agreement is likely to materially adversely affect our business and prospects.\nOur success will depend on strategic collaborations with third parties to develop and commercialize therapeutic product candidates, and we may not have control over a number of key elements relating to the development and commercialization of any such product candidate.\nA key aspect of our strategy is to seek collaboration with a partner, such as a large pharmaceutical organization, that is willing to further develop and commercialize a selected product candidate. To date, we have not entered into any such collaborative arrangement. By entering into any such strategic collaboration, we may rely on our partner for financial resources and for development, regulatory and commercialization expertise. Our partner may fail to develop or effectively commercialize our product candidate because they:\ndo not have sufficient resources or decide not to devote the necessary resources due to internal constraints such as limited cash or human resources;\ndecide to pursue a competitive potential product developed outside of the collaboration;\ncannot obtain the necessary regulatory approvals;\ndetermine that the market opportunity is not attractive; or\ncannot manufacture or obtain the necessary materials in sufficient quantities from multiple sources or at a reasonable cost.\nWe may not be able to enter into a collaboration on acceptable terms, if at all. We face competition in our search for partners from other organizations worldwide, many of whom are larger and are able to offer more attractive deals in terms of financial commitments, contribution of human resources, or development, manufacturing, regulatory or commercial expertise and support. If we are not successful in attracting a partner and entering into a collaboration on acceptable terms, we may not be able to complete development of or commercialize any product candidate. In such event, our ability to generate revenues and achieve or sustain profitability would be significantly hindered and we may not be able to continue operations as proposed, requiring us to modify our business plan, curtail various aspects of our operations or cease operations.\nThird parties to whom we may license or transfer development and commercialization rights for products covered by intellectual property rights may not be successful in their efforts and, as a result, we may not receive future royalty or other milestone payments relating to those products or rights.\nIf we are unable to successfully acquire, develop or commercialize new products, our operating results will suffer. Our future results of operations will depend to a significant extent upon our ability to successfully develop and commercialize our technology and businesses in a timely manner. There are numerous difficulties in developing and commercializing new technologies and products, including:\nsuccessfully achieving major developmental steps required to bring the product to a clinical testing stage and clinical testing may not be positive;\ndeveloping, testing and manufacturing products in compliance with regulatory standards in a timely manner;\nthe failure to receive requisite regulatory approvals for such products in a timely manner or at all;\ndeveloping and commercializing a new product is time consuming, costly and subject to numerous factors, including legal actions brought by our competitors, that may delay or prevent the development and commercialization of our product;\nincomplete, unconvincing or equivocal clinical trials data;\nexperiencing delays or unanticipated costs;\nsignificant and unpredictable changes in the payer landscape, coverage and reimbursement for our future product;\nexperiencing delays as a result of limited resources at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") or other regulatory agencies; and\nchanging review and approval policies and standards at the FDA and other regulatory agencies.\nAs a result of these and other difficulties, products in development by us may not receive timely regulatory approvals, or approvals at all, necessary for marketing by us or other third-party partners. If any of our future products are not approved in a timely fashion or, when acquired or developed and approved, cannot be successfully manufactured, commercialized or reimbursed, our operating results could be adversely affected. We cannot guarantee that any investment we make in developing product will be recouped, even if we are successful in commercializing these products.\nOur research and development programs are based on novel technologies and are inherently risky.\nWe are subject to the risks of failure inherent in the development of products based on new technologies. The novel nature of our cell therapy technology creates significant challenges with respect to product development and optimization, manufacturing, government regulation and approval, third-party reimbursement and market acceptance. For example, the FDA and EMA have relatively limited experience with the development and regulation of cell therapy products and, therefore, the pathway to marketing approval for our cell therapy product candidates may accordingly be more complex, lengthy and uncertain than for a more conventional product candidate. The indications of use for which we choose to pursue development may have clinical effectiveness endpoints that have not previously been reviewed or validated by the FDA or EMA, which may complicate or delay our effort to ultimately obtain FDA or EMA approval. Our efforts to overcome these challenges may not prove successful, and any product candidate we seek to develop may not be successfully developed or commercialized.\nExtensive industry regulation has had, and will continue to have, a significant impact on our business, especially our product development, manufacturing and distribution capabilities.\nAll pharmaceutical companies are subject to extensive, complex, costly and evolving government regulation. For the U.S., this is principally administered by the FDA and to a lesser extent by the Drug Enforcement Administration (\"DEA\") and state government agencies, as well as by varying regulatory agencies in foreign countries where products or product candidates are being manufactured and/or marketed. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the Controlled Substances Act and other federal statutes and regulations, and similar foreign statutes and regulations, govern or influence the testing, manufacturing, packing, labeling, storing, record keeping, safety, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution of our future products. Under these regulations, we may become subject to periodic inspection of our facilities, procedures and operations and/or the testing of our future products by the FDA, the DEA and other authorities, which conduct periodic inspections to confirm that we are in compliance with all applicable regulations. In addition, the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies conduct pre-approval and post-approval reviews and plant inspections to determine whether our systems and processes are in compliance with current good manufacturing practice (\"cGMP\") and other regulations. Following such inspections, the FDA or other agency may issue observations, notices, citations and/or warning letters that could cause us to modify certain activities identified during the inspection. FDA guidelines specify that a warning letter is issued only for violations of \"regulatory significance\" for which the failure to adequately and promptly achieve correction may be expected to result in an enforcement action. We may also be required to report adverse events associated with our future products to FDA and other regulatory authorities. Unexpected or serious health or safety concerns would result in labeling changes, recalls, market withdrawals or other regulatory actions.\nThe range of possible sanctions includes, among others, FDA issuance of adverse publicity, product recalls or seizures, fines, total or partial suspension of production and/or distribution, suspension of the FDA's review of product applications, enforcement actions, injunctions, and civil or criminal prosecution. Any such sanctions, if imposed, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows. Under certain circumstances, the FDA also has the authority to revoke previously granted drug approvals. Similar sanctions as detailed above may be available to the FDA under a consent decree, depending upon the actual terms of such decree. If internal compliance programs do not meet regulatory agency standards or if compliance is deemed deficient in any significant way, it could materially harm our business.\nThe European Medicines Agency (\"EMA\") will regulate our future products in Europe. Regulatory approval by the EMA will be subject to the evaluation of data relating to the quality, efficacy and safety of our future products for its proposed use. The time taken to obtain regulatory approval varies between countries. Different regulators may impose their own requirements and may refuse to grant, or may require additional data before granting, an approval, notwithstanding that regulatory approval may have been granted by other regulators.\nRegulatory approval may be delayed, limited or denied for a number of reasons, including insufficient clinical data, the product not meeting safety or efficacy requirements or any relevant manufacturing processes or facilities not meeting applicable requirements.\nFurther trials and other costly and time-consuming assessments of the product may be required to obtain or maintain regulatory approval. Medicinal products are generally subject to lengthy and rigorous pre-clinical and clinical trials and other extensive, costly and time-consuming procedures mandated by regulatory authorities. We may be required to conduct additional trials beyond those currently planned, which could require significant time and expense. In addition, even after the technology approval, both in the U.S. and Europe, we will be required to maintain post marketing surveillance of potential adverse and risk assessment programs to identify adverse events that did not appear during the clinical studies and drug approval process. All of the foregoing could require an investment of significant time and expense.\nWe have never generated any revenue from therapeutic product sales and our ability to generate revenue from product sales and become profitable depends significantly on our success in a number of factors.\nWe have no therapeutic products approved for commercial sale, have not generated any revenue from product sales, and do not anticipate generating any revenue from product sales until sometime after we have received regulatory approval for the commercial sale of a product candidate. Our ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability depends significantly on our success in many factors, including:\ncompleting research regarding, and nonclinical and clinical development of, our product candidates;\nobtaining regulatory approvals and marketing authorizations for product candidates for which we complete clinical studies;\ndeveloping a sustainable and scalable manufacturing process for our product candidates, including establishing and maintaining commercially viable supply relationships with third parties and establishing our own manufacturing capabilities and infrastructure;\nlaunching and commercializing product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approvals and marketing authorizations, either directly or with a collaborator or distributor;\nobtaining market acceptance of our product candidates as viable treatment options;\naddressing any competing technological and market developments;\nidentifying, assessing, acquiring and/or developing new product candidates;\nnegotiating favorable terms in any collaboration, licensing, or other arrangements into which we may enter;\nmaintaining, protecting, and expanding our portfolio of intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets, and know-how; and\nattracting, hiring, and retaining qualified personnel.\nEven if one or more of the product candidates that we develop is approved for commercial sale, we anticipate incurring significant costs associated with commercializing any approved product candidate. Our expenses could increase beyond expectations if we are required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, or other regulatory agencies, domestic or foreign, to change our manufacturing processes or assays, or to perform clinical, nonclinical, or other types of studies in addition to those that we currently anticipate. If we are successful in obtaining regulatory approvals to market one or more of our product candidates, our revenue will be dependent, in part, upon the size of the markets in the territories for which we gain regulatory approval, the accepted price for the product, the ability to get reimbursement at any price, and whether we own the commercial rights for that territory. If the number of our addressable disease patients is not as significant as we estimate, the indication approved by regulatory authorities is narrower than we expect, or the reasonably accepted population for treatment is narrowed by competition, physician choice or treatment guidelines, we may not generate significant revenue from sales of such products, even if approved. If we are not able to generate revenue from the sale of any approved products, we may never become profitable.\nWe have concentrated our research and development efforts on technology using cell-based therapy, and our future success is highly dependent on the successful development of that technology for diabetes.\nWe have developed a technology that demonstrates the capacity to induce a shift in the developmental fate of cells from the liver and differentiating (converting) them into \"pancreatic beta cell-like\" insulin-producing cells for patients with diabetes. Based on licensed know-how and patents, our intention is to develop our technology to the clinical stage for regeneration of functional insulin-producing cells, thus enabling normal glucose regulated insulin secretion, via cell therapy. By using therapeutic agents (i.e., PDX-1, and additional pancreatic transcription factors in an adenovirus-vector) that efficiently convert a sub-population of liver cells into pancreatic islets phenotype and function, this approach allows the diabetic patient to be the donor of his/her own therapeutic tissue and to start producing his/her own insulin in a glucose-responsive manner, thereby eliminating the need for insulin injections. Because this is a new approach to treating diabetes, developing and commercializing our product candidates subjects us to a number of challenges, including:\nobtaining regulatory approval from the FDA, EMA and other regulatory authorities that have very limited experience with the commercial development of our technology for diabetes;\ndeveloping and deploying consistent and reliable processes for engineering a patient's liver cells ex vivo and infusing the engineered cells back into the patient;\ndeveloping processes for the safe administration of these products, including long-term follow-up for all patients who receive our products;\nsourcing clinical and, if approved, commercial supplies for the materials used to manufacture and process our products;\ndeveloping a manufacturing process and distribution network with a cost of goods that allows for an attractive return on investment;\nestablishing sales and marketing capabilities after obtaining any regulatory approval to gain market acceptance; and\nmaintaining a system of post marketing surveillance and risk assessment programs to identify adverse events that did not appear during the drug approval process\nWhen we commence our clinical trials, we may not be able to conduct our trials on the timelines we expect.\nClinical testing is expensive, time consuming, and subject to uncertainty. We cannot guarantee that any clinical studies will be conducted as planned or completed on schedule, if at all. We expect that our early clinical work will help support the filing with the FDA of an IND for our product in fiscal 2020. However, we cannot be sure that we will be able to submit an IND in this time-frame, and we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin. Moreover, even if these trials begin, issues may arise that could suspend or terminate such clinical trials. A failure of one or more clinical studies can occur at any stage of testing, and our future clinical studies may not be successful. Events that may prevent successful or timely completion of clinical development include:\nthe inability to generate sufficient preclinical or other in vivo or in vitro data to support the initiation of clinical studies;\ndelays in reaching a consensus with regulatory agencies on study design;\ndelays in establishing CMC (Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls) which is a cornerstone in clinical study submission and later on, the regulatory approval;\nthe FDA not allowing us to use the clinical trial data from a research institution to support an IND if we cannot demonstrate the comparability of our product candidates with the product candidate used by the relevant research institution in its clinical studies;\ndelays in obtaining required Institutional Review Board, or IRB, approval at each clinical study site;\nimposition of a temporary or permanent clinical hold by regulatory agencies for a number of reasons, including after review of an IND application or amendment, or equivalent application or amendment;\na result of a new safety finding that presents unreasonable risk to clinical trial participants;\na negative finding from an inspection of our clinical study operations or study sites;\ndevelopments on trials conducted by competitors for related technology that raises FDA concerns about risk to patients of the technology broadly;\nif FDA finds that the investigational protocol or plan is clearly deficient to meet its stated objectives;\ndelays in recruiting suitable patients to participate in our clinical studies;\ndifficulty collaborating with patient groups and investigators;\nfailure to perform in accordance with the FDA's current good clinical practices, or cGCPs, requirements, or applicable regulatory guidelines in other countries;\ndelays in having patients' complete participation in a study or return for post-treatment follow-up;\npatients dropping out of a study;\noccurrence of adverse events associated with the product candidate that are viewed to outweigh its potential benefits;\nchanges in regulatory requirements and guidance that require amending or submitting new clinical protocols;\nchanges in the standard of care on which a clinical development plan was based, which may require new or additional trials;\nthe cost of clinical studies of our product candidates being greater than we anticipate;\nclinical studies of our product candidates producing negative or inconclusive results, which may result in our deciding, or regulators requiring us, to conduct additional clinical studies or abandon product development programs; and\ndelays in manufacturing, testing, releasing, validating, or importing/exporting sufficient stable quantities of our product candidates for use in clinical studies or the inability to do any of the foregoing.\nAny inability to successfully complete preclinical and clinical development could result in additional costs to us or impair our ability to generate revenue. In addition, if we make manufacturing or formulation changes to our product candidates, we may be required to, or we may elect to conduct additional studies to bridge our modified product candidates to earlier versions. Clinical study delays could also shorten any periods during which our products have patent protection and may allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do, which could impair our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates and may harm our business and results of operations.\nOur clinical trial results may also not support approval, whether accelerated approval, conditional marketing authorizations, or regular approval. The results of preclinical and clinical studies may not be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical trials, and product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy despite having progressed through preclinical studies and initial clinical trials. In addition, our product candidates could fail to receive regulatory approval for many reasons, including the following:\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with the design or implementation of our clinical trials;\nthe population studied in the clinical program may not be sufficiently broad or representative to assure safety in the full population for which we seek approval;\nwe may be unable to demonstrate that our product candidates' risk-benefit ratios for their proposed indications are acceptable;\nthe results of clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities for approval;\nwe may be unable to demonstrate that the clinical and other benefits of our product candidates outweigh their safety risks;\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with our interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials;\nthe data collected from clinical trials of our product candidates may not be sufficient to the satisfaction of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities to obtain regulatory approval in the United States or elsewhere;\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may fail to approve the manufacturing processes, our own manufacturing facilities, or our third-party manufacturers' facilities with which we contract for clinical and commercial supplies; and\nthe approval policies or regulations of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may significantly change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval.\nFurther, failure to obtain approval for any of the above reasons may be made more likely by the fact that the FDA and other regulatory authorities have very limited experience with commercial development of our cell therapy for the treatment of Type 1 Diabetes.\nOur product candidates may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could halt their clinical development, prevent their regulatory approval, limit their commercial potential, or result in significant negative consequences.\nAs with most biological drug products, use of our product candidates could be associated with side effects or adverse events which can vary in severity from minor reactions to death and in frequency from infrequent to prevalent. Any of these occurrences may materially and adversely harm our business, financial condition and prospects.\nResearch and development of biopharmaceutical products is inherently risky.\nWe may not be successful in our efforts to use and enhance our technology platform to create a pipeline of product candidates and develop commercially successful products. Furthermore, we may expend our limited resources on programs that do not yield a successful product candidate and fail to capitalize on product candidates or diseases that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success. If we fail to develop additional product candidates, our commercial opportunity will be limited. Even if we are successful in continuing to build our pipeline, obtaining regulatory approvals and commercializing additional product candidates will require substantial additional funding and are prone to the risks of failure inherent in medical product development. Investment in biopharmaceutical product development involves significant risk that any potential product candidate will fail to demonstrate adequate efficacy or an acceptable safety profile, gain regulatory approval, and become commercially viable. We cannot provide you any assurance that we will be able to successfully advance any of these additional product candidates through the development process. Our research programs may initially show promise in identifying potential product candidates, yet fail to yield product candidates for clinical development or commercialization for many reasons, including the following:\nour platform may not be successful in identifying additional product candidates;\nwe may not be able or willing to assemble sufficient resources to acquire or discover additional product candidates;\nour product candidates may not succeed in preclinical or clinical testing;\na product candidate may on further study be shown to have harmful side effects or other characteristics that indicate it is unlikely to be effective or otherwise does not meet applicable regulatory criteria;\ncompetitors may develop alternatives that render our product candidates obsolete or less attractive;\nproduct candidates we develop may nevertheless be covered by third parties' patents or other exclusive rights;\nthe market for a product candidate may change during our program so that the continued development of that product candidate is no longer reasonable;\na product candidate may not be capable of being produced in commercial quantities at an acceptable cost, or at all; and\na product candidate may not be accepted as safe and effective by patients, the medical community or third- party payers, if applicable.\nIf any of these events occur, we may be forced to abandon our development efforts for a program or programs, or we may not be able to identify, discover, develop, or commercialize additional product candidates, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and could potentially cause us to cease operations.\nOur product candidates are biologics and the manufacture of our product candidates is complex and we may encounter difficulties in production, particularly with respect to process development or scaling-out of our manufacturing capabilities.\nIf we encounter such difficulties, our ability to provide supply of our product candidates for clinical trials or our products for patients, if approved, could be delayed or stopped, or we may be unable to maintain a commercially viable cost structure. Our product candidates are biologics and the process of manufacturing our products is complex, highly regulated and subject to multiple risks. The manufacture of our product candidates involves complex processes, including the biopsy of tissue from a patient's liver, propagation of the patient's liver cells from that liver tissue to obtain the desired dose, trans-differentiating those cells into insulin-producing cells ex vivo and ultimately infusing the cells back into a patient's body. As a result of the complexities, the cost to manufacture biologics is generally higher than traditional small molecule chemical compounds, and the manufacturing process is less reliable and is more difficult to reproduce.\nOur manufacturing process will be susceptible to product loss or failure due to logistical issues associated with the collection of liver cells, or starting material, from the patient, shipping such material to the manufacturing site, shipping the final product back to the patient, and infusing the patient with the product, manufacturing issues associated with the differences in patient starting materials, interruptions in the manufacturing process, contamination, equipment or reagent failure, improper installation or operation of equipment, vendor or operator error, inconsistency in cell growth, failures in process testing and variability in product characteristics. Even minor deviations from normal manufacturing processes could result in reduced production yields, product defects, and other supply disruptions. If for any reason we lose a patient's starting material or later-developed product at any point in the process, the manufacturing process for that patient will need to be restarted and the resulting delay may adversely affect that patient's outcome. If microbial, viral, or other contaminations are discovered in our product candidates or in the manufacturing facilities in which our product candidates are made, such manufacturing facilities may need to be closed for an extended period of time to investigate and remedy the contamination. Because our product candidates are manufactured for each particular patient, we will be required to maintain a chain of identity and tractability of all reagents and viruses involved in the process with respect to materials as they move from the patient to the manufacturing facility, through the manufacturing process, and back to the patient. Maintaining such a chain of identity is difficult and complex, and failure to do so could result in adverse patient outcomes, loss of product, or regulatory action including withdrawal of our products from the market. Further, as product candidates are developed through preclinical to late stage clinical trials towards approval and commercialization, it is common that various aspects of the development program, such as manufacturing methods, are altered along the way in an effort to optimize processes and results. Such changes carry the risk that they will not achieve these intended objectives, and any of these changes could cause our product candidates to perform differently and affect the results of planned clinical trials or other future clinical trials.\nAlthough we are working to develop commercially viable processes, doing so is a difficult and uncertain task, and there are risks associated with scaling to the level required for advanced clinical trials or commercialization, including, among others, cost overruns, potential problems with process scale-out, process reproducibility, stability issues, lot consistency, and timely availability of reagents or raw materials. We may ultimately be unable to reduce the cost of goods for our product candidates to levels that will allow for an attractive return on investment if and when those product candidates are commercialized.\nIn addition, the manufacturing process for any products that we may develop is subject to FDA and foreign regulatory authority approval process, and we will need to contract with manufacturers who can meet all applicable FDA and foreign regulatory authority requirements on an ongoing basis. If we are unable to reliably produce products to specifications acceptable to the FDA or other regulatory authorities, we may not obtain or maintain the approvals we need to commercialize such products. Even if we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, there is no assurance that either we or our subsidiaries and joint ventures will be able to manufacture the approved product to specifications acceptable to the FDA or other regulatory authorities, to produce it in sufficient quantities to meet the requirements for the potential launch of the product, or to meet potential future demand. Any of these challenges could delay completion of clinical trials, require bridging clinical trials or the repetition of one or more clinical trials, increase clinical trial costs, delay approval of our product candidate, impair commercialization efforts, increase our cost of goods, and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nThe manufacture of biological drug products is complex and requires significant expertise and capital investment, including the development of advanced manufacturing techniques and process controls. Manufacturers of biologic products often encounter difficulties in production, particularly in scaling up or out, validating the production process, and assuring high reliability of the manufacturing process (including the absence of contamination). These problems include logistics and shipping, difficulties with production costs and yields, quality control, including stability of the product, product testing, operator error, availability of qualified personnel, as well as compliance with strictly enforced federal, state and foreign regulations. Furthermore, if contaminants are discovered in our supply of our product candidates or in the manufacturing facilities, such manufacturing facilities may need to be closed for an extended period of time to investigate and remedy the contamination. We cannot assure you that any stability failures or other issues relating to the manufacture of our product candidates will not occur in the future. Additionally, our manufacturers may experience manufacturing difficulties due to resource constraints or as a result of labor disputes or unstable political environments. If our manufacturers were to encounter any of these difficulties, or otherwise fail to comply with their contractual obligations, our ability to provide our product candidate to patients in clinical trials would be jeopardized. Any delay or interruption in the supply of clinical trial supplies could delay the completion of clinical trials, increase the costs associated with maintaining clinical trial programs and, depending upon the period of delay, require us to begin new clinical trials at additional expense or terminate clinical trials completely.\nCell-based therapies rely on the availability of reagents, specialized equipment, and other specialty materials, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. For some of these reagents, equipment, and materials, we rely or may rely on sole source vendors or a limited number of vendors, which could impair our ability to manufacture and supply our products.\nManufacturing our product candidates will require many reagents and viruses, which are substances used in our manufacturing processes to bring about chemical or biological reactions, and other specialty materials and equipment, some of which are manufactured or supplied by small companies with limited resources and experience to support commercial biologics production. We currently depend on a limited number of vendors for certain materials and equipment used in the manufacture of our product candidates. Some of these suppliers may not have the capacity to support commercial products manufactured under GMP by biopharmaceutical firms or may otherwise be ill-equipped to support our needs. We also do not have supply contracts with many of these suppliers and may not be able to obtain supply contracts with them on acceptable terms or at all. Accordingly, we may experience delays in receiving key materials and equipment to support clinical or commercial manufacturing.\nFor some of these reagents, viruses, equipment, and materials, we rely and may in the future rely on sole source vendors or a limited number of vendors. An inability to continue to source product from any of these suppliers, which could be due to regulatory actions or requirements affecting the supplier, adverse financial or other strategic developments experienced by a supplier, labor disputes or shortages, unexpected demands, or quality issues, could adversely affect our ability to satisfy demand for our product candidates, which could adversely and materially affect our product sales and operating results or our ability to conduct clinical trials, either of which could significantly harm our business.\nAs we continue to develop and scale our manufacturing process, we expect that we will need to obtain rights to and supplies of certain materials and equipment to be used as part of that process. We may not be able to obtain rights to such materials on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, and if we are unable to alter our process in a commercially viable manner to avoid the use of such materials or find a suitable substitute, it would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe currently have no marketing and sales organization and have no experience in marketing therapeutic products. If we are unable to establish marketing and sales capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell our product candidates, we may not be able to generate product revenue.\nWe currently have no sales, marketing, or commercial therapeutic product distribution capabilities and have no experience in marketing products. We intend to develop an in-house marketing organization and sales force, which will require significant capital expenditures, management resources, and time. We will have to compete with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to recruit, hire, train, and retain marketing and sales personnel. If we are unable to or decide not to establish internal sales, marketing and commercial distribution capabilities for any or all products we develop, we will likely pursue collaborative arrangements regarding the sales and marketing of our products. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to establish or maintain such collaborative arrangements, or if we are able to do so, that they will have effective sales forces. Any revenue we receive will depend upon the efforts of such third parties, which may not be successful. We may have little or no control over the marketing and sales efforts of such third parties, and our revenue from product sales may be lower than if we had commercialized our product candidates ourselves. We also face competition in our search for third parties to assist us with the sales and marketing efforts of our product candidates.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to develop in-house sales and commercial distribution capabilities or establish or maintain relationships with third-party collaborators to successfully commercialize any product in the United States or overseas, and as a result, we may not be able to generate product revenue.\nA variety of risks associated with operating our business internationally could materially adversely affect our business. We plan to seek regulatory approval of our product candidates outside of the United States and, accordingly, we expect that we, and any potential collaborators in those jurisdictions, will be subject to additional risks related to operating in foreign countries, including:\ndiffering regulatory requirements in foreign countries, unexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers, price and exchange controls, and other regulatory requirements;\neconomic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets;\ncompliance with tax, employment, immigration, and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad;\nforeign taxes, including withholding of payroll taxes;\nforeign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenue, and other obligations incident to doing business in another country;\ndifficulties staffing and managing foreign operations;\nworkforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States;\npotential liability under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 or comparable foreign laws;\nchallenges enforcing our contractual and intellectual property rights, especially in those foreign countries that do not respect and protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the United States;\nproduction shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad; and\nbusiness interruptions resulting from geo-political actions, including war and terrorism.\nThese and other risks associated with our planned international operations may materially adversely affect our ability to attain or maintain profitable operations.\nWe face significant competition from other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, and our operating results will suffer if we fail to compete effectively.\nThe biopharmaceutical industry, and the rapidly evolving market for developing cell-based therapies is characterized by intense competition and rapid innovation. Our competitors may be able to develop other compounds or drugs that are able to achieve similar or better results. Our potential competitors include major multinational pharmaceutical companies, established biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, universities, and other research institutions. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources, such as larger research and development staff and experienced marketing and manufacturing organizations as well as established sales forces. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large, established companies. Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated in our competitors. Competition may increase further as a result of advances in the commercial applicability of technologies and greater availability of capital for investment in these industries. Our competitors, either alone or with collaborative partners, may succeed in developing, acquiring or licensing on an exclusive basis drug or biologic products that are more effective, safer, more easily commercialized, or less costly than our product candidates or may develop proprietary technologies or secure patent protection that we may need for the development of our technologies and products.\nSpecifically, we face significant competition from companies in the insulin therapy market. Insulin therapy is widely used for Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus (IDDM) patients who are not controlled with oral medications. The global diabetes market comprising the insulin, insulin analogues and other anti-diabetic drugs has been evolving rapidly. A look at the diabetes market reveals that it is dominated by a handful of participants such as Novo Nordisk A/S, Eli Lilly and Company, Sanofi-Aventis, Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, Pfizer Inc., Merck KgaA, and Bayer AG. Even if we obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates, we may not be the first to market and that may affect the price or demand for our product candidates. Additionally, the availability and price of our competitors' products could limit the demand and the price we are able to charge for our product candidates. We may not be able to implement our business plan if the acceptance of our product candidates is inhibited by price competition or the reluctance of physicians to switch from existing methods of treatment to our product candidates, or if physicians switch to other new drug or biologic products or choose to reserve our product candidates for use in limited circumstances. Additionally, a competitor could obtain orphan product exclusivity from the FDA with respect to such competitor's product. If such competitor product is determined to be the same product as one of our product candidates, that may prevent us from obtaining approval from the FDA for such product candidate for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances.\nWe are highly dependent on our key personnel, and if we are not successful in attracting, motivating and retaining highly qualified personnel, we may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy.\nOur ability to compete in the highly competitive biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries depends upon our ability to attract, motivate and retain highly qualified managerial, scientific and medical personnel. We are highly dependent on our senior management, particularly our Chief Scientific Officer, Prof. Sarah Ferber, and our Chief Executive Officer, Vered Caplan. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers, other key employees, and other scientific and medical advisors, and our inability to find suitable replacements, could result in delays in product development and harm our business. Competition for skilled personnel is intense and the turnover rate can be high, which may limit our ability to hire and retain highly qualified personnel on acceptable terms or at all.\nTo induce valuable employees to remain at our company, in addition to salary and cash incentives, we have provided stock option grants that vest over time. The value to employees of these equity grants that vest over time may be significantly affected by movements in our stock price that are beyond our control and may at any time be insufficient to counteract more lucrative offers from other companies. Although we have employment agreements with our key employees, most these employment agreements provide for at-will employment, which means that any of our employees could leave our employment at any time, with or without notice. We do not maintain \"key man\" insurance policies on the lives of all of these individuals or the lives of any of our other employees.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nIf we issue additional shares in the future, it will result in the dilution of our existing stockholders.\nOur articles of incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to 145,833,334 shares of our common stock with a par value of $0.0001 per share. Our Board of Directors may choose to issue some or all of such shares to acquire one or more companies or products and to fund our overhead and general operating requirements. The issuance of any such shares will reduce the book value per share and may contribute to a reduction in the market price of the outstanding shares of our common stock. If we issue any such additional shares, such issuance will reduce the proportionate ownership and voting power of all current stockholders. Further, such issuance may result in a change of control of our company.\nOur stock price and trading volume may be volatile, which could result in losses for our stockholders.\nThe equity trading markets have recently experienced high volatility resulting in highly variable and unpredictable pricing of equity securities. If the turmoil in the equity trading markets continues, the market for our common stock could change in ways that may not be related to our business, our industry or our operating performance and financial condition. In addition, the trading volume in our common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. Some of the factors that could negatively affect our share price or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our common stock include:\nactual or anticipated quarterly variations in our operating results;\nchanges in expectations as to our future financial performance or changes in financial estimates, if any;\nannouncements relating to our business;\nconditions generally affecting the biotechnology industry;\nthe success of our operating strategy; and\nthe operating and stock performance of other comparable companies.\nMany of these factors are beyond our control, and we cannot predict their potential effects on the price of our common stock. In addition, the stock market is subject to extreme price and volume fluctuations. During the past 52 weeks ended December 31, 2019, our stock price has fluctuated from a low of $2.60 to a high of $5.60. This volatility has had a significant effect on the market price of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their operating performance and could have the same effect on our common stock.\nNo assurance can be provided that a purchaser of our common stock will be able to resell their shares of common stock at or above the price that they acquired those shares. We can provide no assurances that the market price of common stock will increase or that the market price of common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on any investment in the shares of stock of our company.\nWe have never paid any cash dividends, and currently do not intend to pay any dividends for the foreseeable future. The Board of Directors has not directed the payment of any dividends and does not anticipate paying dividends on the shares for the foreseeable future and intends to retain any future earnings to the extent necessary to develop and expand our business. Payment of cash dividends, if any, will depend, among other factors, on our earnings, capital requirements, and the general operating and financial condition, and will be subject to legal limitations on the payment of dividends out of paid-in capital. Because we do not intend to declare dividends, any gain on an investment in our company will need to come through an increase in the stock's price. This may never happen, and investors may lose all of their investment in our company.", "PERMNO": 17370, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "ORGS"}
