RISK FACTORS\nOwnership of our common stock involves certain risks. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. You should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as all other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of these risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations could be materially, adversely affected.\nGENERAL ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS RISKS\nThe outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has caused a significant global economic downturn which has adversely affected our business and results of operations, and the future impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy and our business, results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition remain uncertain.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to cause economic disruption both worldwide and in the markets we operate. Given the ongoing and dynamic nature of these circumstances, it is difficult to predict the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on our business, and there is no guarantee that our efforts to address or mitigate the adverse impacts of the coronavirus will be effective. To date, the impact has included periods of significant volatility in financial, commodities, and other markets. This volatility, if it continues, could have an adverse impact on our customers and on our business, financial condition, and results of operations, as well as our growth strategy.\nOur business is dependent upon the willingness and ability of our customers to conduct financial transactions and fulfill their obligations. The spread of COVID-19 has caused (and could continue to cause) severe disruptions in the U.S. economy, and has resulted (and may continue to result) in disruptions to our customers\u2019 businesses, and a decrease in consumer confidence, and adversely affect business generally. In addition, actions by US federal, state, and local governments to address the pandemic, including travel bans, stay-at-home orders, and school, business, and entertainment venue closures, have had (and may continue to have) a significant adverse effect on our customers and the markets in which we conduct our business. The extent of impacts resulting from the pandemic and other events beyond our control remain dependent on future developments, including but not limited to the effectiveness and level of acceptance of vaccines, new information that may emerge concerning the severity of the pandemic, the duration of the coronavirus pandemic, any resurgence in the number of COVID-19 cases, any development and proliferation of new strains of COVID-19, actions taken to contain the coronavirus or its impact, and other similar factors; all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nAlthough new loan originations began to rebound during the latter part of 2020, we believe economic impacts stemming from COVID-19 will continue to influence our loan originations in the near term, both in terms of both a reduction in overall demand for new loans and our continued emphasis on prudent credit risk management, particularly within the context of the continued uncertainty surrounding the economic environment.\nDisruptions to our customers or business in general could result in increased risk of delinquencies, defaults, foreclosures, and losses on our loans. The escalation of the pandemic may also negatively impact regional economic conditions for a period of time, which could result in declines in loan demand, liquidity of loan guarantors, loan collateral (particularly in real estate), loan originations, and deposit availability. If the global response to contain COVID-19 escalates or is unsuccessful, we could experience a material adverse situation that could affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe economic environment could pose significant challenges for the Company and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur financial condition and results of operations are dependent on the U.S. economy, generally, and markets we serve, specifically. We primarily serve markets in California, and major metropolitan areas in Washington, Oregon, Arizona, and Nevada, though certain of our products and services are offered nationwide. Financial stress on our customers as a result of an uncertain future economic environment could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s customers and their ability to repay their loans, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations. A weakening of these conditions in the markets in which we operate would likely have an adverse effect on us and others in the financial institutions industry. For example, a deterioration in economic conditions in our markets could drive losses beyond that which is provided for in our allowance for credit losses. We may also face the following risks in connection with these events:\n\u2022economic conditions that negatively affect real estate values and the job market may result in the deterioration of the credit quality of our loan portfolio, and such deterioration in credit quality could have a negative impact on our business;\n\u2022a decrease in the demand for loans and other products and services offered by us;\n\u2022a decrease in deposit balances, including low-cost and non-interest bearing deposits;\n\u2022a decrease in the value of our loans or other assets secured by collateral such as commercial or residential real estate;\n\u2022a decrease in net interest income derived from our lending and deposit gathering activities;\n\u2022a decrease in consumer confidence levels and adverse changes in payment patterns, causing increases in delinquencies and default rates on loans and other credit facilities;\n\u2022the processes we use to estimate our allowance for credit losses (\u201cACL\u201d) under the CECL methodology requires the use of complex judgments, including forecasts of economic conditions, which are difficult to estimate, and adverse economic conditions or expected economic conditions may require us to provide for a significantly greater ACL; and\n\u2022our ability to assess the creditworthiness of our customers may be impaired if the methodologies and approaches we use become less effective in controlling charge-offs.\nAs these conditions or similar ones exist or worsen, we could experience adverse effects on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAdverse economic conditions in California, Washington, Oregon, Arizona, or Nevada, may cause us to suffer higher default rates on our loans and reduce the value of the assets we hold as collateral.\nOur business activities and credit exposure are concentrated in California, and to a lesser extent Washington, Oregon, Arizona, and Nevada. Difficult economic conditions in these markets may cause us to incur losses associated with higher default rates and decreased collateral values in our loan portfolio. In addition, demand for our products and services may decline. Declines in the California real estate market could hurt our business, because the majority of our loans are secured by real estate located within California. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 61% of the aggregate outstanding principal of our loans was secured by real estate were located in California. If real estate values were to decline in California, the collateral for our loans would provide less security. As a result, our ability to recover on defaulted loans by selling the underlying real estate would be diminished, and we would be more likely to suffer losses on defaulted loans.\nMARKET RISKS\nInterest rate changes, which are beyond our control, could harm our profitability.\nOur profitability depends to a large extent upon net interest income, which is the difference between interest income and dividends we earn on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investments, and interest expense we pay on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Any change in general market interest rates, whether as a result of changes in the monetary policy of the Federal Reserve or otherwise, may have a significant effect on net interest income and prepayments on our loans. Since March 2020, the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s Open Market Committee has maintained its federal funds rate target in a range of 0% to 0.25%.\nOur assets and liabilities may react differently to changes in overall interest rates or conditions. In general, higher interest rates are associated with a lower volume of loan originations while lower interest rates are usually associated with higher loan originations. Further, if interest rates decline, our loans may be refinanced at lower rates or paid off and our investments may be prepaid earlier than expected. If that occurs, we may have to redeploy the loan or investment proceeds into lower yielding assets, which might also decrease our income. Also, as many of our loans currently have interest rate floors, a rise in rates may increase the cost of our deposits while the rates on the loans remain at their floors, which could decrease our net interest income. Accordingly, changes in levels of market interest rates could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, loan origination volumes, net interest margin, results of operations, and profitability. Changes in interest rates also have a significant impact on the carrying value of certain of our assets, including loans, real estate, and investment securities, on our balance sheet.\nWe may incur debt in the future and that debt may also be sensitive to interest rates. Further, federal monetary policy significantly affects credit conditions for us, as well as for our borrowers, particularly as implemented by the Federal Reserve, primarily through open market operations in U.S. government securities, the federal funds rate target, the discount rate for bank borrowings, and reserve requirements. A material change in any of these conditions could have a material impact on us or our customers (including borrowers), and therefore on our results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s sensitivity to changes in interest rates is low in a rising interest rate environment based on the current profile of the Company\u2019s loan portfolio and low-cost and no-cost deposits. See \u201cItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\u201d At December 31, 2020, we had $2.91 billion in interest-bearing demand deposits. In addition, at December 31, 2020, we had $5.66 billion in money market and savings deposits. If the interest rates on our loans increase comparably faster than the interest rate on our interest-bearing demand deposits, money market, and savings deposits, our core deposit balances may decrease as customers use those funds to repay higher cost loans. In addition, if we need to offer additional interest-bearing demand deposit products or higher interest rates on our current interest-bearing demand, money market, or savings deposit accounts in order to maintain current customers or attract new customers, our interest expense will increase, perhaps materially. Furthermore, if we fail to offer competitive rates sufficient to retain these accounts, our core deposits may be reduced, which would require us to seek alternative funding sources or risk slowing our future asset growth. In these circumstances, our net interest income may decrease, which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nAs interest rates rise, our existing customers who have adjustable rate loans may see their loan payments increase and, as a result, may experience difficulty repaying those loans, which in turn could lead to higher losses for us. Increasing delinquencies, non-accrual loans, and defaults lead to higher loan loss provisions, and potentially greater eventual losses that would lower our current profitability and capital ratios.\nChanges in the fair value of our investment securities may reduce our stockholders\u2019 equity and net income.\nAt December 31, 2020, $3.93 billion of our securities were classified as available-for-sale with an aggregate net unrealized gain of $84.4 million. We increase or decrease stockholders\u2019 equity by the amount of change from the unrealized gain or loss (the difference between the estimated fair value and the amortized cost) of our available-for-sale securities portfolio, net of the related tax, under the category of accumulated other comprehensive income/loss. Therefore, a decline in the estimated fair value of this portfolio will result in a decline in reported stockholders\u2019 equity, as well as book value per common share and tangible book value per common share. This decrease will occur even though the securities are not sold. In the case of debt securities, if these securities are never sold and there are no credit impairments, the decrease will be recovered over the life of the securities. In the case of equity securities, which have no stated maturity, the declines in fair value may or may not be recovered over time.\nAt December 31, 2020, we had stock holdings in the FHLB of San Francisco totaling $17.3 million, $74.4 million in FRB stock, and $25.4 million in other stock, all carried at cost. The stock held by us is subject to recoverability testing under applicable accounting standards. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we did not recognize an impairment charge related to our stock holdings. There can be no assurance that future negative changes to the financial condition of the issuers may require us to recognize an impairment charge with respect to such stock holdings.\nWe may be adversely impacted by the transition from LIBOR as a reference rate.\nIn 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority announced that after 2021 it will no longer compel banks to submit the rates required to calculate LIBOR. In November 2020, the administrator of LIBOR announced it will consult on its intention to extend the retirement date of certain offered rates whereby the publication of the one week and two month LIBOR offered rates will cease after December 31, 2021; but, the publication of the remaining LIBOR offered rates will continue until June 30, 2023. Given consumer protection, litigation, and reputation risks, the bank regulatory agencies have indicated that entering into new contracts that use LIBOR as a reference rate after December 31, 2021 would create safety and soundness risks and that they will examine bank practices accordingly. Therefore, the agencies encouraged banks to cease entering into new contracts that use LIBOR as a reference rate as soon as practicable and in any event by December 31, 2021.\nThere is uncertainty as to what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, or what the effect of any such changes in views or alternatives may be on the markets for LIBOR-indexed financial instruments. In response, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (\u201cARRC\u201d) was convened in the U.S. to explore alternative reference rates and supporting processes. The ARRC identified a potential successor rate to LIBOR in the SOFR and crafted the Paced Transition Plan to facilitate the transition. However, there are conceptual and technical differences between LIBOR and SOFR that remain unresolved at this time.\nWe have a significant number of loans, some securities and borrowings, and some deposit products with attributes that are either directly or indirectly dependent on LIBOR. We have not yet determined the optimal reference rate(s) that we will ultimately use for our financial instruments going forward. We have organized a multidisciplinary project team to identify operational and contractual best practices, assess our risks, identify the detailed list of all financial instruments impacted, manage the transition, facilitate communication with our customers and counterparties, and monitor the impacts. We drafted and began including fallback language in our loan agreements beginning in 2018.\nThe transition from LIBOR could create considerable costs and additional risk. The uncertainty as to the nature and effect of the discontinuance of LIBOR may adversely affect the value of, the return on or the expenses associated with our financial assets and liabilities that are based on or are linked to LIBOR, may require extensive changes to the contracts that govern these LIBOR-based products as well as our systems and processes, and could impact our pricing and interest rate risk models, our loan product structures, our funding costs, our valuation tools and result in increased compliance and operational costs. In addition, the market transition away from LIBOR to an alternative reference rate could prompt inquiries or other actions from regulators in respect of our preparation and readiness for the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate, and result in disputes, litigation or other actions with counterparties regarding the interpretation and enforceability of certain fallback language in LIBOR-based financial instruments. Furthermore, failure to adequately manage this transition process with our customers could adversely impact our reputation.\nAlthough we are currently unable to assess the ultimate impact of the transition from LIBOR, the failure to adequately manage the transition could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCREDIT RISKS\nWe may suffer losses in our loan portfolio in excess of losses previously estimated.\nOur total nonperforming assets amounted to $29.2 million, or 0.15% of our total assets, at December 31, 2020, an increase from $9.0 million or 0.08% at December 31, 2019. We had $16.9 million of net loan charge-offs for 2020, an increase from $7.5 million in 2019. Our provision for credit losses on loans was $172.3 million in 2020, an increase from $7.1 million in 2019. If increases in our nonperforming assets occur in the future, our net loan charge-offs and/or provision for credit losses may also increase, which may have an adverse effect upon our future results of operations and capital.\nWe seek to mitigate the risks inherent in our loan portfolio by adhering to specific underwriting practices. These practices generally include analysis of a borrower\u2019s available cash flow (determined using financial statements and tax returns) and cash flow projections, valuation of collateral based on reports of independent appraisers, prior credit history, and liquid asset verifications. Although we believe that our underwriting criteria are appropriate for the various kinds of loans we make, we may incur losses on loans that meet our underwriting criteria but subsequently deteriorate, and these losses may exceed the amounts set aside as reserves in our ACL under the CECL methodology (and ALLL prior to January 1, 2020).\nOn January 1, 2020, we changed the way we estimate credit losses by replacing the incurred loss model used to determine the allowance for loan losses, or ALLL, with the current expected credit losses, or CECL, model. The CECL model incorporates the use of and is more reliant on reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions, including, but not limited to: forecasts of GDP growth rates, levels of unemployment, vacancy rates, and changes in the value of commercial real estate properties.\nAlthough we maintain an ACL at a level that we believe is adequate to absorb future expected credit losses under the CECL model, changes in economic, operating, and other conditions, including a sharp decline in real estate values and changes in interest rates, which are beyond our control, may cause our actual loan losses to exceed our current allowance estimates, which will adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, the Federal Reserve and the DFPI, as part of their supervisory function, periodically review our credit loss reserves. Either agency may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or to recognize further loan losses, based on their judgments, which may be different from those of our management and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur level of credit risk could increase due to our focus on commercial lending and the concentration on small and middle market business customers, who can have heightened vulnerability to economic conditions.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our commercial real estate loans amounted to $10.77 billion, or 81.3% of our total loan portfolio, and our commercial business loans amounted to $2.23 billion, or 16.8% of our total loan portfolio. At such date, our largest outstanding C&I loan was $86.7 million, our largest multiple borrower relationship was $165.4 million and our largest outstanding CRE loan was $94.1 million. CRE and commercial business loans are generally considered riskier than single-family or multi-family residential loans because they have larger balances to a single borrower or group of related borrowers. CRE and commercial business loans involve risks because the borrowers\u2019 ability to repay the loans typically depends primarily on the successful operation of the businesses or the properties securing the loans. Most of the Company\u2019s commercial business loans are made to small or middle market business customers who may have a heightened vulnerability to economic conditions. Moreover, a portion of these borrowers may not have experienced a complete business or economic cycle. Furthermore, the deterioration of our borrowers\u2019 businesses may hinder their ability to repay their loans with us, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nLEGAL AND REGULATORY COMPLIANCE RISKS\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, which could adversely affect our business.\nOur operations are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local governmental authorities and are subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing requirements and restrictions on all or part of our operations. Federal and state banking regulators have significant discretion and authority to prevent or remedy what they perceive to be unsafe or unsound practices or violations of laws or regulations by financial institutions and bank holding companies in the performance of their supervisory and enforcement duties. The exercise of regulatory authority may have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, in order to conduct certain activities, including acquisitions, we are required to obtain regulatory approval. There can be no assurance that any required approvals can be obtained, or obtained without conditions or on a timeframe acceptable to the Company. The laws, rules and regulations applicable to us are subject to regular modification and change. Regulations affecting banks and other financial institutions, such as the Dodd-Frank Act, are continuously reviewed and change frequently. The ultimate effect of such changes cannot be predicted. Compliance with such regulations and laws may increase our costs and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities. There can be no assurance that laws, rules and regulations will not be proposed or adopted in the future, which could (i) make compliance much more difficult or expensive, (ii) restrict our ability to originate, modify, broker or sell loans or accept certain deposits, (iii) restrict our ability to collect on defaulted loans or foreclose on property securing loans, (iv) further limit or restrict the amount of commissions, interest or other charges earned on loans originated or sold by us, or (v) otherwise materially and adversely affect our business or prospects for business. These risks could affect our deposit funding and the performance and value of our loan and investment securities portfolios, which could negatively affect our financial performance and financial condition.\nFederal and state regulatory agencies, including the Federal Reserve, the DFPI, and the CFPB, periodically conduct examinations of our business, including compliance with laws and regulations. If, as a result of an examination, a regulatory agency were to determine in its discretion that the financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity, or other aspects of any of our operations had become unsatisfactory, or that the Company or its management was in violation of any law or regulation, it may take a number of different remedial actions as it deems appropriate. These actions include the power to enjoin \u201cunsafe or unsound\u201d practices, to require affirmative actions to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice, to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced, to direct an increase in our capital, to restrict our growth, to assess civil monetary penalties against the Bank or our officers or directors, to remove officers and directors and, if it is concluded that such conditions cannot be corrected or there is an imminent risk of loss to depositors, to terminate our deposit insurance. If we become subject to such regulatory actions, our business, results of operations and reputation may be negatively impacted.\nRegulations relating to privacy, information security, and data protection could increase our costs, affect or limit how we collect and use personal information, and adversely affect our business opportunities.\nWe are subject to various privacy, information security and data protection laws, such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which among other things requires privacy disclosures, and maintenance of a robust security program that are increasingly subject to change which could have a significant impact on our current and planned privacy, data protection and information security-related practices, our collection, use, sharing, retention and safeguarding of consumer or employee information, and some of our current or planned business activities. We are also subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, which came into effect on January 1, 2020, and provides a new private right of action for data breaches and requires companies that process information on California residents to make new disclosures to consumers about their data collection, use and sharing practices and allow consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties. Our regulators also hold us responsible for privacy and data protection obligations performed by our third party service providers while providing services to us.\nNew or changes to existing laws increase our costs of compliance and business operations and could reduce income from certain business initiatives, including increased privacy-related enforcement activity, higher compliance and technology costs and could restrict our ability to provide certain products and services. Our failure to comply with privacy, data protection and information security laws could result in potentially significant regulatory or governmental investigations or actions, litigation, fines, sanctions and damage to our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are subject to heightened regulatory requirements as our total assets exceed $10 billion.\nOur total assets were approximately $20 billion as of December 31, 2020, and our total assets have exceeded $10 billion since July 2018. The Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations impose various additional requirements on banks and bank holding companies with $10 billion or more in total assets, including a more frequent and enhanced regulatory examination regime. In addition, banks with $10 billion or more in total assets (including our bank) are primarily examined by the CFPB with respect to various federal consumer financial protection laws and regulations, with the Federal Reserve maintaining supervision over some consumer related regulations. In light of the recent change in the U.S. Presidential administration, there is some uncertainty as to how the CFPB examination and regulatory authority might impact our business in the near and medium terms.\nOne key Dodd-Frank Act requirement applicable to banks with $10 billion or more in total assets has been compulsory stress testing (Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test or \u201cDFAST\u201d). The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, signed into law on May 24, 2018, increased the asset threshold at which company-run stress tests are required from $10 billion to $250 billion. The elimination of DFAST has not eliminated the expectation of the regulatory agencies that we will conduct enhanced capital stress testing. However, standards establishing the framework surrounding such expectations have not been announced. The unknown nature and extent of future stress testing requirements creates uncertainty with respect to the impact of those requirements on our business. In addition, compliance with stress testing requirements may necessitate that we hire additional compliance or other personnel, design and implement additional internal controls, or incur other significant expenses, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nSince July 1, 2019, we became subject to reduced interchange income, which has resulted in reduced revenues. Debit card interchange fee restrictions set forth in the Dodd-Frank Act, which is known as the Durbin Amendment, as implemented by regulations of the Federal Reserve, cap the maximum debit interchange fee that a bank debit card issuer with $10 billion or more in total assets may receive per transaction at the sum of $0.21 plus five basis points. A debit card issuer that adopts certain fraud prevention procedures may charge an additional $0.01 per transaction. Becoming subject to the Durbin Amendment has negatively affected, and may in the future negatively affect our debit card related fee income and pre-tax earnings.\nWe remain subject to the risk of litigation and repurchase demands associated with our participation in the SBA PPP loan program and subsequent sale of our PPP loan portfolio, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe Company participated in the SBA Payment Protection Program (\u201cPPP\u201d) that was created to help eligible businesses, organizations and self-employed persons fund certain operational costs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Under this program, the SBA guarantees 100% of the amounts loaned under the PPP provided certain conditions are met. On July 28, 2020, the Company completed the sale of its entire portfolio of PPP loans. Nevertheless, the Company remains subject to potential litigation and repurchase demands related to its participation in the program. If a deficiency in the manner in which a PPP loan was originated is identified to be the result of the Company\u2019s noncompliance with PPP requirements, the SBA may deny its liability under the guaranty and a repurchase demand could be triggered. Other financial institutions have experienced litigation related to their process and procedures used in processing applications for the PPP. Any material financial liability, litigation costs, or reputational damage caused by PPP related litigation or repurchase demands could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRISK RELATED TO RISK MANAGEMENT\nA failure, interruption, or breach in the security of our systems, or those of contracted vendors, could disrupt our business, result in the disclosure of confidential information, damage our reputation, and create significant financial and legal exposure.\nAlthough we devote significant resources to maintain and regularly update our systems and processes that are designed to protect the security of our computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets, as well as the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information belonging to us and our customers, there is no assurance that all of our security measures will provide absolute security.\nMany financial institutions, including the Company, have been subjected to attempts to infiltrate the security of their websites or other systems, some involving sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data, disrupt or degrade service, sabotage systems or cause other damage, including through the introduction of computer viruses or malware, cyber-attacks and other means. We have been targeted by individuals and groups using phishing campaigns, pretext calling, malicious code and viruses, and have experienced distributed denial-of-service attacks with the objective of disrupting on-line banking services and expect to be subject to such attacks in the future.\nDespite efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems, it is possible that we may not be able to anticipate, detect or recognize threats to our systems or to implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types inside or outside our business, especially because the techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched, and because cyber-attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources, including individuals or groups who are associated with external service providers or who are or may be involved in organized crime or linked to terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments. Those parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers, third-party service providers or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or that of our customers or clients. Similar to other companies, risks and exposures related to cybersecurity attacks have increased as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the related increased reliance on remote working and increase in digital operations in efforts to comply with state and local mandates. Such risks and exposures are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats and the expanding use of technology, as our web-based product offerings grow or we expand internal usage of web-based applications.\nA successful penetration or circumvention of the security of our systems, including those of our third-party vendors, could cause serious negative consequences, including significant disruption of our operations, misappropriation of confidential information, or damage to computers or systems, and may result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, financial loss, loss of confidence in our security measures, customer dissatisfaction, increased insurance premiums, significant litigation exposure and harm to our reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and future prospects.\nWe rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure.\nWe rely on certain third parties to provide products and services necessary to maintain day-to-day operations, such as data processing and storage, recording and monitoring transactions, on-line banking interfaces and services, Internet connections, telecommunications, and network access. Even though we have a vendor risk management program to help us carefully select and monitor the performance of third parties, we do not control their actions. The failure of a third-party to perform in accordance with the contracted arrangements under service level agreements as a result of changes in the third party\u2019s organizational structure, financial condition, support for existing products and services, strategic focus, system interruption or breaches, or for any other reason, could be disruptive to our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Replacing these third parties could also create significant delays and expense. Accordingly, use of such third parties introduces additional risks to our business operations.\nA natural disaster or recurring energy shortage, especially in California, as well as other risks related to the issue of climate change, could harm our business.\nWe are based in Irvine, California and, at December 31, 2020, approximately 61% of the aggregate outstanding principal of our loans was tied to businesses or secured by real estate located in California. In addition, the computer systems that operate our Internet websites and some of their back-up systems are located in Irvine, California and Las Vegas, Nevada. Historically, California has been vulnerable to natural disasters, such as earthquakes, wildfires, floods, mudslides, and droughts. Certain of these natural disasters may be exacerbated by changing climate conditions.\nNatural or man-made disasters and severe weather events may cause operational disruptions and damage to both our properties and properties securing our loans. Natural disasters could harm our operations directly through interference with communications, including the interruption or loss of our information technology structure and websites, which could prevent us from gathering deposits, originating loans, and processing and controlling our flow of business, as well as through the destruction of facilities and our operational, financial, and management information systems. The measures we implemented to mitigate the risk of business interruption from natural disasters may not protect us fully from the effects of a natural disaster. A natural disaster or recurring power outages may also impair the value of our largest class of assets, our loan portfolio. Uninsured or underinsured disasters may reduce borrowers\u2019 ability to repay mortgage loans. Disasters or recurring power outages may diminish the profitability of our business customers and reduce their ability to repay business loans. Disasters may also reduce the value of the real estate securing our loans, impairing our ability to recover on defaulted loans through foreclosure and making it more likely that we would suffer losses on defaulted loans. California has also experienced energy and water shortages, which, if they recur, could impair the value of the real estate or hinder the operations of businesses, including agricultural businesses, in those areas affected. The occurrence of natural disasters or energy shortages in California could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFurther, political and social attention to the issue of climate change has increased. Federal and state legislatures and regulatory agencies continue to propose and advance numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives seeking to mitigate the effects of climate change. As a financial institution, it is unclear how future government regulations and shifts in business trends resulting from increased concern about climate change will affect our operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO STRATEGIC GROWTH\nAcquisitions may disrupt our business.\nWe have consummated eleven acquisitions since 2010. Most recently, we completed the acquisition of Opus, a California state chartered bank with approximately $8 billion in total assets on June 1, 2020. The success of the Opus acquisition or any future acquisition we may consummate will depend on, among other things, our ability to realize the anticipated revenue enhancements and efficiencies and to combine our business with the business of the target institution in a manner that does not materially disrupt the existing customer relationships of either institution, or result in decreased revenues resulting from any loss of customers, and that permits growth opportunities to occur. If we are not able to successfully achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of the subject acquisition may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected.\nIt is possible that the integration process associated with any pending or future acquisition could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, depositors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions. Integration efforts could also divert management attention and resources. These integration matters could have an adverse effect on the combined Company.\nAcquisitions may dilute stockholder value.\nThe acquisition of Opus was an all-stock transaction valued at approximately $749.6 million as of the date of close. The consideration payable to Opus stockholders upon consummation of the acquisition consisted of whole shares of the Corporation\u2019s common stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares of the Corporation\u2019s common stock. We issued approximately 34.4 million shares of common stock to Opus stockholders in connection with the acquisition, and the transaction resulted in initial tangible book value dilution of 2.8%, or $0.53 per share at the time of closing with an earnback period of 1.8 years. Future mergers or acquisitions, if any, may involve cash, debt or equity securities as transaction consideration. Acquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and market values, and, therefore, some dilution of our stock\u2019s tangible book value and net income per common share may occur in connection with any future transaction. We cannot say with any certainty that we will be able to consummate, or if consummated, successfully integrate any future acquisitions, or that we will not incur disruptions or unexpected expenses in integrating such acquisitions. Furthermore, failure to realize the expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence, and/or other projected benefits from pending or future acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in the value of goodwill and intangible assets could reduce our earnings.\nWhen the Company acquires a business, a substantial portion of the purchase price of the acquisition is allocated to goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets. The amount of the purchase price that is allocated to goodwill is determined by the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had approximately $984.1 million of goodwill and intangible assets, which includes goodwill of approximately $898.6 million resulting from the acquisitions the Company has consummated since 2011. The Company accounts for goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with GAAP, which requires goodwill be tested for impairment at least annually, at the reporting unit level, or more frequently if events and circumstances lead management to believe the value of goodwill may be impaired. GAAP also requires that intangible assets other than goodwill be tested for impairment when events and circumstances change, indicating that their carrying value may not be recoverable. For intangible assets other than goodwill, the Company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine if the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. A quantitative assessment is followed to determine the amount of impairment in the event the carrying value of such assets are deemed not recoverable. Impairment is measured as the amount by which their carrying value exceeds their estimated fair value.\nIn testing goodwill for impairment, GAAP allows the Company to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not the carrying value of those assets are impaired. The Company\u2019s qualitative assessment considers known positive and negative as well as any mitigating events and circumstances associated with each relevant factor that may be deemed to have an impact on the value of the Company. Such factors may include various relevant economic, industry, market and company specific factors that may have an impact on the value of the Company. Should the Company\u2019s qualitative assessment indicate the value of goodwill and intangible assets could be impaired, a quantitative assessment is then performed to determine whether there is impairment. However, GAAP also allows the Company, at its option, to unconditionally forego the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to a quantitative assessment. This assessment involves determining the fair value of the reporting unit (which in our case is the Company) and comparing that determination of fair value to the carrying value of the Company in order to quantify the amount of possible impairment. If the fair value of the reporting unit is below its carrying value, the Company would then recognize the amount of impairment as the amount by which the reporting unit\u2019s carrying value exceeds its fair value, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. The estimation of fair values involves a high degree of judgment and subjectivity in the assumptions used. Changes in the local and national economy, the federal and state legislative and regulatory environments for financial institutions, the stock market, interest rates, and other external factors (such as natural disasters, pandemics such as the Covid-19 pandemic, or significant world events) may occur from time to time, often with great unpredictability, and may materially impact the fair value of publicly traded financial institutions and result in a goodwill impairment charge at a future date. If we were to conclude that a future write-down of our goodwill or intangible assets is necessary, we would record the appropriate charge, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO COMPETITION\nOur ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to our success.\nOur employees are our most important resource. Competition for qualified personnel is intense in many areas of the financial services industry. We endeavor to attract talented and diverse new employees and retain and motivate our existing employees to assist in executing our growth, acquisition, and business strategies. We also seek to retain proven, experienced senior employees with superior talent, augmented from time to time by external hires, to provide continuity of succession of our executive management team. Losses of or changes in our current executive officers or other key personnel, or the inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face strong competition from financial services companies and other companies that offer banking services, which could materially and adversely affect our business.\nThe financial services industry has become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued banking consolidation, which may increase in connection with current economic, market and political conditions. We face substantial competition in all phases of our operations from a variety of competitors, including national banks, regional banks, community banks and, more recently, financial technology (or \"fintech\") companies. Many of our competitors offer the same banking services that we offer and our success depends on our ability to adapt our products and services to evolving industry standards. Increased competition in our market may result in reduced new loan production and/or decreased deposit balances or less favorable terms on loans and leases and/or deposit accounts. We also face competition from many other types of financial institutions, including without limitation, non-bank specialty lenders, insurance companies, private investment funds, investment banks, and other financial intermediaries. Many of our competitors have significantly greater resources, established customer bases, more locations, and longer operating histories. Should competition in the financial services industry intensify, our ability to market our products and services may be adversely affected. If we are unable to attract and retain banking customers, we may be unable to grow or maintain the levels of our loans and deposits and our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected as a result. Ultimately, we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors.\nFailure to keep pace with technological change could adversely affect our business.\nThe financial services industry experiences continuous technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Many of our competitors, however, have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements or are technology focused start-ups with internally developed cloud-native systems that offer improved user interfaces and experiences. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. In addition, we depend on internal and outsourced technology to support all aspects of our business operations. Interruption or failure of these systems creates a risk of business loss as a result of adverse customer experiences and possible diminishing of our reputation, damage claims or civil fines. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry or to successfully implement core processing strategies could have a material adverse impact on our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RISKS\nWe are subject to liquidity risk, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nEffective liquidity management is essential for the operation of our business. Although we have implemented strategies to maintain sufficient and diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned, as well as unanticipated, changes in assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet commitments under various economic conditions, an inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of investment securities and other sources could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry in general. Factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity due to a market disruption, a decrease in the borrowing capacity assigned to our pledged assets by our secured creditors, or adverse regulatory action against us. Deterioration in economic conditions and the loss of confidence in financial institutions may increase our cost of funding and limit our access to some of our customary sources of liquidity, including, but not limited to, inter-bank borrowings and borrowings from the Federal Reserve and FHLB. Our ability to acquire deposits or borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as a severe disruption of the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry generally as a result of conditions faced by banking organizations in the domestic and international credit markets.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future and such capital may not be available when needed or at all.\nWe are required by federal and state regulators to maintain adequate levels of capital. We may need to raise additional capital in the future to meet regulatory or other internal requirements. As a publicly traded company, a likely source of additional funds is the capital markets, accomplished generally through the issuance of equity, both common and preferred stock, and the issuance of debt. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on, among other things, conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside of our control, and our financial performance.\nWe cannot provide any assurance that access to such capital will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. Any occurrence that may limit our access to the capital markets, such as a decline in the confidence of debt purchasers or counter-parties participating in the capital markets, may materially and adversely affect our capital costs and our ability to raise capital and, in turn, our liquidity. Further, if we need to raise capital in the future, we may have to do so when many other financial institutions are also seeking to raise capital and would then have to compete with those institutions for investors. The inability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms when needed could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWe are subject to capital adequacy standards, and a failure to meet these standards could adversely affect our financial condition.\nThe Corporation and the Bank are each subject to capital adequacy and liquidity rules and other regulatory requirements specifying minimum amounts and types of capital that must be maintained. From time to time, the regulators implement changes to these regulatory capital adequacy and liquidity guidelines. If we fail to meet these minimum capital and liquidity guidelines and other regulatory requirements, we may be restricted in the types of activities we may conduct and may be prohibited from taking certain capital actions, such as making payments on certain capital instruments, paying executive bonuses or dividends, and repurchasing or redeeming capital securities.\nRISKS FROM ACCOUNTING AND OTHER ESTIMATES\nThe Company's consolidated financial statements are based in part on assumptions and estimates which, if incorrect, could cause unexpected losses in the future.\nWe have made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period to prepare these consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Material estimates subject to change in the near term include, among other items, the allowance for credit losses, particularly in light of the adoption of the new CECL standard on January 1, 2020; the carrying value of goodwill or other intangible assets; the fair value estimates of certain assets and liabilities; and the realization of deferred tax assets and liabilities. These estimates may be adjusted as more current information becomes available, and any adjustment may be significant.\nThere are risks resulting from the extensive use of models in our business.\nWe rely on quantitative models to measure risks and to estimate certain financial values. Models may be used in such processes as determining the pricing of various products, grading loans and extending credit, measuring interest rate and other market risks, predicting or estimating losses, assessing capital adequacy and calculating regulatory capital levels, as well as to estimate the value of financial instruments and balance sheet items. Poorly designed or implemented models present the risk that our business decisions based on information incorporating model output could be adversely affected due to the inaccuracy of that information. Models are often based on historical experience to predict future outcomes, as a result new experiences or events which are not part of historical experience can significantly increase model imprecision and impact model reliability. Model inputs can also include information provided by third parties, such as economic forecasts or macroeconomic variables (unemployment rates, real GDP etc.) upon which we rely. Some of the decisions that our regulators make, including those related to capital distributions, could be affected due to the perception that the quality of the models used to generate the relevant information is insufficient, which could have a negative impact on our ability to make capital distributions in the form of dividends or share repurchases. Our reliance on models continues to increase as rules, guidance and expectations change. The most recent example of this is the additional models used in the determination of our allowance for credit losses under CECL, which we adopted on January 1, 2020.\nRISKS RELATED TO INVESTMENTS IN OUR SECURITIES\nDividends from the Bank are a primary source of the Corporation\u2019s liquidity from which, among other things, dividends to stockholders may be paid.\nOur ability to pay cash dividends to our stockholders is partially dependent upon receiving dividends from the Bank. The Bank\u2019s ability to pay dividends to us is subject to restrictions set forth in the Financial Code. The Financial Code provides that a bank may not make a cash distribution to its stockholders in excess of the lesser of (1) a bank\u2019s retained earnings and (2) a bank\u2019s net income for its last three fiscal years, less the amount of any distributions made by the bank or by any majority-owned subsidiary of the bank to the stockholders of the bank during such period. However, a bank may, with the approval of the DFPI, make a distribution to its stockholders in an amount not exceeding the greatest of (a) its retained earnings; (b) its net income for its last fiscal year; or (c) its net income for its current fiscal year. In the event that banking regulators determine that the stockholders\u2019 equity of a bank is inadequate or that the making of a distribution by the bank would be unsafe or unsound, the regulators may order the bank to refrain from making a proposed distribution.\nApproval of the Federal Reserve is required for payment of any dividend by a state chartered bank that is a member of the Federal Reserve System, such as the Bank, if the total of all dividends declared by the Bank in any calendar year would exceed the total of its retained net income for that year combined with its retained net income for the preceding two years. In addition, a state member bank may not pay a dividend in an amount greater than its undivided profits without regulatory and stockholder approval. The Bank is also prohibited under federal law from paying any dividend that would cause it to become undercapitalized. A reduction or discontinuance of dividends from the Bank to the Corporation could have an adverse effect on our ability to pay dividends on our common stock, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, including the market price of our common stock.\nWe may reduce or discontinue the payment of dividends on, or repurchases of, our common stock.\nOur stockholders are only entitled to receive such dividends as our Board may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. In addition, in January 2021, our Board authorized us to repurchase up to 4,725,000 shares of our common stock. We are not required to pay dividends on, or effect repurchases of, our common stock and may reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend and/or share repurchase program in the future. Our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders is subject to the restrictions set forth in Delaware law, by the Federal Reserve, and by certain covenants contained in our subordinated debentures. Notification to the Federal Reserve is also required prior to our declaring and paying a cash dividend to our stockholders during any period in which our quarterly and/or cumulative twelve-month net earnings are insufficient to fund the dividend amount, among other requirements. We may not pay a dividend if the Federal Reserve objects or until such time as we receive approval from the Federal Reserve or we no longer need to provide notice under applicable regulations. In addition, we may be restricted by applicable law or regulation or actions taken by our regulators, now or in the future, from paying dividends to, or repurchasing shares of our common stock from, our stockholders. We cannot provide assurance that we will continue paying dividends on, or repurchase shares of, our common stock at current levels or at all. A reduction or discontinuance of dividends on our common stock or our share repurchase program could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 85020, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "PPBI"}
