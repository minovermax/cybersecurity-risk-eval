RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information contained in this Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business. Our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business and operations.\nOur industry is highly cyclical, and prolonged periods of weak demand or excess supply may reduce our net sales and/or margins, which may reduce our net income or cause us to incur losses.\nThe building products distribution industry is subject to cyclical market pressures. Prices of building products are determined by overall supply and demand in the market. Market prices of building products historically have been volatile and cyclical, and we have limited ability to control the timing and amount of pricing changes. Demand for building products is driven mainly by factors outside of our control, such as general economic and political conditions, interest rates, availability of mortgage financing, the construction, repair and remodeling markets, industrial markets, weather, and population growth. The supply of building products fluctuates based on available manufacturing capacity, and excess capacity in the industry can result in significant declines in market prices for those products. To the extent that prices and volumes experience a sustained or sharp decline, our net sales and margins likely would decline as well. Because we have substantial fixed costs, a decrease in sales and margin generally may have a significant adverse impact on our financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.\nAdditionally, many of the building products which we distribute, including OSB, plywood, lumber, and particleboard, are commodities that are widely available from other distributors or manufacturers, with prices and volumes determined frequently\nin an auction market based on participants\u2019 perceptions of short-term supply and demand factors. At times, the purchase price for any one or more of the products we produce or distribute may fall below our purchase costs, requiring us to incur short-term losses on product sales.\nAll of these factors make it difficult to forecast our operating results.\nOur industry is dependent on the homebuilding industry, and any future downturns would materially affect our business, liquidity, and operating results.\nOur sales depend heavily on the strength of national and local new residential construction, home improvement, and remodeling markets. The strength of these markets depends on new housing starts and residential renovation projects, which are a function of many factors beyond our control. Some of these factors include general economic conditions, employment levels, job and household formation, interest rates, housing prices, tax policy, availability of mortgage financing, prices of commodity wood and steel products, immigration patterns, regional demographics, and consumer confidence. Our results of operations were adversely affected by the severe downturn in new housing activity in the U.S., and, while conditions are improving, any future downturns in the markets that we serve or in the economy generally may have a material adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity, and financial condition. Reduced levels of construction activity may result in continued intense price competition among building materials suppliers, which may adversely affect our gross margins. We cannot provide assurance that our responses to future downturns in the economy in general, and in the residential housing market in particular, will be successful.\nA significant portion of our sales are on credit to our customers. Material changes in their creditworthiness or our inability to forecast deterioration in their credit position could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, cash flow, and liquidity.\nThe majority of our sales are on account where we provide credit to our customers. Market disruptions could cause economic downturns, which may lead to lower demand for our products and increased incidence of customers\u2019 inability to pay their accounts. Bankruptcies by our customers may cause us to incur bad debt expense at levels higher than historically experienced. In fiscal 2014, less than 0.1% in bad debt expense to total net sales was incurred related to credit sales. Our customers generally are susceptible to the same economic business risks as those to which we are exposed. Furthermore, we may not necessarily be aware of any deterioration in our customers\u2019 financial position. If our customers\u2019 financial position were to become significantly impaired, it could have a material impact on our bad debt exposure, which may result in a material adverse effect on our operating results, cash flow and liquidity. In addition, certain of our suppliers may be impacted as well, causing disruption or delay of product availability. These events could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flow, and financial position.\nOur cash flows and capital resources may be insufficient to make required payments on our substantial indebtedness, future indebtedness, or to maintain our required level of excess liquidity.\nWe have a substantial amount of debt which could have important consequences to you. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nmake it difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations;\n\u2022\nmake us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and other general corporate requirements;\n\u2022\nexpose us to interest rate fluctuations because the interest rate on the debt under our U.S. revolving credit facility is variable;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows to payments on our debt, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flows for operations and other purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, and the industry in which we operate; and\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that may have proportionately less debt, and therefore may be in a better position to obtain favorable credit terms.\nIn addition, our ability to make scheduled payments or refinance our obligations depends on our successful financial and operating performance, cash flows, and capital resources, which in turn depend upon prevailing economic conditions and certain financial, business, and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include, among others:\n\u2022\neconomic and demand factors affecting the building products distribution industry;\n\u2022\nexternal factors affecting availability of credit;\n\u2022\npricing pressures;\n\u2022\nincreased operating costs;\n\u2022\ncompetitive conditions; and\n\u2022\nother operating difficulties.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell material assets or operations, obtain additional capital, or restructure our debt. Obtaining additional capital or restructuring our debt could be accomplished in part through new or additional borrowings or placements of debt or securities. There is no assurance that we could obtain additional capital or refinance our debt on terms acceptable to us, or at all. In the event that we are required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations, the value realized on the disposition of such assets or operations will depend on market conditions and the availability of buyers. Accordingly, any such sale may not, among other things, be for a sufficient dollar amount. Our obligations under the revolving credit facilities are secured by a first priority security interest in all of our operating subsidiaries and BlueLinx Building Products Canada Ltd.\u2019s (\u201cBlueLinx Canada\u201d) (for the Canadian revolving credit facility) inventories, accounts receivable, and proceeds from those items. In addition, our mortgage loan is secured by the majority of our real property. The foregoing encumbrances may limit our ability to dispose of material assets or operations. We may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, including under the revolving credit facilities. Our incurring additional indebtedness would intensify the risks described above.\nThe instruments governing our indebtedness contain various covenants limiting the discretion of our management in operating our business, including requiring us to maintain a minimum level of excess liquidity.\nOur revolving credit facilities and mortgage loan contain various restrictive covenants and restrictions, including financial covenants customary for asset-based loans that limit management\u2019s discretion in operating our business. In particular, these instruments limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur additional debt;\n\u2022\ngrant liens on assets;\n\u2022\nmake investments, including capital expenditures;\n\u2022\nsell or acquire assets outside the ordinary course of business;\n\u2022\nengage in transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022\nmake fundamental business changes.\nAs of January 3, 2015, the U.S. revolving credit facility requires us to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.1 to 1.0 in the event our excess availability under the U.S. revolving credit facility falls below the greater of $33.2 million during the time the Tranche A Loan is outstanding, and $31.8 million at all times thereafter; or the amount equal to 12.5% of the lesser of the borrowing base or $467.5 million during the time the Tranche A Loan is outstanding, and $447.5 million at all times thereafter (the \u201cExcess Availability Threshold\u201d). If we fail to maintain this minimum excess availability, the U.S. revolving credit facility requires us to (i) maintain certain financial ratios, which we would not meet with current operating results, and (ii) limit our capital expenditures, which would have a negative impact on our ability to finance working capital needs and capital expenditures.\nIf we fail to comply with the restrictions in the U.S. revolving credit facility, the Canadian revolving credit facility, the mortgage loan documents, or any other current or future financing agreements, a default may allow the creditors under the relevant instruments to accelerate the related debts and to exercise their remedies under these agreements, which typically will include the right to declare the principal amount of that debt, together with accrued and unpaid interest, and other related amounts, immediately due and payable, to exercise any remedies the creditors may have to foreclose on assets that are subject to liens securing that debt, and to terminate any commitments they had made to supply further funds.\nWe source many products internationally, and are exposed to risks associated with doing business globally.\nWe import a variety of products from countries located in Asia, South America, and the Middle East. The business, regulatory, and political environments in these countries differ from those in the U.S. Our global sourcing strategy is subject to risks and uncertainties, including changes in foreign country regulatory requirements; differing business practices associated with foreign operations; imposition of foreign tariffs and other trade barriers; political, legal, and economic instability; foreign\ncurrency exchange rate fluctuations; foreign country tax rules, regulations and other requirements, such as changes in tax rates and statutory and judicial interpretations in tax laws; inflation; differing labor laws and changes in those laws; government price controls; and work stoppages and disruptions in the shipping of imported and exported products.\nOur transportation operations are subject to significant governmental regulation.\nWe use our own fleet of tractors and trailers to service customers throughout the U.S. Our transportation operations are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction and broad administrative powers of the DOT. If we fail to comply adequately with DOT regulations or regulations become more stringent, we could experience increased inspections, regulatory authorities could take remedial action including imposing fines or shutting down our operations or we could be subject to increased audit and compliance costs. If any of these events were to occur, our results of operations, business, cash flow, and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nEnvironmental laws impose risks and costs on us.\nOur operations are subject to federal, state, provincial, and local laws, rules, and regulations governing the protection of the environment, including, but not limited to, those regulating discharges into the air and water, the use, handling and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances, the management of wastes, the cleanup of contamination, and the control of noise and odors. We have made, and will continue to make, expenditures to comply with these requirements. While we believe, based upon current information, that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable environmental laws, rules, and regulations, we could be subject to potentially significant fines or penalties for any failure to comply. Moreover, under certain environmental laws, a current or previous owner or operator of real property, and parties that generate or transport hazardous substances that are disposed of at that real property, may be held liable for the cost to investigate or clean up such real property, and for related damages to natural resources. We may be subject to liability, including liability for investigation and cleanup costs, if contamination is discovered at one of our current or former warehouse facilities, or at a landfill or other location where we have disposed of, or arranged for the disposal of, wastes. We have an indemnification agreement with Georgia-Pacific, which has agreed to indemnify us against any claim arising from environmental conditions in connection with the properties we acquired when we purchased the assets of its distribution division on May 7, 2004. However, any remediation costs either not related to conditions existing prior to May 7, 2004 or on properties acquired after May 7, 2004 may not be covered by indemnification. We also carry environmental insurance, but certain remediation costs may not be covered by insurance. In addition, we could be subject to claims brought pursuant to applicable laws, rules, or regulations for property damage or personal injury resulting from the environmental impact of our operations. Increasingly stringent environmental requirements, more aggressive enforcement actions, the discovery of unknown conditions, or the bringing of future claims may cause our expenditures for environmental matters to increase, and we may incur material costs associated with these matters.\nProduct shortages, loss of key suppliers, and our dependence on third-party suppliers and manufacturers could affect our financial health.\nOur ability to offer a wide variety of products to our customers is dependent upon our ability to obtain adequate product supply from manufacturers and other suppliers. Generally, our products are obtainable from various sources and in sufficient quantities. However, the loss of, or a substantial decrease in the availability of, products from our suppliers or the loss of key supplier arrangements could adversely impact our financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.\nAlthough in many instances we have agreements with our suppliers, these agreements are generally terminable by either party on limited notice. Failure by our suppliers to continue to supply us with products on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.\nOur industry is highly fragmented and competitive. If we are unable to compete effectively, our net sales and operating results will be reduced.\nThe building products distribution industry is highly fragmented and competitive, and the barriers to entry for local competitors are relatively low. Competitive factors in our industry include pricing and availability of product, service, and delivery capabilities, customer relationships, geographic coverage, and breadth of product offerings. Also, financial stability is important to suppliers and customers in choosing distributors for their products, and affects the favorability of the terms on which we are able to obtain our products from our suppliers and sell our products to our customers.\nSome of our competitors are part of larger companies, and therefore have access to greater financial and other resources than those to which we have access. In addition, certain product manufacturers sell and distribute their products directly to customers. Additional manufacturers of products distributed by us may elect to sell and distribute directly to end-users in the future or enter into exclusive supply arrangements with other distributors. Finally, we may not be able to maintain our costs at a level sufficiently low for us to compete effectively. If we are unable to compete effectively, our net sales and net income will be reduced.\nA significant percentage of our employees are unionized. Wage increases or work stoppages by our unionized employees may reduce our results of operations.\nAs of January 3, 2015, we employed approximately 1,700 persons. Approximately 34% of our employees were represented by various labor union collective bargaining agreements, of which approximately 30% are up for renewal in fiscal 2015. Although we have generally had good relations with our unionized employees, and expect to renew collective bargaining agreements as they expire, no assurances can be provided that we will be able to reach a timely agreement as to the renewal of the agreements, and their expiration or continued work under an expired agreement, as applicable, could result in a work stoppage. In addition, we may become subject to material cost increases, or additional work rules imposed by agreements with labor unions. The foregoing could increase our selling, general, and administrative expenses in absolute terms and/or as a percentage of net sales. In addition, work stoppages or other labor disturbances may occur in the future, which could adversely impact our net sales and/or selling, general, and administrative expenses. All of these factors could negatively impact our operating results and cash flows.\nIncreases in the cost of employee benefits, such as pension benefits, could impact our financial results and cash flow.\nUnfavorable changes in the cost of our pension retirement benefits and current employees\u2019 medical benefits could materially adversely impact our financial results and cash flow. We sponsor a defined benefit pension plan covering many of our hourly unionized employees. Our estimates of the amount and timing of our future funding obligations for our defined benefit pension plans are based upon various assumptions. These assumptions include, but are not limited to, the discount rate, projected return on plan assets, compensation increase rates, mortality rates, retirement patterns, and turnover rates. In addition, the amount and timing of our pension funding obligations are influenced by funding requirements that are established by the Employee Retirement Income and Security Act of 1974 (\u201cERISA\u201d), the Pension Protection Act, Congressional Acts, or other governing bodies.\nWe participate in various multi-employer pension plans in the U.S. The majority of these plans are underfunded. If, in the future, we choose to withdraw from these plans, we likely would need to record a withdrawal liability, which may be material to our financial results.\nFailure to comply with governmental laws and regulations could harm our business.\nOur business is subject to regulation by various federal, state, local, and foreign governmental agencies, including agencies responsible for monitoring and enforcing employment and labor laws, workplace safety, product safety, environmental laws, consumer protection laws, anti-bribery laws, import/export controls, federal securities laws, and tax laws and regulations. Noncompliance with applicable regulations or requirements could subject us to investigations, sanctions, mandatory product recalls, enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, fines, damages, civil and criminal penalties, or injunctions. If any governmental sanctions are imposed, or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. In addition, responding to any actions would likely result in a significant diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, and an increase in professional fees. Enforcement actions and sanctions could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nAffiliates of Cerberus control us and may have conflicts of interest with other stockholders.\nCerberus Capital Management, L.P. (\u201cCerberus\u201d), a private investment firm, beneficially owned approximately 53% of our common stock as of January 3, 2015. As a result, Cerberus is able to control the election of our directors, determine our corporate and management policies and determine, without the consent of our other stockholders, the outcome of most corporate transactions or other matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including potential mergers or acquisitions, asset sales, and other significant corporate transactions. This concentrated ownership position limits other stockholders\u2019 ability to influence corporate matters and, as a result, we may take actions that some of our stockholders may not view as beneficial.\nTwo of our nine directors are employees of or current advisors to Cerberus. Cerberus also has sufficient voting power to amend our organizational documents. The interests of Cerberus may not coincide with the interests of other holders of our common stock. Additionally, Cerberus is in the business of making investments in companies, and may, from time to time, acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. Cerberus may also pursue, for its own account, acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. So long as Cerberus continues to own a significant amount of the outstanding shares of our common stock, it will continue to be able to strongly influence or effectively control our decisions, including potential mergers or acquisitions, asset sales, and other significant corporate transactions. In addition, because we are a controlled company within the meaning of the New York Stock Exchange rules, we are exempt from the NYSE requirements that our board be composed of a majority of independent directors, that our compensation committee be composed entirely of independent directors, and that we maintain a nominating/corporate governance committee composed entirely of independent directors.\nEven if Cerberus no longer controls us in the future, certain provisions of our charter documents and agreements and Delaware law could discourage, delay, or prevent a merger or acquisition at a premium price.\nOur Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws contain provisions that:\n\u2022\npermit us to issue, without any further vote or action by the stockholders, up to 30 million shares of preferred stock in one or more series and, with respect to each series, to fix the number of shares constituting the series and the designation of the series, the voting powers (if any) of the shares of such series, and the preferences and other special rights, if any, and any qualifications, limitations or restrictions, of the shares of the series; and\n\u2022\nlimit the stockholders\u2019 ability to call special meetings.\nThese provisions may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition at a premium price.\nIn addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, or the \u201cDGCL\u201d, which also imposes certain restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15% or more of our common stock. Further, certain of our incentive plans provide for vesting of stock options and/or payments to be made to our employees in connection with a change of control, which could discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition at a premium price.\nWe are subject to information technology security risks and business interruption risks, and may incur increasing costs in an effort to minimize those risks.\nOur business employs information technology systems and a website that allow for the secure storage and transmission of customers\u2019 proprietary information. We also employ information technology systems to secure other confidential information, such as employee data. Security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, litigation, and potential liability. We may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent rapidly evolving types of cyber attacks. Any compromise of our security could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, and a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could harm our business. As cyber attacks become more sophisticated generally, we may be required to incur significant costs to strengthen our systems from outside intrusions, and/or obtain insurance coverage related to the threat of such attacks.\nAdditionally, our business is reliant upon information technology systems to place orders with our vendors and process orders from our customers. Disruption in these systems could materially impact our ability to buy and sell our products.", "PERMNO": 90496, "SIC": 5031, "TIC": "BXC"}
