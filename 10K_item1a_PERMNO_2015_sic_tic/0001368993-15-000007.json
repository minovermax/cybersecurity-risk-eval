{"cik": "1368993", "company": "WaferGen Bio-systems, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-17", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nWe operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks, some of which are beyond our control. This discussion highlights some of the risks that may affect future operating results. These are the risks and uncertainties we believe are most important to consider. We cannot be certain that we will successfully address these risks. If we are unable to address these risks, our business may not grow, our stock price may suffer and we may be unable to stay in business. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, which we currently deem immaterial or which are similar to those faced by other companies in our industry or business in general, may also impair our business operations.\nRisks Related to Our Company and Our Business\nWe have generated only limited sales, have a history of operating losses and we may not be able to reach profitability.\nWe have a history of losses and expect to continue to incur operating and net losses for the foreseeable future. We incurred a net loss of $10.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. As of December 31, 2014, our accumulated deficit was $91.5 million. We have not achieved operating profitability on a quarterly or annual basis.\nHistorically, there have been limited sales of any of our products. Our revenues were $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 and $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, of which $2.1 million was attributable to the Apollo Business that we acquired in January 2014. We will need to significantly grow our revenues to become profitable.\nWe will need to raise additional capital to meet our business requirements in the future and such capital raising may be costly or difficult to obtain and could dilute current stockholders\u2019 ownership interests.\nWe have incurred losses since inception and expect to continue to incur losses until we are able to significantly grow our revenues. Accordingly we may need additional financing to maintain and expand our business. Such financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all. Any additional capital raised through the sale of equity or equity linked securities may dilute current stockholders\u2019 ownership percentages and could also result in a decrease in the market value of our equity securities. The terms of any securities issued by us in future capital transactions may be more favorable to new investors, and may include preferences, superior voting rights and the issuance of warrants or other derivative securities, which may have a further dilutive effect on the holders of any of our securities then outstanding.\nIf we are unable to obtain additional financing on a timely basis, we may have to curtail our development activities and growth plans and/or be forced to sell assets, perhaps on unfavorable terms, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and ultimately could be forced to discontinue our operations and liquidate, in which event it is unlikely that stockholders would receive any distribution on their shares. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d below. Further, we may not be able to continue operating if we do not generate sufficient revenues from operations needed to stay in business.\nIn addition, we may incur substantial costs in pursuing future capital financing, including investment banking fees, legal fees, accounting fees, securities law compliance fees, printing and distribution expenses and other costs. We may also be required to recognize non-cash expenses in connection with certain securities we issue, such as convertible promissory notes and warrants, which may adversely impact our financial results.\nOur success depends on our ability to develop commercially successful products and on market acceptance of our new and relatively unproven technologies.\nOur future is dependent upon the success of the current and future generations of one or more of the products we sell or propose to sell, including the SmartChip System and Apollo instruments. We may not possess all of the resources, capability and intellectual property rights necessary to develop and commercialize all of the products or services that may result from our technologies. Our long-term viability, growth and profitability will depend upon successful testing, approval and commercialization of the SmartChip System incorporating our technology resulting from our research and development activities. Adverse or inconclusive results in the development and testing of our products could significantly delay or ultimately preclude commercialization of our technology. Accordingly, there is only a limited basis upon which to evaluate our business and prospects. An investor in our Company should consider the challenges, expenses, and difficulties we will face as an emerging company seeking to develop and manufacture a new product in a relatively new market.\nWe must conduct a substantial amount of additional research and development before some of our products will be ready for sale. We currently have fewer resources available for research and development activities than many of our competitors. We may not be able to develop or launch new products in a timely manner, or at all, or they may not meet customer requirements or be of sufficient quality or at a price that enables us to compete effectively in the marketplace. Challenges frequently encountered in connection with the development or early commercialization of products and services using new and relatively unproven technologies might limit our ability to develop and successfully commercialize these products and services. In addition, we may need to enter into agreements to obtain the intellectual property rights necessary to commercialize some of our products or services, which may not be available on favorable terms, or at all.\nWe have a limited operating history for investors to evaluate our business.\nWe have had limited operations in the genetic analysis segment of the life science industry. Since we are a company with a limited operating history developing products focused on the analysis of genetic function and variation, it is difficult for potential investors to evaluate our business. Our future operations and growth will likely depend on our ability to fully develop and market our SmartChip and Apollo products and services. Our proposed operations are subject to all of the risks inherent in developing and growing a new business in light of the expenses, difficulties, complications and delays frequently encountered in connection with the development of any new business, as well as those risks that are specific to the life science industry. In evaluating us, investors should consider the delays, expenses, problems and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies developing markets for new products, services and technologies. We may never overcome these obstacles and become profitable.\nBecause our business depends on research and development spending levels for pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and academic and governmental research institutions, our success and our operating results will substantially depend on these customers.\nWe expect that our revenues in the foreseeable future will be derived primarily from products and services provided to a relatively small number of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and academic, governmental and other research institutions. Our success will depend upon their demand for and use of our products and services. Our operating results may fluctuate substantially due to reductions and delays in research and development expenditures by these customers. For example, reductions in capital or operating expenditures by these customers may result in lower than expected instrumentation sales and similarly, reductions in operating expenditures by these customers could result in lower than expected sales by us.\nWe expect that our results of operations will fluctuate, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nOur revenue is subject to fluctuations due to the timing of sales of high-value products, the impact of seasonal spending patterns, the timing and size of research projects our customers perform, changes in overall spending levels in the life sciences industry, the timing and amount of government grant funding programs and other unpredictable factors that may affect customer ordering patterns. Given the difficulty in predicting the timing and magnitude of sales for our products and services, we may experience quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in revenue and/or a sequential decline in quarterly revenue.\nIf revenue does not grow significantly, we will not be able to achieve and maintain profitability. Any significant delays in the commercial launch of our products, unfavorable sales trends in our existing product lines, or impacts from the other factors mentioned above could adversely affect our revenue growth or cause a sequential decline in quarterly revenues. Due to the\npossibility of fluctuations in our revenue and expenses, we believe that quarterly comparisons of our results are not a good indication of our future performance. If our operating results fluctuate or do not meet the expectations of stock market analysts and investors, our stock price probably would decline.\nIf we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain additional qualified personnel, we may be unable to achieve our goals.\nWe are highly dependent on our management and scientific personnel. The loss of their services could adversely impact our ability to achieve our business objectives. We compete for qualified management and scientific personnel with other life science companies, universities and research institutions, particularly those focusing on genomics. Competition for these individuals, particularly in the San Francisco Bay area, is intense, and the turnover rate can be high. Failure to attract and retain management and scientific personnel could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or detect fraud. Consequently, investors could lose confidence in our financial reporting and this may decrease the trading price of our common stock.\nWe must maintain effective disclosure and internal controls to provide reliable financial reports. We have been assessing our controls to identify areas that need improvement. Based on our evaluation as of December 31, 2014, we concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2014, however we have identified material weaknesses in the past and may do so again in the future. Failure to maintain the improvements in our controls as necessary to maintain an effective system of such controls could harm our ability to accurately report our operating results and cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information. Any such loss of confidence would have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nAny failure to maintain adequate disclosure and internal controls may result in restatements of our financial statements and may cause us to become subject to additional risks and uncertainties, including, among others, increased professional fees and expenses, the increased possibility of legal proceedings and review by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) and other regulatory bodies and could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, shareholder class actions or derivative actions. We could face monetary judgments, penalties or other sanctions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause our stock price to decline.\nLitigation or other proceedings or third-party claims of intellectual property infringement could require us to spend significant time and money and could prevent us from selling our products or services or adversely impact our stock price.\nOur commercial success depends in part on our non-infringement of the patents or proprietary rights of third parties and the ability to protect our own intellectual property.\nThird parties may assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization even if we are not. As we enter new markets, we expect that competitors will likely assert that our products infringe their intellectual property rights as part of a business strategy to impede our successful entry into those markets. Third parties such as Life Technologies Corporation, the Roche family of companies, Biometra Biomedizinische Analytik GmbH, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Eppendorf AG, Enzo Biochem, Inc., Affymetrix, Inc., Illumina, Inc., Agilent Technologies, Inc., GE Healthcare, Beckman Coulter, Inc., Sequenom, Inc., RainDance Technologies, Inc., Qiagen N.V., Idaho Technology, Inc., PerkinElmer, Inc., Fluidigm Corporation, Cepheid, Pacific Biosciences of California, Inc., the Exiqon family of companies, Luminex Corporation and others may have obtained and may in the future obtain patents and claim that manufacture, use and/or sale of our technologies, methods or products infringes these patents. We could incur substantial costs and divert the attention of our management and technical personnel in defending ourselves against these claims even if we are eventually successful in defending ourselves against these claims. Furthermore, parties making claims against us may be able to obtain injunctive or other relief, which effectively could block our ability to further develop, commercialize, manufacture, use and sell methods and products, and could result in the award of substantial damages against us. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we may be required to pay damages and obtain one or more licenses from third parties, or be prohibited from making, using or selling certain methods and/or products. We may not be able to obtain these licenses at a reasonable cost, or at all. In that event, we could encounter delays in product introductions while we attempt to develop alternative methods or products. Defense of any lawsuit or failure to obtain any of these licenses on favorable terms could prevent us from commercializing products, and the prohibition of sale of any of our products could materially affect our ability to grow and to attain profitability.\nOur proprietary intellectual property rights may not adequately protect our products and technologies.\nAlthough we have filed a number of United States and international patent applications, we presently have four patents issued in the United States, which do not cover all of our products and technologies. Our commercial success will depend in part on obtaining and maintaining patent protection and trade secret protection for our products and technologies. Patent law relating to claims in the technology fields in which we operate is uncertain, so we cannot be assured the patent rights we have, or may obtain in future, will be valuable or enforceable. We may only be able to protect products and technologies from unauthorized use by third parties to the extent that valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets cover them. Furthermore, the degree of future protection of our proprietary rights is uncertain because legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep a competitive advantage.\nThe patent positions of life sciences companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved. No consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in such companies\u2019 patents has emerged to date in the United States. The laws of some countries other than the United States do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending such rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biotechnology and/or pharmaceuticals, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of any patents we may obtain in such countries. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial cost and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business. Changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States or other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents or in third-party patents. For example:\n\u00b7\nwe might not have been the first to conceive or reduce to practice one or more inventions disclosed in our pending patent applications;\n\u00b7\nwe might not have been the first to file patent applications for these inventions;\n\u00b7\nothers may independently develop similar or alternative products and technologies or duplicate any of our products and technologies;\n\u00b7\nit is possible that none of our pending patent applications will result in issued patents, and even if they issue as patents, they may not provide a basis for commercially viable products, and/or may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or may be challenged and invalidated by third parties;\n\u00b7\nwe may not develop additional proprietary products and technologies that are patentable; and\n\u00b7\nthird-party patents may have an adverse effect on our ability to continue to grow our business.\nWe have applied, and continue to apply, for patents covering our intellectual property (e.g., products and technologies and uses thereof), as we deem appropriate. However, we may fail to apply for patents on products and/or technologies in a timely fashion or at all.\nWe also rely on trade secrets to protect our technology, especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. While we attempt to use reasonable efforts to protect our trade secrets, our employees, consultants, contractors, or scientific and other advisors may unintentionally or willfully disclose our information to competitors. If we were to attempt to enforce a claim that a third-party had illegally obtained and was using our trade secrets, it could be expensive and time consuming, and the outcome could be unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the United States are sometimes less willing to protect trade secrets than courts inside the United States. Moreover, if our competitors independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how, it may be difficult for us to enforce our intellectual property and our business could be harmed.\nIf we are not able to defend the patent or trade secret protection position of our products and technologies, then we may not be able to exclude competitors from developing or marketing competing products, and we may not generate enough revenue from product sales to justify the cost of development of our products and to achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe may be unable to protect the intellectual property rights of the third parties from whom we license certain of our intellectual property or with whom we have entered into other strategic relationships, which could negatively impact our competitive advantage.\nWe do not presently have significant intellectual property rights licensed from third parties but, in the future, we may have to license intellectual property from key strategic partners. We may become reliant upon such third parties to protect their intellectual property rights to any licensed technology. Such third parties may not protect the intellectual property rights that we license from them and we may be unable defend such intellectual property rights on our own or we may have to undertake costly litigation to defend the intellectual property rights of such third parties. There can be no assurances that we will continue to have proprietary rights to any of the intellectual property that we license from such third parties or otherwise have the right to use through similar strategic relationships. Any loss or limitations on use with respect to our right to use such intellectual property licensed from third parties or otherwise obtained from third parties or with whom we have entered into strategic relationships could negatively impact our competitive advantage.\nWe expect intense competition in our target markets, which could render our products and/or technologies obsolete, result in significant price reductions or substantially limit the volume of products that we sell. This would limit our ability to compete and achieve and maintain profitability. If we cannot continuously develop and commercialize new products, our revenue may not grow as intended.\nFuture competition will likely come from existing competitors as well as other companies seeking to develop new technologies for analyzing genetic information, such as next generation sequencing. Some of our competitors have various products and/or methodologies for gene detection, expression, characterization, and/or analyses that may be competitive with our products and/or methodologies. In addition, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have significant needs for genomic information and may choose to develop or acquire competing technologies to meet those needs. In the molecular diagnostics field, competition will likely come from established diagnostic companies, companies developing and marketing DNA probe tests for genetic and other diseases and other companies conducting research on new technologies to ascertain and analyze genetic information. Further, in the event that we develop new technology and products that compete with existing technology and products of well-established companies, there can be no guarantee that the marketplace will readily adopt any such new technology and products that we may introduce in the future.\nThe market for genetic research and molecular diagnostic products is highly competitive, with several large companies already having significant market share. Established genetic research and diagnostic companies also have an installed base of instruments in several markets, including clinical and reference laboratories. In addition, these companies have formed alliances with genomics companies that provide them access to genetic information that may be incorporated into their diagnostic tests. We may not be able to compete effectively with these companies.\nOur manufacturing capacity may limit our ability to sell our products.\nThere are uncertainties inherent in expanding our manufacturing capabilities and we may not be able to increase our capacity in a timely manner. For example, manufacturing and product quality issues may arise as we increase production rates at our manufacturing facility and launch new products. As a result, we may experience difficulties in meeting customer demand, in which case we could lose customers or be required to delay new product introductions, and demand for our products could decline. Due to the intricate nature of manufacturing products, we may encounter similar or previously unknown manufacturing difficulties in the future that could significantly reduce production yields, impact our ability to launch or sell these products, or to produce them economically, prevent us from achieving expected performance levels or cause us to set prices that hinder wide adoption by customers.\nIf we are unable to develop and maintain our manufacturing capability, we may not be able to launch or support our products in a timely manner, or at all.\nWe currently possess only one facility capable of manufacturing our products and services for both sale to our customers and internal use. If a natural disaster were to significantly damage our facility or if other events were to cause our operations to fail, these events could prevent us from developing and manufacturing our products and services. If our networks or storage infrastructure were to fail for an extended period of time, it would adversely impact our ability to manufacture our products on a timely basis and may prevent us from achieving our expected shipments in any given period.\nOur reliance on outside manufacturers and suppliers to provide certain instruments could subject us to risks that may harm our business.\nFrom time to time we may change manufacturers, and any new manufacturer engaged by us may not perform as expected. If our vendors experience shortages or delays in their manufacture of our instruments, or if we experience quality problems with our vendors, then our shipment schedules could be significantly delayed or costs significantly increased. Certain of our instruments may be manufactured by a single vendor, which could magnify the risk of shortages.\nWe may be adversely affected by environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and liabilities.\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state and municipal environmental, health and safety laws based on our use of hazardous materials in both our manufacturing and research and development operations. These laws and regulations often require expensive compliance procedures or operational changes to limit actual or potential impacts to the environment. A violation of these laws and regulations can result in substantial fines, criminal sanctions and/or operational shutdown. Furthermore, we may become liable for the investigation and cleanup of environmental contamination, whether intentional or unintentional, and we could be responsible for damages related to the clean-up of such contamination or individual injury caused by such contamination. We may also be subject to related claims by private parties alleging property damage and personal injury due to exposure to hazardous or other materials as a result of such contamination. Some of these matters may require expending significant amounts for investigation, cleanup or other costs. Events such as these could negatively impact our financial position.\nOur sales, marketing and technical support organization may limit our ability to sell our products.\nWe currently have limited resources available for sales, marketing and technical support services as compared to some of our primary competitors. In order to effectively commercialize our genetic analysis systems and other products to follow, we will need to expand our sales, marketing and technical support staff both domestically and internationally. We may not be successful in establishing or maintaining either a direct sales force or distribution arrangements to market our products and services. In addition, we compete primarily with much larger companies that have larger sales and distribution staffs and a significant installed base of products in place, and the efforts of a limited sales and marketing force may not be sufficient to build the market acceptance of our products required to support continued growth of our business.\nWe may be exposed to liability due to product defects.\nThe risk of product liability claims is inherent in the testing, manufacturing, marketing and sale of research products for therapeutic and diagnostic development. We may seek to acquire additional insurance for clinical liability risks. We may not be able to obtain such insurance or general product liability insurance on acceptable terms or in sufficient amounts. A product liability claim or recall could negatively impact our financial position.\nWe may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions, and integration of these acquisitions may disrupt our business and management.\nIn January 2014, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with IntegenX, pursuant to which we acquired substantially all of the assets of the Apollo Business (a product line used in connection with developing, manufacturing, marketing and selling instruments and reagents relating to library preparation for next generation sequencing, including the Apollo 324\u2122 instrument and the PrepX\u2122 reagents). In the future we may acquire additional companies, product lines, or technologies or enter into joint ventures or other strategic initiatives. We may not realize the anticipated benefits of this acquisition or any other future acquisition and any acquisition has numerous risks. These risks include the following: difficulty in assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired company; difficulty in effectively integrating the acquired technologies or products with our current products and technologies; difficulty in maintaining controls, procedures, and policies during the transition and integration; disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of our management and employees from other opportunities and challenges due to integration issues; difficulty integrating the acquired company\u2019s accounting, management information, and other administrative systems; inability to retain key technical and sales personnel of the acquired business; inability to retain key customers, vendors, and other business partners of the acquired business; inability to achieve the financial and strategic goals for the acquired and combined businesses; incurring acquisition-related costs or amortization costs for acquired intangible assets that could impact our operating results; potential failure of the due diligence processes to identify significant issues with product quality, legal and financial liabilities, among other things; potential inability to assert\nthat internal controls over financial reporting are effective. Mergers and acquisitions of companies are inherently risky, and ultimately, if we do not complete the integration of the acquired business successfully and in a timely manner, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions to the extent anticipated, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nOur success depends upon the continued emergence and growth of markets for analysis of genetic variation and biological function.\nWe design our products primarily for applications in the life sciences and pharmaceutical industries. The usefulness of our technology depends in part upon the availability of genetic data and its usefulness in identifying or treating disease. We are initially focusing on markets for analysis of genetic variation and biological function, namely gene expression profiling. This market is new and emerging, and may not develop as quickly as we anticipate, or reach its full potential. Other methods of analysis of genetic variation and biological function may emerge and displace the methods we are developing. Also, researchers may not seek or be able to convert raw genetic data into medically valuable information through the analysis of genetic variation and biological function. In addition, factors affecting research and development spending generally, such as changes in the regulatory environment affecting life sciences and pharmaceutical companies, and changes in government programs that provide funding to companies and research institutions, could harm our business. If useful genetic data is not available or if our target markets do not develop in a timely manner, demand for our products may grow at a slower rate than we expect, and we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe may not be able to deliver acceptable products to our customers due to the rapidly evolving nature of genetic sequence information upon which our products are based.\nThe genetic sequence information upon which we may rely to develop and manufacture our products is contained in a variety of public and private databases throughout the world. These databases are rapidly expanding and evolving. In addition, the accuracy of such databases and resulting genetic research is dependent on various scientific interpretations, and it is not expected that global genetic research efforts will result in standardized genetic sequence databases for particular genomes in the near future.\nAlthough we have implemented ongoing internal quality control efforts to help ensure the quality and accuracy of our products, the fundamental nature of our products requires us to rely on genetic sequence databases and scientific interpretations which are continuously evolving. As a result, these variables may cause us to develop and manufacture products that incorporate sequence errors or ambiguities. The magnitude and importance of these errors depends on multiple and complex factors that would be considered in determining the appropriate actions required to remedy any inaccuracies. Our inability to timely deliver acceptable products as a result of these factors would likely adversely affect our relationship with customers, and could negatively impact our financial condition.\nWe face risks associated with technological obsolescence and emergence of standardized systems for genetic analysis.\nHigh throughput genetic analyses and quantitative detection methodologies (including, for example, PCR) are undergoing rapid evolution and technological changes. New technologies, techniques or products could emerge which might allow the packaging and analysis of genomic information at densities similar to, or even higher than, our existing or future technology. Other companies may begin to offer products that are directly competitive with, or are technologically superior to, our products. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our technological advantages over emerging technologies in the future. Over time, we will need to respond to technological innovation in a rapidly changing industry. Standardization of tools and systems for genetic research is still ongoing and there can be no assurance that our products will emerge as the standard for genetic research. The emergence of competing technologies and systems as market standards for genetic research may result in our products becoming uncompetitive which would have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur success depends on the continuous development of new products and our ability to manage the transition from our older products to new products.\nWe compete in markets that are new, intensely competitive, highly fragmented and rapidly changing, and many of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do. In addition, many current and potential competitors have greater name recognition, more extensive customer bases and access to\nproprietary genetic content. The continued success of our products will depend on our ability to produce products with smaller feature sizes and create greater information capacity at our current or lower costs. The successful development, manufacture and introduction of our new products is a complicated process and depend on our ability to manufacture and supply enough products in sufficient quantity and quality and at acceptable cost in order to meet customer demand. If we fail to keep pace with emerging technologies or are unable to develop, manufacture and introduce new products, we will become uncompetitive, our pricing and margins will decline, and our business will suffer.\nOur failure to successfully manage the transition between our older products and new products may adversely affect our financial results. As we introduce new or enhanced products, we must successfully manage the transition from older products to minimize disruption in customers\u2019 ordering patterns, avoid excessive levels of older product inventories and provide sufficient supplies of new products to meet customer demands. When we introduce new or enhanced products, we face numerous risks relating to product transitions, including the inability to accurately forecast demand and difficulties in managing different sales and support requirements due to the type or complexity of the new products.\nEthical, legal and social concerns surrounding the use of genetic information could reduce demand for our products.\nGenetic testing has raised ethical issues regarding privacy and the appropriate uses of the resulting information. For these reasons, governmental authorities and others may call for limits on or regulation of the use of genetic testing or prohibit testing for genetic predisposition to certain conditions, particularly for those that have no known cure. Similarly, such concerns may lead individuals to refuse to use genetics tests even if permissible. Any of these scenarios could reduce the potential markets for our products.\nRisks Related to Our Organization\nEven though we are not a California corporation, our common stock could still be subject to a number of key provisions of the California General Corporation Law.\nUnder Section 2115 of the California General Corporation Law (\u201cCGCL\u201d), corporations not organized under California law may still be subject to a number of key provisions of the CGCL. This determination is based on whether the corporation has significant business contacts with California and if more than 50% of its voting securities of record are held by persons having addresses in California. In the immediate future, the majority of our business operations, revenue and payroll will be conducted in, derived from, and paid to residents of California. Therefore, depending on our ownership, we could be subject to some provisions of the CGCL. Among the more important provisions are those relating to the election and removal of directors, cumulative voting, standards of liability and indemnification of directors, distributions, dividends and repurchases of shares, stockholder meetings, approval of some corporate transactions, dissenters\u2019 and appraisal rights, and inspection of corporate records. If we are required to comply with these provisions, this compliance could cause us to incur additional administrative and legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s time and attention from the operation of our business.\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert our management\u2019s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), and are required to comply with the applicable requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and other applicable securities rules and regulations. We are subject to the Nasdaq Capital Market\u2019s rules and regulations. Compliance with these rules and regulations have increased our legal and financial compliance costs, made some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and increased demand on our systems and resources. Among other things, the Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and results of operations and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting. In order to maintain and, if required, improve our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting to meet this standard, significant resources and management oversight may be required. As a result, management\u2019s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could harm our business and results of operations. Although we currently employ staff to comply with these requirements, we may need to hire even more employees in the future, which will increase our costs and expenses.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur stock price could be volatile.\nThe market price of the common stock has fluctuated significantly since it was first quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board on June 6, 2007. Since this date, through December 31, 2014, the intra-day trading price has fluctuated from a low of $2.85 to a high of $3,130.79. The price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate significantly in response to factors, some of which are beyond our control, including the following:\n\u00b7\nactual or anticipated variations in operating results;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the economic performance and/or market valuations of other life science companies;\n\u00b7\nour announcement of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u00b7\nadditions or departures of key personnel; and\n\u00b7\nsales or other transactions involving our capital stock.\nEven with our common stock being traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market, there can be no assurance that investors will be interested in purchasing our common stock when our stockholders want to dispose of their shares or at prices that are attractive to our stockholders.\nAlthough our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market, there can be no assurance that we will continue to meet the requirements for our common stock will continue to trade on this exchange.\nSince our Nasdaq listing application was approved effective August 22, 2014, we are required to comply with certain Nasdaq listing requirements, including, without limitation, with respect to our corporate governance, finances, stock trading volume and stock price. If we fail to meet any of these requirements, our shares could be delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market, and we could expect a significant decline in the liquidity of our stock. In the month ended September 30, 2014, when our common stock was traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market, the daily trading volume for shares of our common stock ranged from 2,606 to 40,229 shares traded per day, and the average daily trading volume during such one-month period was 15,825 shares. This compares to the three-month period ended June 30, 2014, when our common stock was traded on the over-the-counter market and was quoted on the OTCQB. In this period, the daily trading volume for shares of our common stock ranged from 0 to 2,577 shares traded per day, and the average daily trading volume during such three-month period was 200 shares, with no shares traded on 31 of the 63 trading days.\nStockholders may experience dilution of their ownership interests because of the future issuance of additional shares of our common stock and our preferred stock.\nIn the future, we may issue our authorized but previously unissued equity securities, resulting in the dilution of the ownership interests of our present stockholders. We are authorized to issue an aggregate of 310,000,000 shares of capital stock consisting of 300,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of which 5,659,768 shares were issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2014, and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share, of which 3,663 are designated as Series 1 Convertible Preferred Stock, none of which were issued and outstanding. The Series 1 Convertible Preferred Stock has no voting rights and a liquidation preference of $0.001 per share. Future issuances of preferred stock will have preferences and rights as may be determined by our board of directors at the time of issuance. Specifically, our board of directors has the authority to issue preferred stock without further stockholder approval. As a result, our board of directors could authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock that would grant to holders the preferred right to our assets upon liquidation, the right to receive dividend payments before dividends are distributed to the holders of common stock and the right to the redemption of the shares, together with a premium, prior to the redemption of common stock. In addition, our board of directors could authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock that has greater voting power than our common stock or that is convertible into common stock, which could decrease the relative voting power of the common stock or result in dilution to our existing stockholders.\nIn addition, as of December 31, 2014, we had notes in favor of Malaysian Technology Development Corporation Sdn. Bhd. (\u201cMTDC\u201d) outstanding with a face value of $5.2 million which we could have settled by issuing an aggregate of 1,528,558 shares of our common stock, and we had 225,000 outstanding restricted stock units, outstanding options to purchase an aggregate of 187,212 shares of our common stock, outstanding unit warrants to purchase 64,700 shares of our common stock\nand 32,350 warrants to purchase shares of our common stock, and outstanding warrants to purchase an aggregate of 5,344,007 shares of our common stock. The future vesting or exercise of these securities will subject our existing stockholders to experience dilution of their ownership interests.\nWe may also issue additional shares of common stock or other securities that are convertible into or exercisable for common stock in connection with hiring or retaining employees, future acquisitions, future sales of our securities for capital raising purposes, or for other business purposes. The future issuance of any additional shares of our common stock may create downward pressure on the trading price of our common stock. There can be no assurance that we will not be required to issue additional shares, warrants or other convertible securities in the future in conjunction with any capital raising efforts, including at a price (or exercise prices) below the price at which shares of our common stock are then traded.\nOur principal stockholders have significant voting power and may take actions that may not be in the best interests of other stockholders.\nOur principal stockholder owns 25% of our outstanding common stock, in addition to which we have two stockholders that each own 10% and one stockholder that owns 9%. If all of these security holders act together, they will be able to exert significant control over our management and affairs requiring stockholder approval, including approval of significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control and might adversely affect the market price of our common stock. This concentration of ownership may not be in the best interests of all our stockholders.\nStockholders should not anticipate receiving cash dividends on our common stock.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends or distributions on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain future earnings to support operations and to finance expansion and therefore do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.", "PERMNO": 14880, "SIC": 2835, "TIC": "WGBS"}
