{"cik": "1536035", "company": "Roundy's, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-13", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nThere are risks and uncertainties that can affect our business, financial condition and results of operation, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from those indicated by forward looking statements included within this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and within other filings with the SEC,\nnews releases, registration statements and other written communication. Any of these risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, which in turn could materially and adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nRisks Related to our Business\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry.\nThe retail food industry as a whole, and our marketing areas in Wisconsin and Chicago, are highly competitive. We compete with various types of retailers, including national, regional and local conventional supermarkets, national and regional supercenters, membership warehouse clubs, and other alternative food retailers, such as natural foods stores, smaller specialty stores and farmers\u2019 markets.\nOur principal competitors include national conventional supermarkets such as New Albertson\u2019s, Inc. (operating under the Jewel/Osco banner); national supercenters such as Costco, Target and Wal-Mart; regional supercenters such as Woodman\u2019s and Meijer\u2019s; regional supermarkets such as Festival Foods, Piggly Wiggly and Hy-Vee, Inc.; alternative food retailers such as Aldi, Trader Joe\u2019s and Whole Foods; and local supermarkets, natural foods stores, smaller specialty stores and farmers\u2019 markets. In general, we compete with Aldi, Costco, Target, Wal-Mart, Trader Joe\u2019s and Whole Foods across all of our geographic markets. Our remaining principal competitors within each of our geographic markets vary to a significant degree and include the following:\n\u2022\nWisconsin: Festival Foods, Piggly Wiggly, Woodman\u2019s and Hy-Vee, Inc.;\n\u2022\nChicago: Jewel/Osco, Meijer\u2019s, and Strack & Van Til.\nSome of these competitors have attempted to increase market share by expanding their footprints in our marketing areas. This competitor expansion creates a more difficult competitive environment for us. We also face limited competition from restaurants and fast-food chains. In addition, other established food retailers could enter our markets, increasing competition for market share.\nWe compete with other food retailers primarily on the basis of product selection and quality, price, customer service, store format and location or a combination of these factors. Pricing in particular is a significant driver of consumer choice in our industry and we regularly engage in price competition. To the extent that our competitors lower prices, our ability to maintain gross profit margins and sales levels may be negatively impacted. We expect competitors to continue to apply pricing and other competitive pressures. Some of our competitors have greater resources than we do and do not have unionized work forces, which may result in lower labor and benefit costs. These competitors could use these advantages to take measures, including reducing prices, which could materially adversely affect our competitive position, our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition to price competitiveness, our success depends on our ability to offer products that appeal to our customers\u2019 preferences. Failure to offer such products, or to accurately forecast changing customer preferences, could lead to a decrease in the number of customer transactions at our stores and a decrease in the amount customers spend when they visit our stores. We also attempt to create a convenient and appealing shopping experience for our customers in terms of customer service, store format and location. If we do not succeed in offering attractively priced products that consumers want to buy or are unable to provide a convenient and appealing shopping experience, our sales, operating margins and market share may decrease, resulting in reduced profitability.\nEconomic conditions that impact consumer spending could materially affect our business.\nOngoing economic uncertainty continues to negatively affect consumer confidence and discretionary spending. Our results of operations may be materially affected by changes in economic conditions nationwide or in the regions in which we operate that impact consumer confidence and spending, including discretionary spending. This risk may be exacerbated if customers choose lower-cost alternatives to our product offerings in response to economic conditions. In particular, a decrease in discretionary spending could adversely impact sales of certain\nof our higher margin product offerings. Future economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income, such as employment levels, business conditions, changes in housing market conditions, the availability of credit, interest rates, tax rates and fuel and energy costs, could reduce overall consumer spending or cause consumers to shift their spending to lower-priced competitors. In addition, inflation or deflation can impact our business. Food deflation could reduce sales growth and earnings, while food inflation, combined with reduced consumer spending, could reduce gross profit margins. As a result, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nThe geographic concentration of our stores creates an exposure to local economies and regional downturns that may materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nAs of January 3, 2015, we operated 119 stores in Wisconsin, making Wisconsin our largest market with 80% of our stores. Of our Wisconsin stores, 57, or approximately one-half, are located in the Milwaukee area. Our business is closely linked to local economic conditions in those areas and, as a result, we are vulnerable to economic downturns in those regions. In addition, any other factors that negatively affect these areas could materially adversely affect our revenues and profitability. These factors could include, among other things, changes in regional demographics, population and employer base. Any of these factors may disrupt our businesses and materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to maintain or improve levels of same-store sales, which could harm our business and cause our stock price to decline.\nWe may not be able to maintain or improve our current levels of same-store sales. Our same-store sales have fluctuated in the past and will likely fluctuate in the future. A variety of factors affect our same-store sales, including:\n\u2022\noverall economic trends and conditions;\n\u2022\nconsumer preferences, buying trends and spending levels;\n\u2022\nour competition, including competitor store openings or closings near our stores;\n\u2022\nthe pricing of our products, including the effects of inflation or deflation;\n\u2022\nthe number of customer transactions in our stores;\n\u2022\nour ability to provide product offerings that generate new and repeat visits to our stores;\n\u2022\nthe level of customer service that we provide in our stores;\n\u2022\nour in-store merchandising-related activities;\n\u2022\nour ability to source products efficiently; and\n\u2022\nthe number of stores we open, remodel or relocate in any period.\nAdverse changes in these factors may cause our same-store sales results to be materially lower than in recent periods, which would harm our business and could result in a decline in the price of our common stock.\nWe may be unable to maintain our operating margins.\nWe intend to maintain our operating margins in an environment of increased competition through various initiatives, including expansion of our own-brand offerings, increased sales of perishables and prepared foods, improved ordering, and strategic remodels and relocations of our stores, as well as continued cost discipline focused on improving labor productivity and reducing inventory shrink. If competitive pressures cause us to lower our prices, our operating margins may decrease. If customers do not adopt our increased own-brand, perishable or prepared food offerings, these higher margin items will not improve our operating margins. If we\ndo not adequately refine and improve our various ordering, tracking and allocation systems, we may not be able to increase sales and reduce inventory shrink. Any failure to achieve gains in labor productivity may adversely impact our operating margins. As a result, our operating margins may stagnate or decline.\nProlonged labor disputes with unionized employees and increases in labor costs could adversely affect us.\nOur largest operating costs are attributable to labor costs and, therefore, our financial performance is greatly influenced by increases in wage and benefit costs, including pension and health care costs. As a result, we are exposed to risks associated with a competitive labor market and, more specifically, to any disruption of our unionized work force.\nAs of January 3, 2015, approximately 62% of our employees were represented by unions and covered by collective bargaining or similar agreements that are subject to periodic renegotiation. Our renegotiation of expiring collective bargaining agreements and negotiation of new collective bargaining agreements may not prove successful, may result in a significant increase in labor costs, or may result in a disruption to our operations. We expect that we would incur additional costs and face increased competition if we lost customers during a work stoppage or labor disturbance.\nAs of January 3, 2015, we had an aggregate of 43 collective bargaining agreements in effect, all of which are scheduled to expire between 2015 and 2019. As of January 3, 2015, there were no employees operating under an expired collective bargaining agreement.\nIn the renegotiation of our current contracts and the negotiation of our new contracts, rising health care and pension costs and the nature and structure of work rules will be important issues. The terms of the renegotiated collective bargaining agreements could create either a financial advantage or disadvantage for us as compared to our major competitors and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Our labor negotiations may not conclude successfully and work stoppages or labor disturbances could occur. A prolonged work stoppage affecting a substantial number of stores could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We also expect that in the event of a work stoppage or labor disturbance, we could incur additional costs and face increased competition for customers.\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act may materially increase our costs and/or make it harder for us to compete as an employer.\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act imposes new mandates on employers, including a requirement effective January 1, 2015 that employers with 50 or more full-time employees provide \u201ccredible\u201d health insurance to employees or pay a financial penalty. Given our generally low-wage workforce and our current health plan design, and assuming the law is implemented without significant changes, these mandates could materially increase our costs. Moreover, if we choose to opt out of offering health insurance to our employees, we may become less attractive as an employer and it may be harder for us to compete for qualified employees.\nWe may not be able to successfully implement our expansion into the Chicago market, which could limit our prospects for future growth.\nOur ability to continue to expand into the Chicago market with a new format of stores under our Mariano\u2019s banner is an important component of our business strategy. Successful execution of this expansion depends upon, among other things:\n\u2022\nthe levels of sales and profitability of Mariano\u2019s stores;\n\u2022\nthe hiring, training and retention of skilled store personnel and management;\n\u2022\nthe incorporation of new Mariano\u2019s stores into our existing distribution network;\n\u2022\nthe negotiation of acceptable lease terms for store sites;\n\u2022\nthe effective management of inventory to meet the needs of our stores on a timely basis;\n\u2022\nthe availability of levels of cash flow or financing necessary to support our expansion; and\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully address competitive pricing, merchandising, distribution and other challenges encountered in connection with expansion into the Chicago market.\nWe, or our third-party vendors, may not be able to adapt our distribution, management information and other operating systems to adequately supply products to new stores at competitive prices so that we can operate the stores in a successful and profitable manner. Additionally, our expansion into the Chicago market will place increased demands on our operational, managerial and administrative resources. These increased demands could cause us to operate our existing business less effectively, which in turn could cause deterioration in the financial performance of our existing stores.\nIn addition, new stores build their sales volume and their customer base over time and, as a result, generally have lower gross margin rates and higher operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, than our more mature stores. If our Chicago market stores do not generate sufficient revenue or operate with acceptable margins, or if we experience an overall decline in performance, we may slow or discontinue our expansion plans, or we may decide to close stores in Chicago or elsewhere. We believe that the competitive dynamics in Chicago are currently favorable for our expansion into the market, but to the extent these conditions change, on account of competitors reacting to our entrance or otherwise, our growth may be inhibited. If we fail to successfully implement our expansion into Chicago, our growth prospects will be materially limited.\nWe may not realize all of the expected benefits from the Chicago Stores Acquisition.\nWe believe that the Chicago Stores Acquisition will enable us to increase our market share in the Chicago area and continue to grow a unique brand in that market. The Chicago Stores Acquisition is the first expansion of Mariano\u2019s through the purchase of existing store locations, and represents the largest simultaneous expansion of Mariano\u2019s store locations to date. Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the Chicago Stores Acquisition depends, to a large extent, on our ability to implement the Mariano\u2019s store concept, support a larger number of stores with our existing supply chain operations and continue to provide a unique shopper experience. Our management will be required to devote significant attention and resources to these efforts, which may disrupt the operations at our existing stores and, if executed ineffectively, could preclude realization of the full benefits we expect. Failure to realize the anticipated benefits of this investment could cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in our operations. In addition, the efforts required to realize the benefits of this Chicago Stores Acquisition may result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses, loss of customer relationships, and the diversion of management\u2019s attention, and may have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nIncreased commodity prices and availability of commodities may impact our profitability.\nMany of our products include ingredients such as wheat, corn, oils, milk, sugar, proteins, cocoa and other commodities. Commodity prices worldwide have generally been increasing. While commodity price inputs do not typically represent the substantial majority of our product costs, any increase in commodity prices may cause our vendors to seek price increases from us. Although we typically are able to mitigate or plan for vendor efforts to increase our costs, we may be unable to continue to do so, either in whole or in part. In the event we are unable to continue mitigating potential vendor price increases, we may in turn consider raising our prices, and our customers may be deterred by any such price increases. Our profitability may be impacted through increased costs to us which may impact gross margins, or through reduced revenue as a result of a decline in the number and average size of customer transactions.\nOur plans to remodel or relocate certain of our existing stores and build new stores in the Chicago market require us to spend capital, which must be allocated among various projects. Failure to use our capital efficiently could have an adverse effect on our profitability.\nWe plan to remodel or relocate certain of our existing stores, and to open additional Mariano\u2019s stores in the Chicago market. These initiatives will use cash generated by our operations. If this cash is not allocated efficiently among these various projects, or if any of these initiatives prove to be unsuccessful, we may experience reduced profitability and we could be required to delay, significantly curtail or eliminate planned store openings, remodels or relocations.\nWe have significant debt service and lease obligations and may incur additional indebtedness in the future which could adversely affect our financial health and our ability to react to changes to our business.\nWe have significant debt service and lease obligations, which could adversely affect our financial health. As of January 3, 2015, we had approximately $659.0 million in total debt and capital lease obligations, including capital lease obligations related to discontinued operations. In addition, we had future minimum lease payment commitments of approximately $2.4 billion at January 3, 2015.\nOur high level of debt and fixed lease obligations will require us to use a significant portion of cash generated by our operations to satisfy these obligations, and could adversely impact our ability to obtain future financing to support our capital expenditures or other operational investments.\nIn Fiscal 2013, we had debt service repayments of $159.3 million and interest payments of $44.8 million. Fiscal 2013 debt service obligations included scheduled repayments on our senior credit facility, as well as an optional prepayment on our senior credit facility of $148.0 million.\nIn Fiscal 2014, we had debt service repayments of $76.4 million and interest payments of $54.8 million. Fiscal 2014 debt service obligations included scheduled repayments on our New Term Facility, as well as the net pay down of $56.9 million resulting from the 2014 Refinancing (as defined herein) and prepayment on our New Term Facility of $13.0 million with proceeds from the sale of our Stevens Point distribution facility.\nIf we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt, we may need to refinance our debt, dispose of assets or issue equity to obtain necessary funds. We do not know whether we will be able to take any of such actions on a timely basis, on terms satisfactory to us or at all. Our level of indebtedness has important consequences. For example, our level of indebtedness may:\n\u2022\nrequire us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay interest and principal on our debt, which would reduce the funds available to us for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, expansion plans and other investments, which may limit our ability to implement our business strategy;\n\u2022\nheighten our vulnerability to downturns in our business, the retail food industry or in the general economy and limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the retail food industry; or\n\u2022\nprevent us from taking advantage of business opportunities as they arise or successfully carrying out our plans to expand our store base and product offerings.\nWe cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future financing will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to make payments on our indebtedness or to fund our operations. In addition, our failure to make payments under our operating leases could trigger defaults under other leases or under agreements governing our other indebtedness, which could cause the counterparties under those agreements to accelerate the obligations due thereunder.\nWe will require substantial cash flows from operations to make our payments under our operating leases. If we are not able to make the required payments under our debt and lease agreements, the lenders or owners of the stores we lease may, among other things, repossess those assets, which could adversely affect our ability to conduct our operations.\nWhile our existing credit facilities (the \u201c2014 Credit Facilities) and the indenture governing the senior secured second lien notes due 2020 (the \u201c2020 Notes\u201d), restrict us and our subsidiaries from incurring additional debt, these restrictions include exceptions that will allow us and our subsidiaries to incur additional debt. If additional debt is issued, the risks described above could intensify.\nThe terms of our credit facilities agreement and indenture governing the notes may restrict our current and future operations, which could adversely affect our ability to respond to changes in our business and to manage our operations.\nThe 2014 Credit Facilities and the indenture governing the 2020 Notes include a number of customary restrictive covenants. These covenants could impair our financing and operational flexibility and make it difficult for us to react to market conditions and satisfy our ongoing capital needs and unanticipated cash requirements. Specifically, such covenants may restrict our ability and, if applicable, the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur additional debt;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments;\n\u2022\nenter into certain types of transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\npay dividends or make other payments by our restricted subsidiaries to us;\n\u2022\nuse assets as security in other transactions;\n\u2022\npay dividends on our common stock or repurchase our equity interests;\n\u2022\nsell certain assets or merge with or into other companies;\n\u2022\nguarantee the debts of others;\n\u2022\nenter into new lines of business;\n\u2022\nmake capital expenditures;\n\u2022\nprepay, redeem or exchange or debt; and\n\u2022\nform any joint ventures or subsidiary investments.\nOur failure to comply with the restrictive covenants described above as well as the terms of any future indebtedness we may incur from time to time could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived by lenders, could result in our being required to repay those borrowings before their due date. If we are forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nProposed changes to financial accounting standards could require our store leases to be recognized on the balance sheet.\nIn addition to our significant level of indebtedness, we have significant obligations relating to our current operating leases. Proposed changes to financial accounting standards could require such leases to be recognized on the balance sheet. As of January 3, 2015, we had undiscounted operating lease commitments of approximately $2.4 billion, scheduled through 2035, related primarily to our stores. These leases are classified as operating leases and disclosed in Note 13 to our audited consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8 - Financial\nStatements and Supplementary Data below, but are not reflected as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. As of January 3, 2015, substantially all our stores were subject to leases, which have terms generally up to 20 years, and during Fiscal 2014 our operating lease expense from continuing operations was approximately $132.2 million.\nIn August 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) and the International Accounting Standards Board (\u201cIASB\u201d) issued a joint discussion paper highlighting proposed changes to financial accounting standards for leases. Currently, Accounting Standards Codification 840 (\u201cASC 840\u201d), Leases (formerly Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 13, Accounting for Leases) requires that operating leases are classified as an off-balance sheet transaction and only the current year operating lease expense is accounted for in the income statement. In order to determine the proper classification of our stores as either operating leases or capital leases, we must make certain estimates at the inception of the lease relating to the economic useful life and the fair value of an asset as well as select an appropriate discount rate to be used in discounting future lease payments. These estimates are utilized by management in making computations as required by existing accounting standards that determine whether the lease is classified as an operating lease or a capital lease. Substantially all of our store leases have been classified as operating leases, which results in rental payments being charged to expense over the terms of the related leases.\nAdditionally, operating leases are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets, which means that neither a leased asset nor an obligation for future lease payments is reflected in our consolidated balance sheets. The proposed changes to ASC 840 would require that substantially all operating leases be recognized as assets and liabilities on our balance sheet. All entities would need to classify leases to determine how to recognize lease-related revenue and expense. Classification would be based on the portion of the economic benefits of the underlying asset expected to be consumed by the lessee over the lease term, for which classification would be based on the nature of the asset being leased. The right to use the leased property would be capitalized as an asset and the present value of future lease payments would be accounted for as a liability. The effective date has not been determined, and may require retrospective adoption. While we have not quantified the impact this proposed standard would have on our financial statements, if our current operating leases are instead recognized on the balance sheet, it will result in a significant increase in the liabilities reflected on our balance sheet and will likely impact our income statement in an amount which cannot be determined at this time.\nCompliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may negatively impact our results of operations and failure to comply may subject us to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of investors\u2019 confidence in our internal control over financial reporting.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSection 404\u201d) requires us and our independent registered accounting firm to perform an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting and file management\u2019s attestation with our Annual Report on Form 10-K each year. We have evaluated, tested and implemented internal controls over financial reporting to enable management to report on such internal controls under Section 404. However, we cannot assure you that the conclusions we reached as of January 3, 2015 will represent conclusions we or our independent registered public accounting firm reach in future periods. Failure on our part to comply with Section 404 may subject us to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence in the reliability of our financial statements. In addition, we may be required to incur costs in improving our internal control over financial reporting and hiring additional personnel. Any such actions could negatively affect our results of operations.\nWe will continue to incur significant increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management will be required to divert attention from operational and other business matters to devote substantial time to public company requirements.\nIn February 2012, we completed an initial public offering. As a result, we are required to incur additional legal, accounting, compliance and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. We are obligated to file with the SEC quarterly and annual information and other reports that are specified in Section 13 and other\nsections of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d). In addition, we are also subject to other reporting and corporate governance requirements, including certain requirements of the New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d), and certain provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (\u201cSarbanes-Oxley\u201d) and other regulations promulgated thereunder, which impose significant compliance obligations upon us. We must be certain that we have the ability to institute and maintain a comprehensive compliance function; establish internal policies; ensure that we have the ability to prepare financial statements that are fully compliant with all SEC reporting requirements on a timely basis; design, establish, evaluate and maintain a system of internal controls over financial reporting in compliance with Sarbanes-Oxley; involve and retain outside counsel and accounting and financial staff with the appropriate experience in connection with the above activities and maintain an investor relations function.\nSarbanes-Oxley, as well as rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and the NYSE, have imposed increased regulation and disclosure and have required enhanced corporate governance practices of public companies. Our efforts to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards in this regard are likely to result in increased administrative expenses and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. These changes require a significant commitment of resources. We may not be successful in implementing or maintaining these requirements, any failure of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, if we fail to implement or maintain the requirements with respect to our internal accounting and audit functions, our ability to continue to report our operating results on a timely and accurate basis could be impaired. If we do not implement or maintain such requirements in a timely manner or with adequate compliance, we might be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC or NYSE. Any such actions could harm our reputation and the confidence of investors and customers in our company and could materially adversely affect our business and cause our share price to fall.\nFailure to attract, train and retain qualified store-level and distribution-level employees could adversely affect our ability to carry out strategic initiatives and ultimately impact our financial performance.\nThe retail food industry is labor intensive. Our ability to meet our labor needs, including our needs for specialized workers, such as pharmacists, while controlling wage and labor-related costs, is subject to numerous external factors, including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force in the markets in which we are located, unemployment levels within those markets, unionization of the available work force, prevailing wage rates, changing demographics, health and other insurance costs and changes in employment legislation. Failure to do so could adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe loss of key employees could negatively affect our business.\nA key component of our success is the experience of our key employees, including our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Robert Mariano, our Executive Vice President-Operations, Donald Rosanova and our Group Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Michael Turzenski. These employees have extensive experience in our industry and are familiar with our business, systems and processes. In addition, Messrs. Mariano and Rosanova are key to our strategy of expansion into the Chicago market, due to their experience with, and understanding of, food retailing in that region. The loss of services of one or more of our key employees could impair our ability to manage our business effectively. We do not maintain key person life insurance on any employee.\nThe cost of providing employee benefits continues to increase and is subject to factors outside of our control.\nWe sponsor defined benefit pension plans, which are frozen with respect to benefit accruals and closed to new participants. Even though our employees are not accruing additional pension benefits under these plans, some of these pension plans are not fully funded. Our funding requirements vary based upon plan asset performance, interest rates and actuarial assumptions. Poorer than assumed asset performance and continuing low interest rates\nwould likely cause our required funding contributions to increase in the future. As of December 28, 2013, the accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for our Company-sponsored defined benefit plans were $179.0 million and $177.0 million, respectively. As of January 3, 2015, the accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for our Company-sponsored defined benefit plans were $217.8 million and $177.1 million, respectively.\nIn addition, we participate in one underfunded multi-employer pension plan on behalf of our union-affiliated supply chain employees, and we are required to make contributions to this plan under our collective bargaining agreement. This multi-employer pension plan is currently underfunded in part due to increases in the costs of benefits provided or paid under these plans as well as lower returns on plan assets over the past several years. The unfunded liability of this plan may result in increased future payments by us and other participating employers. This multi-employer plan in which we participate was deemed by the plan actuary to be in \u201ccritical status,\u201d prompting federally mandated increases in our contributions to them. Going forward, our required contributions to this multi-employer plan could increase as a result of many factors, including the outcome of collective bargaining with the union, actions taken by trustees who manage the plan, government regulations, the actual return on assets held in the plan and the payment of a withdrawal liability if we choose to exit the plan. We expect meaningful increases in contribution expense as a result of required incremental plan contributions to reduce underfunding. Our risk of future increased payments may be greater if other participating employers withdraw from the plan and are not able to pay the total liability assessed as a result of such withdrawal, or if the pension plan adopts surcharges and/or increased pension contributions as part of a rehabilitation plan. For example, in recent years our share of plan underfunding has increased due to the withdrawal of participating employers that, because of their financial distress, were unable to pay contributions or their portion of the unfunded pension liability.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2012, we recognized a charge of $1.0 million related to an expected liability for the withdrawal of approximately 3% of its employees who participate in the United Food and Commercial Workers Unions and Employers Pension Fund (\u201cUFCW Fund\u201d). These employees resumed participation in the UFCW Fund and we therefore recognized a $1.0 million benefit during the third quarter of 2013 related to the reversal of the liability that was established in the fourth quarter of 2012. Subsequent to the withdrawal mentioned below, we no longer participate in this plan.\nDuring Fiscal 2014, we exited the Minneapolis / St. Paul market by selling or closing all of our stores in that market. As a result, we expect to incur a withdrawal liability related to the three multi-employer pension plans in which the affected employees participate. We recorded a charge of $49.7 million for the estimated multi-employer pension withdrawal liability, which represents our best estimate absent demand letters from the multi-employer plans. Demand letters from the impacted multi-employer pension plans may be received in 2015, or later and the ultimate withdrawal liability may change from the currently estimated amount. Any future charge will be recorded in the period when the change is identified. We expect the liability will be paid out in quarterly installments, which vary by plan, over a period of up to 20 years. During the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2014, we received a preliminary notice from one of the plans, which required us to make the first quarterly installment during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2014, and these quarterly installments will continue for 20 years. The amount of the payment was consistent with our estimates when the initial charge was recorded. The net present value of the liability was determined using a risk free interest rate.\nPursuant to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (\u201cERISA\u201d), the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (the \u201cPBGC\u201d) has the right, subject to satisfaction of certain statutory requirements, to involuntarily terminate our defined benefit pension plans (thus accelerating funding obligations), or enter into an alternative arrangement with us to prevent such termination. In March 2010, we were contacted by the PBGC expressing concern regarding the impact that the payment of a $150 million shareholder dividend could have on our ability to meet our obligations to our largest defined benefit pension plan. We subsequently entered into an amendment to our existing agreement with the PBGC that required us to make additional contributions to one of our Company-sponsored defined benefit pension plans, one of which we were required to make no later than\nApril 29, 2010 and one on each of the first two anniversaries thereafter, and for us to increase and continue the credit support in the form of the existing letter of credit with respect to our obligations under such agreement. We completed these steps in accordance with our agreement with the PBGC, and in December 2012 the PBGC agreed that we could reduce the amount of our letter of credit to the previous level. We cannot assure you that the PBGC will not seek to increase or accelerate our funding requirements under our defined benefit plans in the event our operating performance declines or we otherwise increase our indebtedness.\nWe also provide health benefits to substantially all of our full-time employees and to certain part-time employees depending on average hours worked. Even though employees generally pay a portion of the cost, our cost of providing these benefits has increased steadily over the last several years. We anticipate future increases in the cost of health benefits, partly, but not entirely, as a result of the implementation of federal health care reform legislation. If we are unable to control healthcare and pension costs, we may experience increased operating costs, which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nVariability in self-insurance liability estimates could significantly impact our results of operations.\nWe self-insure for workers\u2019 compensation, general liability, automobile liability and employee health care benefits up to a set retention level, beyond which we maintain excess insurance coverage. Liabilities are determined using actuarial estimates of the aggregate liability for claims incurred and an estimate of incurred but not reported claims, on an undiscounted basis. Our accruals for insurance reserves reflect certain actuarial assumptions and management judgments, which are subject to a high degree of variability. The variability is caused by factors external to us such as: historical claims experience; medical inflation; legislative changes to benefit levels; trends relating to jury verdicts; and claim settlement patterns. Any significant variation in these factors could cause a material change to our reserves for self-insurance liabilities and may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nLitigation may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations are characterized by a high volume of customer traffic and by transactions involving a wide variety of product selections. These operations carry a higher exposure to consumer litigation risk when compared to the operations of companies operating in many other industries. Consequently, we may be a party to individual personal injury, product liability and other legal actions in the ordinary course of our business, including litigation arising from food-related illness. The outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits and regulatory actions, is difficult to assess or quantify. Plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. The cost to defend future litigation may be significant. There may also be adverse publicity associated with litigation that may decrease consumer confidence in our businesses, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable. As a result, litigation may materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nVarious aspects of our business are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations. Our compliance with these regulations may require additional capital expenditures and could materially adversely affect our ability to conduct our business as planned.\nWe are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to zoning, land use, environmental protection, work place safety, public health, community right-to-know, alcoholic beverage sales, tobacco sales and pharmaceutical sales. In particular, the states of Wisconsin and Illinois and several local jurisdictions regulate the licensing of supermarkets, including alcoholic beverage license grants. In addition, certain local regulations may limit our ability to sell alcoholic beverages at certain times. A variety of state programs regulate the production and sale of milk, including the price of raw milk, through federal market orders and price support programs. We are also subject to laws governing our relationship with employees, including minimum wage requirements, overtime, working conditions, disabled access and work permit requirements. Compliance with\nnew laws in these areas, or with new or stricter interpretations of existing requirements, could reduce the revenue and profitability of our stores and could otherwise materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Additionally, a number of federal, state and local laws impose requirements or restrictions on business owners with respect to access by disabled persons. Our compliance with these laws may result in modifications to our properties, or prevent us from performing certain further renovations.\nOur pharmacy business is subject to, and influenced by, certain government laws and regulations, including those administered and enforced by Medicare, Medicaid, the Drug Enforcement Administration (the \u201cDEA\u201d), the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. For example, the conversion of various prescription drugs to over-the-counter medications, a decrease in the rate at which new prescription drugs become available or the failed introduction of new prescription drugs into the market could materially adversely affect our pharmacy sales. The withdrawal of certain drugs from the market may also materially adversely affect our pharmacy business. Changes in third party reimbursement levels for prescription drugs, including changes in Medicare or state Medicaid programs, could also reduce our margins and have a material adverse effect on our business. In order to dispense controlled substances, we are required to register our pharmacies with the DEA and to comply with security, recordkeeping, inventory control and labeling standards.\nIn addition, our pharmacy business is subject to local regulations in the states where our pharmacies are located, applicable Medicare and Medicaid regulations and state and federal prohibitions against certain payments intended to induce referrals of patients or other health care business. Failure to properly adhere to these and other applicable regulations could result in the imposition of civil, administrative and criminal penalties including suspension of payments from government programs; loss of required government certifications; loss of authorizations to participate in, or exclusion from, government reimbursement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid; loss of licenses; significant fines or monetary penalties for anti-kickback law violations, submission of false claims or other failures to meet reimbursement program requirements and could materially adversely affect the continued operation of our business. Our pharmacy business is also subject to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, including its obligations to protect the confidentiality of certain patient information and other obligations. Failure to properly adhere to these requirements could result in the imposition of civil as well as criminal penalties.\nWe may experience negative effects to our reputation from real or perceived quality or health issues with our food products, which could have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nWe believe that a reputation for providing our customers with fresh, high-quality food products is an important component of our customer value proposition. Concerns regarding the safety or quality of our food products or of our food supply chain could cause consumers to avoid purchasing certain products from us, or to seek alternative sources of food, even if the basis for the concern is outside of our control. Food products containing contaminants could be inadvertently distributed by us and, if processing at the consumer level does not eliminate them, these contaminants could result in illness or death. Adverse publicity about these concerns, whether or not ultimately based on fact, and whether or not involving products sold at our stores, could discourage consumers from buying our products and have an adverse effect on our operating results. Furthermore, the sale of food products entails an inherent risk of product liability claims, product recall and the resulting negative publicity. Any such claims, recalls or adverse publicity with respect to our own-brand products may have an even greater negative effect on our sales and operating results, in addition to generating adverse publicity for our own-brand products. Any lost confidence in us on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to re-establish. Any such adverse effect could significantly reduce our brand value. Issues regarding the safety of any food items sold by us, regardless of the cause, could have a substantial and adverse effect on our sales and operating results.\nCertain risks are inherent in providing pharmacy services, and our insurance may not be adequate to cover any claims against us.\nPharmacies are exposed to risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other healthcare products, such as risks of liability for products which cause harm to consumers. Although we maintain professional liability insurance and errors and omissions liability insurance, we cannot guarantee that the coverage limits under our insurance programs will be adequate to protect us against future claims, or that we will be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms in the future, or at all. Our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows may be materially adversely affected if in the future our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable, or there is an increase in the liability for which we self-insure, or we suffer harm to our reputation as a result of an error or omission.\nIf our goodwill becomes further impaired, we may be required to record significant charges to earnings in the future.\nWe have a significant amount of goodwill. As of January 3, 2015, we had goodwill of approximately $297.5 million, of which $173.0 million is related to our Wisconsin financial reporting unit and $124.5 million is related to our Illinois financial reporting unit. As of January 3, 2015, goodwill represented approximately 26.6% of our total assets as of such date. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis (as of the first day of the third quarter) or whenever events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of are porting unit below its carrying amount. Fair value is determined based on the discounted cash flows and comparable market value of a reporting unit. An impairment charge is recorded for any excess of the carrying value of goodwill over the implied fair value of the assets and liabilities. Prior to the third quarter of Fiscal 2014, the entire group of company-owned retail stores were considered one reporting unit. Subsequent to the second quarter of Fiscal 2014, we reassessed our determination of reporting units based on the exit from the Minneapolis/St. Paul market, the continued growth of the Mariano\u2019s banner and its management operating structure and determined that we had two financial reporting units. The two financial reporting units identified by us during Fiscal 2014 are related to our business in Wisconsin comprised of the Pick \u2019n Save, Copps and Metro Market banners and our business in Illinois comprised of the Mariano\u2019s banner.\nThe fair value of each reporting unit of the Company is determined by using both the income approach and market approach. The income approach involves discounting management\u2019s projections of future cash flows and a terminal value discounted at a discount rate which approximates the Company\u2019s weighted average cost of capital (\u201cWACC\u201d). Key assumptions used in the income approach include future sales growth and same-store sales, gross margin and operating expenses trends, depreciation expense, taxes, capital expenditures, changes in working capital and discount rate. Projected future cash flows are based on management\u2019s knowledge of the current operating environment and expectations for the future. The internal forecasts used by the Company assume that the Wisconsin market will stabilize and that the Illinois market will experience profitability similar to its Wisconsin stores when the newly opened Mariano\u2019s stores within that market mature. The WACC incorporates equity and debt return rates observed in the market for a group of comparable public companies and is determined using an average debt to equity ratio of selected comparable public companies. The terminal value is based upon the projected cash flow for the final projected year, and is calculated using estimates of growth of the net cash flows based on our estimate of stable growth for each financial reporting unit. The market approach is based upon observed transactions in the marketplace, evidenced by trading multiples based upon estimated and actual sales and EBITDA. The sales and earnings multiples selected by the Company are based upon the average multiples of comparable public companies and then adjusted for factors including forecast risk, growth and profitability.\nDetermining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Determining fair value using an income approach requires that we make significant estimates and assumptions, including management\u2019s long-term projections of cash flows, market conditions and appropriate discount rates. Our judgments are based on historical experience, current market trends and other information. In estimating future cash flows, we rely on internally generated forecasts for operating profits and cash flows, including capital expenditures. The rates used to discount projected future cash flows reflect a weighted average cost of capital\nbased on the our industry, capital structure and risk premiums including those reflected in the current market capitalization, and could change and therefore impact the fair value of our reporting units. Based on our annual impairment testing completed at the beginning of the third quarter of Fiscal 2012, 2013 and 2014, no impairment of goodwill was indicated.\nDuring the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2012, our market capitalization experienced a significant decline. As a result, management believed that there were circumstances evident which indicated that the fair value of our reporting unit could be below its carrying amount. Management therefore updated its annual review of goodwill for impairment that had been completed in the third quarter of 2012 and concluded that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeded its estimated fair value, resulting in a pre-tax, non-cash impairment charge of $120.8 million ($106.4 million, net of income taxes) during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2012.\nIn accordance with our policy, we qualitatively assessed our goodwill balance for indicators of impairment as of the first day of the third quarter of Fiscal 2014. During the third quarter of Fiscal 2014, our market capitalization experienced a sustained significant decline. As a result, management concluded that there were circumstances evident which indicated that the fair value of our reporting units could be below their carrying amounts. Management therefore updated its annual review of goodwill for impairment that had been completed as of the first day of the third quarter of Fiscal 2014 and concluded that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeded its estimated fair value, resulting in a pre-tax, non-cash impairment charge of $280.0 million ($247.1 million, net of income taxes) during the third quarter of Fiscal 2014.\nChanges in the key assumptions used to determine fair value, including changes in estimates of future cash flows caused by unforeseen events or changes in market conditions could negatively affect one or both of our reporting units\u2019 fair value and ultimately result in further impairment charges. We continuously monitor for events and circumstances that could negatively impact the key assumptions used in determining fair value of a reporting unit. Factors that could cause us to change our estimates of future cash flows include successful efforts by our competitors to gain market share in our Wisconsin markets resulting in decreased sales and earnings projections for the Wisconsin markets, unsuccessful implementation of our expansion in the Illinois market resulting in less than expected sales and earnings for the Illinois market, an increased competitive environment in any of our markets, our inability to compete effectively with other retailers, our inability to maintain price competitiveness and a deterioration in general economic conditions. Additional changes to the key assumptions that could negatively affect the fair value of our reporting units include changes to discount rates, fluctuations in the valuations of comparable companies and volatility in our stock price. In addition, a reduction in the estimated replacement cost for similar fixed assets could result in a decrease in the estimated fair value of our fixed assets, and declines in the market rents for properties similar to those that we occupy could result in a decrease in the estimated fair value of our intangible lease rights. Please see Results of Continuing Operations for a discussion of any factors that are currently present that may impact the fair value of the Company. An impairment of a significant portion of our goodwill could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nSevere weather, natural disasters and adverse climate changes may materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nSevere weather conditions and other natural disasters in areas where we have stores or distribution facilities or from which we obtain the products we sell may materially adversely affect our retail or distribution operations or our product offerings and, therefore, our results of operations. Such conditions may result in physical damage to, or temporary or permanent closure of, one or more of our stores or distribution facilities, an insufficient work force in our markets, and/or temporary disruption in the supply of products, including delays in the delivery of goods to our stores or a reduction in the availability of products in our stores. In addition, adverse climate conditions and adverse weather patterns, such as drought or flood, that impact growing conditions and the quantity and quality of crops may materially adversely affect the availability or cost of certain products within our supply chain. Any of these factors may disrupt our businesses and materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business could be harmed by a failure of our information technology or administrative systems.\nWe rely on our information technology and administrative systems to effectively manage our business data, communications, supply chain, order entry and fulfillment and other business processes. The failure of our information technology or administrative systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and result in transaction errors, processing inefficiencies and the loss of sales and systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from circumstances beyond our control, including fire, natural disasters, systems failures, viruses and security breaches, including breaches of our transaction processing or other systems that could result in the compromise of confidential customer data. Any such damage or interruption could have a material adverse effect on our business, cause us to face significant fines, customer notice obligations or costly litigation, harm our reputation with our customers, require us to expend significant time and expense developing, maintaining or upgrading our information technology or administrative systems, or prevent us from paying our suppliers or employees, receiving payments from our customers or performing other information technology or administrative services on a timely basis.\nIf we experience a data security breach and confidential customer information is disclosed, we may be subject to penalties and experience negative publicity, which could affect our customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe and our customers could suffer harm if customer information were accessed by third parties due to a security failure in our systems. The collection of data and processing of transactions require us to receive and store a large amount of personally identifiable data. This type of data is subject to legislation and regulation in various jurisdictions. Recently, data security breaches suffered by well-known companies and institutions have attracted a substantial amount of media attention, prompting state and federal legislative proposals addressing data privacy and security. If some of the current proposals are adopted, we may be subject to more extensive requirements to protect the customer information that we process in connection with the purchases of our products. We may become exposed to potential liabilities with respect to the data that we collect, manage and process, and may incur legal costs if our information security policies and procedures are not effective or if we are required to defend our methods of collection, processing and storage of personal data. Future investigations, lawsuits or adverse publicity relating to our methods of handling personal data could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows due to the costs and negative market reaction relating to such developments.\nEnergy costs are a significant component of our operating expenses, and increasing energy costs, unless offset by more efficient usage or other operational responses, may impact our profitability.\nWe utilize natural gas and electricity in our stores and distribution facilities and gasoline and diesel fuel in the trucks that deliver products to our stores. Increases in energy costs, whether driven by increased demand, decreased or disrupted supply or an anticipation of any such events, will increase the costs of operating our stores and distribution network and may increase the costs of our products. We may not be able to recover these rising costs through increased prices charged to our customers, and any increased prices may exacerbate the risk of customers choosing lower-cost alternatives. In addition, if we are unsuccessful in protecting against these increases in energy costs through long-term energy contracts, improved energy procurement, improved efficiency and other operational improvements, the overall costs of operating our stores will increase which would impact our profitability.\nWe may be unable to protect or maintain our intellectual property, which could results in customer confusion and adversely affect our business.\nWe believe that our intellectual property has substantial value and has contributed significantly to the success of our business. In particular, our trademarks, including our registered trademarks of Roundy\u2019s and Pick \u2019n Save, and our common law trademarks of Copps and Mariano\u2019s, are valuable assets that reinforce our customers\u2019 favorable perception of our stores. From time to time, third parties have used names similar to ours, have applied\nto register trademarks similar to ours and, we believe, have infringed or misappropriated our intellectual property rights. We respond to these actions on a case-by-case basis. The outcomes of these actions have included both negotiated out-of-court settlements as well as litigation.\nRisks Related to the Ownership of Our Common Stock\nConflicts of interest may arise because some of our directors are representatives of Willis Stein.\nMessrs. Larson and Stein, who are representatives of Willis Stein, serve on our board of directors. Willis Stein and entities controlled by them may hold equity interests in entities that directly or indirectly compete with us, and companies in which they currently invest may begin competing with us. As a result of these relationships, when conflicts between the interests of Willis Stein, on the one hand, and the interests of our other stockholders, on the other hand, arise, these directors may not be disinterested. Although our directors and officers have a duty of loyalty to us under Delaware law and our certificate of incorporation, transactions that we enter into in which a director or officer has a conflict of interest are generally permissible so long as (1) the material facts relating to the director\u2019s or officer\u2019s relationship or interest as to the transaction are disclosed to our board of directors and a majority of our disinterested directors, or a committee consisting solely of disinterested directors, approves the transaction, (2) the material facts relating to the director\u2019s or officer\u2019s relationship or interest as to the transaction are disclosed to our stockholders and a majority of our disinterested stockholders approves the transaction or (3) the transaction is otherwise fair to us. Under our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, representatives of Willis Stein are not required to offer to us any transaction opportunity of which they become aware and could take any such opportunity for themselves or offer it to other companies in which they have an investment, unless such opportunity is offered to them solely in their capacity as a director of ours. Our certificate of incorporation provides that the doctrine of \u201ccorporate opportunity\u201d will not apply to Willis Stein, or any of our directors who are associates of, or affiliated with, Willis Stein, in a manner that would prohibit them from investing in competing businesses or doing business with our clients or guests. It is possible that the interests of Willis Stein and its affiliates may in some circumstances conflict with our interests and the interests of our other stockholders.\nMarket volatility may affect our stock price and the value of your investment.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, most of which we cannot predict or control, including:\n\u2022\nannouncements of new initiatives, commercial relationships, acquisitions or other events by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nfailure of any of our initiatives to achieve commercial success;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in stock market prices and trading volumes of securities of similar companies;\n\u2022\ngeneral market conditions and overall fluctuations in U.S. equity markets;\n\u2022\nvariations in our operating results, or the operating results of our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in our financial guidance to investors and analysts or our failure to achieve such expectations;\n\u2022\ndelays in, or our failure to provide, financial guidance;\n\u2022\nchanges in securities analysts\u2019 estimates of our financial performance or our failure to achieve such estimates;\n\u2022\nfuture changes in our dividend policy;\n\u2022\nsales of large blocks of our common stock, including sales by Willis Stein or by our executive officers or directors;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of any of our key personnel;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting principles or methodologies;\n\u2022\nchanging legal or regulatory developments in the U.S. and other countries; and\n\u2022\ndiscussion of us or our stock price by the financial press and in online investor communities.\nIn addition, the stock market in general has experienced substantial price and volume volatility that is often seemingly unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may cause the trading price of our common stock to decline. In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company after a period of volatility in the market price of its common stock. We may become involved in this type of litigation in the future. Any securities litigation claims brought against us could result in substantial expenses and the diversion of our management\u2019s attention from our business.\nWe do not expect to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future.\nThe continued expansion of the Mariano\u2019s banner will require substantial funding. Accordingly, we do not anticipate that we will pay any cash dividends on shares of our common stock for the foreseeable future. On December 2, 2013, we announced that our Board of Directors suspended the quarterly dividend in order to reallocate capital to execute our Mariano\u2019s banner growth plan. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon results of operations, financial condition, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors our Board of Directors deems relevant. Because we are a holding company, our ability to pay cash dividends on our common stock is largely dependent upon the receipt of dividends or other distributions from our subsidiaries. In addition, we are currently limited in our ability to declare dividends or make distributions on account of our common stock (other than in the form of common stock) under the terms of the 2020 Notes, the 2014 Term Facility and the 2014 Revolving Facility.\nFuture sales of our common stock, or the perception in the public markets that these sales may occur, may depress our stock price.\nAs of February 27, 2015, there were 49,277,943 shares of our common stock outstanding. A large portion of our shares are held by a small number of persons and investment funds. Sales by these stockholders of a substantial number of shares could significantly reduce the market price of our common stock. Moreover, Willis Stein has rights, subject to some conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering the shares they currently hold, or to include these shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders.\nAn aggregate of 5,656,563 shares of our common stock has been registered and reserved for future issuance under the 2012 Incentive Compensation Plan. As of February 27, 2015 there were 2,982,399 remaining shares available for issuance. These shares can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance, subject to satisfaction of applicable vesting provisions. If a large number of these shares are sold in the public market, the sales could reduce the trading price of our common stock.\nOur future operating results may fluctuate significantly and our current operating results may not be a good indication of our future performance. Fluctuations in our quarterly financial results could affect our stock price in the future.\nOur revenues and operating results have historically varied from period-to-period, and we expect that they will continue to do so as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control. If our quarterly financial results or our predictions of future financial results fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors, our stock price could be negatively affected. Any volatility in our quarterly financial results may make it more difficult for us to raise capital in the future or pursue acquisitions that involve issuances of our stock. Our operating results for prior periods may not be effective predictors of our future performance.\nFactors associated with our industry, the operation of our business and the markets for our products may cause our quarterly financial results to fluctuate, including:\n\u2022\nour ability to compete effectively with other retailers;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain price competitiveness;\n\u2022\nongoing economic uncertainty;\n\u2022\nthe geographic concentration of our stores;\n\u2022\nour ability to achieve sustained sales and profitable operating margins at new stores;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain or increase our operating margins;\n\u2022\nour ability to implement our expansion into the Chicago market on a timely basis;\n\u2022\nordering errors or product supply disruptions in the delivery of perishable products;\n\u2022\nincreases in commodity prices;\n\u2022\nour ability to protect or maintain our intellectual property;\n\u2022\nsevere weather, and other natural disasters in areas in which we have stores or distribution facilities;\n\u2022\nthe failure of our information technology or administrative systems to perform as anticipated;\n\u2022\ndata security breaches and the release of confidential customer information;\n\u2022\nour ability to offset increasing energy costs with more efficient usage;\n\u2022\nnegative effects to our reputation from real or perceived quality or health issues with our food products;\n\u2022\nour ability to retain and attract senior management and key employees;\n\u2022\nour ability to renegotiate expiring collective bargaining agreements and new collective bargaining agreements;\n\u2022\nour ability to satisfy our ongoing capital needs and unanticipated cash requirements;\n\u2022\nthe availability of financing to pursue our expansion into the Chicago market on satisfactory terms or at all;\n\u2022\nadditional indebtedness incurred in the future;\n\u2022\nour ability to retain and attract qualified store-and distribution-level employees;\n\u2022\nrising costs of providing employee benefits, including increased pension contributions due to unfunded pension liabilities;\n\u2022\nchanges in law;\n\u2022\nrisks inherent in packaging and distributing pharmaceuticals and other healthcare products;\n\u2022\nwartime activities, threats or acts of terror or a widespread regional, national or global health epidemic;\n\u2022\nchanges to financial accounting standards regarding store leases;\n\u2022\nour high level of fixed lease obligations;\n\u2022\nclaims made against us resulting in litigation; and\n\u2022\nfurther impairment of our goodwill.\nAny one of the factors above or the cumulative effect of some of the factors referred to above may result in significant fluctuations in our quarterly financial and other operating results, including fluctuations in our key metrics. This variability and unpredictability could result in our failing to meet our internal operating plan or the\nexpectations of securities analysts or investors for any period. If we fail to meet or exceed such expectations for these or any other reasons, the market price of our shares could fall substantially and we could face costly lawsuits, including securities class action suits. In addition, a significant percentage of our operating expenses are fixed in nature and based on forecasted revenue trends. Accordingly, in the event of revenue shortfalls, we are generally unable to mitigate the negative impact on margins in the short term.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law might discourage or delay attempts to acquire us that you might consider favorable.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult without the approval of our board of directors. These provisions include:\n\u2022\na classified board of directors so that not all members of our board of directors are elected at one time;\n\u2022\nauthorization of the issuance of undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and the shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval, and which may include super voting, special approval, dividend, or other rights or preferences superior to the rights of the holders of common stock;\n\u2022\nprohibition on stockholder action by written consent unless such action is recommended by either unanimous written consent of the board of directors or by unanimous vote of directors at a board meeting with a quorum, which requires that all stockholder actions not so approved be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nspecial meetings of our stockholders may only be called by a resolution adopted by a majority of our directors then in office or by the chairman;\n\u2022\nexpress authorization for our board of directors to make, alter, or repeal our amended and restated bylaws; and\n\u2022\nadvance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nIn addition, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \u201cDGCL\u201d) which limits the ability of stockholders owning in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock to merge or combine with us. Although we believe these provisions collectively provide for an opportunity to obtain greater value for stockholders by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors, they would apply even if an offer rejected by our board were considered beneficial by some stockholders. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management.\nThese anti-takeover provisions and other provisions under Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions which they may desire.", "PERMNO": 13250, "SIC": 5411, "TIC": "RNDY"}
