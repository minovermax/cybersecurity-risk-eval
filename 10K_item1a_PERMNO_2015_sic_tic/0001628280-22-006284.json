{"cik": "1759008", "company": "CarLotz, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes, before deciding to invest in our securities. If any of the following events occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that adversely affect our business or results of operations.\nSummary Risk Factors\n\u2022General business and economic conditions, and risk to the larger automotive ecosystem, including consumer demand, could adversely affect the market for used vehicles.\n\u2022The continuing semi-conductor chip shortage and COVID-related supply chain issues have impacted, and may continue to impact, our ability to execute on our vehicle sourcing plans and have reduced, and may continue to reduce, our profitability.\n\u2022Sourcing vehicles via competitive or direct purchases exposed us, and may continue to expose us, to additional risks and has increased, and may continue to increase, those risks to which we have been exposed in the past.\n\u2022We may be unable to improve productivity and efficiency at our hubs.\n\u2022We participate in a highly competitive industry and face pressure from existing and new companies.\n\u2022Our business model relies on the willingness of sellers to consign their vehicles with us.\n\u2022Our business is dependent upon us having sufficient and suitable inventory for resale to customers.\n\u2022One or more of our corporate vehicle sourcing partners may represent 10% or more of our total vehicles sold, and at times significantly more, in the normal course of our vehicle sourcing.\n\u2022We are, and may in the future be, subject to legal proceedings in the ordinary course of our business, including claims that may not be covered by our insurers.\n\u2022We have a history of losses and we may not achieve profitability in the future.\n\u2022We may not be able to sustain our revenue growth or effectively manage growth.\n\u2022Our business, financial condition and results of operations have been and will continue to be adversely affected by the recent COVID-19 pandemic.\n\u2022Our ability to maintain and expand our product offerings and introduce additional products and services may be limited.\n\u2022We may experience damage or destruction to, or theft of, the vehicles consigned to us, or our processing centers or retail hubs, business interruptions or other liabilities.\n\u2022Our business is dependent upon us having sufficient and suitable inventory for resale to customers.\n\u2022Our business is sensitive to changes in the prices of new and used vehicles.\n\u2022We faced, and continue to face, a variety of risks associated with our inspection and reconditioning operations.\n\u2022If we fail to implement and maintain an effective system of internal control to remediate our material weaknesses over financial reporting, we may be unable to accurately report our results of operations, meet our reporting obligations as a public company, or prevent fraud.\n\u2022We may fail to adequately protect our intellectual property, technology and confidential information.\nRisks Related to CarLotz\u2019 Business\nGeneral business and economic conditions, and risk to the larger automotive ecosystem, including consumer demand, could adversely affect the market for used vehicles, which could reduce our revenue and profitability.\nThe market for used vehicles in the U.S. is affected by general business and economic conditions, especially as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the global semi-conductor chip shortage, and inflationary pressures. Volatility caused by, among other events, the COVID-19 pandemic, the global semi-conductor chip shortage, and inflationary pressures has resulted in, or may result in, reduced demand for our services, consigned and purchased vehicles and value-added products, reduced spending on vehicles, the inability of customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of vehicles, and decreased consumer confidence to make discretionary purchases. In addition, global inflation has increased during 2021, related to the COVID-19 economic recovery and associated disruptions in global demand, supply, geopolitical events, logistics and labor markets.\nPurchases of used vehicles and the consignment of vehicles for sale are typically discretionary for consumers and have been, and may continue to be, affected by negative trends in the economy and other factors, including the availability of new vehicles, difference between wholesale and retail prices, rising interest rates, the cost of energy and gasoline, changes in consumer behavior, and the availability and cost of consumer credit and reductions in consumer confidence. Fears of recession, stock market volatility, inflationary pressures, inflation and regulations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic may decrease consumer demand and reduce our revenue.\nIn the event of a sustained revenue or earnings decline suffered by participants in the automotive markets, our competitors and car manufacturers may attempt to increase their sales, including by offering increased trade-in values for vehicles, reducing prices or increasing marketing expenditures, each of which may cause potential vehicle sourcing partners to perceive that there are higher value alternatives to selling their vehicles to us or consigning their vehicles with us and which may result in fewer vehicles being available to us on a consignment basis or generally.\nA prolonged economic downturn that results in reduced demand for our services, vehicles and product offerings could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe continuing semi-conductor chip shortage and COVID-related supply chain issues, have impacted, and may continue to impact, our ability to execute on our vehicle sourcing plans and have reduced, and may continue to reduce, our profitability.\nAs the global semi-conductor chip shortage and COVID-related supply chain issues continue to persist, new-vehicle inventory has remained historically low. The low levels of available new-vehicle inventory have reduced the supply of used vehicles in the automotive ecosystem. As a result of the reduced supply of used vehicles, the price of both retail and wholesale vehicles has increased, and wholesale used vehicle prices have experienced a larger percentage increase than used retail pricing during the year ended December 31, 2021 which has reduced the incremental value we can deliver to our corporate vehicle sourcing partners via Retail Remarketing\u2122, and at times made consignment less attractive to partners than quickly selling vehicles through the wholesale channel. As a result, we have experienced constraints, and may continue to experience constraints, on our supply of used vehicles from our corporate vehicle sourcing partners, which has adversely impacted and could continue to adversely impact our ability to execute on vehicle sourcing plans and our sales and profitability. If we are unable to execute on our vehicle sourcing plans to source vehicles non-competitively from our corporate sourcing partners, as we have experienced in 2021, and directly from consumers, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSourcing vehicles via competitive or direct purchases exposed us, and may continue to expose us, to additional risks and has increased, and may continue to increase, those risks to which we have been exposed in the past.\nWhen acquiring vehicles via competitive or direct purchase, we take on all of the risks of ownership of a vehicle. While purchasing a vehicle can provide an opportunity for us to retain higher profits than when selling on behalf of a vehicle consignor, it also exposes us to all of the risks of vehicle ownership, which we experienced at times in 2021. For purchased vehicles, we are not able to enter into any risk sharing arrangement with a vehicle consignor or to share any of the cost of\npreparing the vehicle for sale, whether directly or through fees deducted from the sale proceeds that we deliver to a vehicle consignor. Purchasing vehicles increases the amount of our assets represented by inventory at a given time, which may constrain the amount of inventory we can hold. In general, competitively sourced vehicles are obtained at a higher purchase price than non-competitively sourced vehicles, increasing the chance of selling at reduced profit or a loss, especially during periods when we may be forced to be less selective in our purchases to maintain a sufficient level and variety of inventory, which we experienced at times in 2021 and may continue to experience. Additionally, as we experienced in 2021 and may continue to experience, the longer the vehicle ages, over time the fair value may decrease below cost. Also, purchased vehicles, as compared to non-competitive consignments, result in increased interest expense due to higher borrowings under our floorplan facility. If such conditions were to continue requiring, the company to competitively source vehicles as opposed to non-competitively, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, as we experienced in 2021. In particular, during the year ended December 31, 2021, we were forced to source a greater percentage of our inventory through wholesale purchases, which has exposed, and may continue to expose, our business to these risks.\nOur inability to improve productivity and efficiency at our hubs has materially and adversely affected, and may continue to materially and adversely affect, our revenue, unit sales, gross profit, and growth.\nThe optimization of used vehicle sourcing, reconditioning, and sales is essential to increasing unit sales and gross profit. We have experienced suboptimal levels of productivity and efficiency and our hubs, which has materially and adversely affected our revenue, unit sales, gross profit and growth. If we are unable to improve productivity and efficiency at our hubs, our ability to increase revenue, unit sales and gross profit and to grow our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe participate in a highly competitive industry, and pressure from existing and new companies may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is involved in the sourcing and sale of used vehicles. Used and new car dealerships, companies that provide listings, information and lead generation, as well as car-buying and car-selling services designed to help potential vehicle sellers and buyers and to enable dealers to reach these vehicle sellers and buyers, are sources of significant competition to our business. Some of these companies include:\n\u2022traditional used vehicle dealerships, including those that may increase investment in their technology and infrastructure or leverage original equipment manufacturing services to market and sell used vehicles online;\n\u2022large national car dealers, such as CarMax and AutoNation, which are expanding into online sales, including omni-channel offerings;\n\u2022on-line and physical auction businesses, such as ADESA (which recently signed a definitive agreement to be acquired by Carvana, subject to customary closing conditions), Manheim, ACV, BackLotCars and several smaller independent auctions that compete with us for the supply of our vehicles;\n\u2022sales by rental car companies directly to consumers of used vehicles that were previously utilized in rental fleets, such as Hertz Car Sales and Enterprise Car Sales;\n\u2022used car dealers or marketplaces with e-commerce business or online platforms such as Carvana, Vroom and Shift; and\n\u2022the peer-to-peer used vehicle sales market, utilizing sites such as Google, Facebook, Craigslist.com, eBay Motors and Nextdoor.com.\nWe also expect that new competitors will continue to enter the online and traditional automotive retail industry with competing brands, business models, and products and services. These competitors may include companies who attempt to compete directly with our consignment-to-retail business model which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCompetitors may also attempt to replicate our business model and compete directly with us for the sourcing and sale of used vehicles. These competitors may have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we have, and the ability to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and support of their products and services. Additionally, they may have more extensive automotive industry relationships, longer operating histories and greater name recognition than we have. As a result, these competitors may be able to respond more quickly with new technologies and to undertake more extensive marketing or promotional campaigns. If we are unable to compete with these companies, the demand for our services could substantially decline.\nOur business model relies on the willingness of sellers to consign their vehicles with us.\nOur business depends on our ability to attract consumers to consign with us and cost-effectively attract, retain and grow relationships with corporate vehicle sourcing partners and retail sellers, and in turn, on the supply of used vehicles sold through our marketplace. For the three months and the year ended December 31, 2021, one of our corporate vehicle sourcing partners, with whom we do not have a consignment contract, accounted for 14% and 31%, respectively, of our sold vehicles and 66% and 60%, respectively, of our consigned vehicles. In prior periods such corporate vehicle sourcing partner accounted for a greater percentage of our sourced vehicles, and during 2021 paused its consignment of vehicles with us in May and resumed their consignment with us in September, which had an adverse effect on our business. To expand our consignment base, we must educate consumers on the benefits of the consignment model and appeal to and contract with more local and regional corporate accounts, as well as national accounts, further penetrate existing corporate vehicle sourcing partners\u2019 accounts and engage individuals who may be unfamiliar with our consignment-to-retail marketplace. Our strategy also includes leveraging our existing relationships to further penetrate existing corporate customers and rely on a variety of methods to scale our business in new markets, including traditional advertising, retail signage, targeted sales efforts and word-of-mouth. We have experienced, and may continue to experience, inadequate supply of vehicles from our consignment relationships with consumers and corporate partners, which has required us, and may continue to require us, to acquire vehicles by other means, including through wholesale market purchases, and hold them longer than expected.\nOur business is dependent upon us having sufficient and suitable inventory for resale to customers.\nWe acquire vehicles for sale through numerous sources, both non-competitively and competitively. The supply of vehicles may not be sufficient or suitable to meet our customers\u2019 needs and vehicles may not be available at prices or on terms acceptable to us or profitable to us on resale. In addition, vehicles purchased or consigned by us may turn out not to be the most desirable for our customers in a particular market. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we had a higher mix of dealer-owned inventory acquired from wholesale auctions than expected due to a number of factors such as market conditions, cars available to us, the reduction of vehicles consigned with us from the corporate sourcing vehicle partner that paused consignments with us during a portion of the year and the purchases from auction of vehicles for our new hubs. Some of that inventory was not profitable to us and was held for sale longer than desired. Not having sufficient or suitable inventory as we experienced in 2021 and may experience in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d for additional details.\nOne or more of our corporate vehicle sourcing partners may represent 10% or more of our total vehicles sold, and at times significantly more, in the normal course of our vehicle sourcing.\nOne or more of our corporate vehicle sourcing partners will often represent 10% or more of the vehicles we sell over a particular period. For example, for the three months and the year ended December 31, 2021, one of our corporate vehicle sourcing partners accounted for 14% and 31%, respectively, of our sold vehicles and 66% and 60%, respectively, of our consigned vehicles. Over time, we may have concentrations of 10% or more for a number of reasons and the concentrations will often vary among corporate vehicle sourcing partners. Some corporate vehicle sourcing partners may make a supply of vehicles available at certain times of a given year, while others may increase or decrease their flow of vehicles for a number of reasons, including the performance of their business or prevailing business considerations and economic conditions, or in their discretion.\nFurthermore, at times, we may source a significantly higher portion of our consigned vehicles from one or more corporate vehicle sourcing partners. For example, the corporate vehicle sourcing partner that accounted for 31% of the cars we sold during the year ended December 31, 2021 paused their consignment with us from May and resumed their consignment with us in September, such pause having an adverse effect on our business. Such concentrations can result from a variety of factors, some of which are beyond our control. During any given time period, we may elect to source a higher percentage of vehicles from one or more corporate vehicle sourcing partners for a variety of reasons, including the availability of specific vehicle makes and models.\nSourcing a significant portion of our consigned vehicles from a limited number of corporate vehicle sourcing partners exposes us to a number of risks, as we experienced in 2021, and may experience in the future. Our agreements with our corporate vehicle sourcing partners are generally subject to cancellation by either party upon 30 to 90 days\u2019 notice. Generally, corporate vehicle sourcing partners make non-binding commitments to us regarding consignment volumes. If a corporate vehicle sourcing partner from which we are sourcing a significant portion of our vehicles were to cease, pause or significantly reduce making vehicles available to us, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations as we would likely need to increase our sourcing of vehicles from other vehicle sourcing partners potentially on less favorable\nterms and conditions, as we did at times during 2021. Such an effort may take a number of months and may not precisely replicate the variety and quality of vehicles we have been sourcing from this single source. Further, we have been required, and may continue to be required, to increase our purchasing of vehicles at wholesale auction or by direct purchases or otherwise to maintain optimal inventory levels and mix as we work to increase vehicle supply from other vehicle sourcing partners, which could negatively affect our margins and gross profit per vehicle, as we experienced in 2021.\nWe are, and may in the future be, subject to legal proceedings in the ordinary course of our business, including claims that may not be covered by our insurers. If the outcomes of these proceedings are adverse to us, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are currently, and may, from time to time, be involved in and subject to various litigation matters, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Claims arising out of actual or alleged violations of law could be asserted against us by individuals, either individually or through class actions, by governmental entities in civil or criminal investigations and proceedings or by other entities. These claims could be asserted under a variety of laws, including but not limited to consumer finance laws, consumer protection laws, intellectual property laws, privacy laws, labor and employment laws, securities laws and employee benefit laws. These actions could expose us to adverse publicity and to substantial monetary damages and legal defense costs, injunctive relief and criminal and civil fines and penalties, including but not limited to suspension or revocation of licenses to conduct business. We cannot predict with certainty the outcome of legal proceedings or contingencies. The costs incurred in litigation can be substantial and result in the diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements \u2009-\u2009Commitments and Contingencies - Legal Matters for additional details regarding legal proceedings.\nOur potential liabilities are subject to change over time due to a variety of factors, including new developments, changes in applicable law or changes in settlement strategy, and we may become subject to or be required to pay damage awards or settlements that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. If we were required to make payments, such payments could be significant and could exceed the amounts we have accrued with respect thereto, adversely affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations. While we maintain insurance for certain risks, the amount of our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the total amount of all claims and liabilities. The incurrence of significant liabilities for which there is no or insufficient insurance coverage could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and financial condition.\nOur ability to attract and retain effective sales and reconditioning professionals may adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on our reconditioning professionals to ensure that the retail vehicles that we sell meet our quality standards. We rely on our sales professionals to develop relationships, provide exceptional customer experiences and sell vehicles and other products. The process of identifying and hiring sales and reconditioning professionals with the combination of skills and attributes required can be difficult and require significant commitment of time. In addition, competition for qualified employees and personnel in the retail vehicle industry is intense and turnover among our sales and reconditioning professionals within a few years is not uncommon. Any shortage in sales and reconditioning professionals or delay in identifying and hiring quality sales and customer service professionals could have a negative impact on our business. If we are not successful in attracting and retaining effective sales and reconditioning professionals, the quality of our vehicles and customer experience may be negatively impacted, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have a history of losses and we may not achieve profitability in the future.\nWe have experienced net losses of $39.9 million, $6.6 million, and $12.7 million in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Several factors may impact our profitability in the future:\n\u2022We expect to make investments to further develop our business, and these investments may not result in increased revenue or growth on a timely basis or at all. Our failure to realize the benefits associated with investments to further develop our business could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022We may encounter unforeseen operating expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may result in losses in future periods and may lead to further impairment losses on our assets.\n\u2022Our revenue growth may not meet our expectations in future periods\n\u2022As a public company, we will incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that Former CarLotz did not incur as a private company. As a result of these increased expenditures, we will have to generate and sustain increased revenue to achieve profitability.\nWe may not be able to sustain our revenue growth or effectively manage growth.\nOur revenue grew from $102.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $118.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $258.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. In the future, even if our revenue increases, our rate of growth may decelerate. In any event, we may not be able to grow as rapidly or at all if we do not:\n\u2022reach profitability in our hubs;\n\u2022innovate and expand our technological capabilities;\n\u2022further penetrate our existing accounts and key vehicle channels;\n\u2022add corporate vehicle sourcing partners and increase consumer sourcing; and\n\u2022successfully market our brand.\nWe have not met our objectives in the past and cannot assure you that we will be able to meet these objectives in the future. As we continue to grow, we expect to invest financial and other resources to:\n\u2022invest in our core suite of technology as well as various retail and processing enhancements;\n\u2022invest in brand marketing and advertising; and\n\u2022incur general administration, including legal, accounting and other compliance expenses related to being a public company.\nOur historical growth and projected growth will continue to place significant demands on our management and on our operational and financial resources. Our business strategy involves growth in the number of corporate vehicle sourcing partners, retail sellers and customers selling and buying cars through our platform. We have modified our previously stated goal of opening more than 40 hubs by the end of 2023 in order to focus on enhancing the efficiency of our current hubs. Our organizational structure has become more complex as we hired staff, and we will need to improve our operational, legal, financial and management controls as well as our reporting systems and procedures. We continue to develop in these areas while seeking to preserve our corporate culture of rapid innovation, teamwork and attention to the car buying and selling experience for our corporate vehicle sourcing partners, retail sellers and customers. A failure to manage our growth effectively to maintain the quality and efficiency of the car selling experience for our corporate vehicle sourcing partners, retail sellers and the quality of the vehicles we sell, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe grew rapidly in 2021, opening 14 hubs. However, our business has operated at substantial scale for only a limited period of time. Given current market conditions, including inventory constraints and our continued focus on cash utilization, and our growth in 2021, we intend to pause on any openings in new markets until market conditions change. It is difficult to predict when we will recommence opening hubs. Our historical revenue growth should not be considered indicative of our future performance. We also expect that our business will evolve in ways that may be difficult to predict. For example, over time any investments in new geographic markets and in our product offerings may be less productive than expected or be subject to unknown risks. An inability to adjust our strategy to meet changing market conditions could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur marketing activities may fail to efficiently drive growth in units sourced from consumers and corporate vehicle sourcing partners as well as units sold to buyers.\nOur future growth and success will depend in large part upon the effectiveness and efficiency of our advertising, promotion, public relations and marketing programs, and we plan to focus on efficiency in our investment in these activities. These brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenue, and the efficacy of these activities will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to do the following:\n\u2022determine the effective creative message and media mix for advertising, marketing and promotional expenditures;\n\u2022select the right markets, media and specific media vehicles in which to advertise;\n\u2022identify the most effective and efficient level of spending for each market, media and specific media vehicle; and\n\u2022effectively manage marketing costs, including creative and media expenses, to maintain acceptable retail seller and buyer acquisition costs.\nWe expect to focus on increasing the efficiency of our advertising spending in future periods to drive our growth. Increases in the pricing of one or more of our marketing and advertising channels could increase our marketing and advertising expenses or cause us to choose less expensive but possibly less effective marketing and advertising channels. If we implement new marketing and advertising strategies, we may incur significantly higher costs than our current channels, which, in turn, could adversely affect our operating results.\nImplementing new marketing and advertising strategies also could increase the risk of devoting capital and other resources to endeavors that do not prove to be cost effective. We also may incur marketing and advertising expenses significantly in advance of the time we anticipate recognizing revenue associated with such expenses and our marketing and advertising expenditures may not generate sufficient levels of brand awareness or result in increased revenue. If we are unable to maintain our marketing and advertising channels on cost-effective terms or replace or supplement existing marketing and advertising channels with similar or more effective channels, our marketing and advertising expenses could increase substantially, and thus our corporate vehicle sourcing partners, retail sellers and buyers could be adversely affected, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations have been and will continue to be adversely affected by the recent COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe global spread of COVID-19 since late 2019 has resulted in governmental authorities implementing numerous protective measures during the ongoing pandemic, such as travel restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders and shutdowns, to contain the spread of the virus and reduce its impact. These measures have impacted, continue to impact and may further impact some or all of our teammates and operations, the behavior and operations of our corporate vehicle sourcing partners, new car manufacturers, and the behavior of our customers. This pandemic has significantly disrupted economies around the world, including the United States, and will likely continue to cause significant disruptions. Although the development of vaccines has alleviated some disruption, the increase in variants, such as Delta and Omicron, has led to significant uncertainty regarding the extent and duration of potential future measures that may be taken to contain the virus and how those measures may in turn impact our business.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has also created challenges for many supply chains and uncertainty regarding economic activity and consumer demand. For example, the semi-conductor chip shortage and other COVID-related supply chain issues have created disruption and volatility in the automotive marketplace. It is also possible that changes in consumer needs, such as the increased ability to work remotely, as a result the COVID-19 pandemic could have an impact the market for vehicles generally.\nOur business and the results of our operations depends on our ability to adequately staff our hub locations. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have not been in the past, and may in the future be, unable to maintain the appropriate level of staffing given that the pandemic has perpetuated a labor shortage and also heightened labor relations issues. In addition, if our employees are quarantined or sickened as a result of exposure to COVID-19, or if they are subject to additional or future governmental COVID-19 curfews or \u201cshelter in place\u201d health orders or similar restrictions, our service and operations may be negatively affected. If we are unable to maintain the appropriate level of staffing at our hubs, our business and the results of our operations could be adversely affected.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic ultimately impacts our business, financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and unpredictable, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and the effectiveness of actions taken to contain the COVID-19 pandemic or treat its impact, among others. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic may have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in \u201cRisk Factors\u201d, including risks relating to general economic conditions.\nIncreases in labor costs, including wages, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe labor costs associated with our operations, including our retail hubs, are subject to many external factors, including unemployment levels, labor shortages, prevailing wage rates, minimum wage laws, potential collective bargaining arrangements, health insurance costs and other insurance costs and changes in employment and labor legislation or other workplace regulation. From time to time, legislative proposals are made to increase the federal minimum wage in the U.S., as well as the minimum wage in a number of states and municipalities, and to reform entitlement programs, such as health\ninsurance and paid leave programs. As minimum wages increase or related laws and regulations change, our labor costs may increase, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Increases in labor costs could force us to increase prices, which could adversely affect our sales. If competitive pressures or other factors prevent us from offsetting increased labor costs by increases in prices, our profitability may decline and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. This risk associated with labor costs is especially unpredictable given the previously discussed labor shortage.\nOur ability to maintain and expand our product offerings and introduce additional products and services may be limited, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCurrently, we offer third-party financing, insurance and vehicle protection products, which includes third-party financing of customers\u2019 vehicle purchases, as well as other value-added products, such as vehicle service contracts. If we introduce new value-added products or expand existing offerings, we may incur losses or otherwise fail to enter these markets successfully. Entry into new markets may require us to compete with new companies, cater to new corporate vehicle sourcing partner, retail seller and customer expectations and comply with new complex regulations and licensing requirements, each of which will be unfamiliar. Accordingly, we could need to invest significant resources in market research, legal counsel and our organizational infrastructure, and a return on such investments may not be achieved for several years, if at all. Additionally, failure to comply with applicable regulations or to obtain required licenses could result in penalties or fines. We may fail in demonstrating the value of any new value-added product to customers, which would compromise our ability to successfully create new revenue streams or receive returns in excess of investments. Also, we may fail to retain financing partners, which could compromise our ability to offer an often key component of a sale to customers. Any of these risks, if realized, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may experience damage or destruction to, or theft of, the vehicles consigned to us, or our processing centers or retail hubs, business interruptions or other liabilities, which may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe store the vehicles consigned to us at our 22 retail hubs until they are sold to purchasers. These vehicles may be subject to damage resulting from transportation to and from our facilities, improper or incorrect reconditioning techniques, accidents during customer test drives or improper delivery of the vehicle to purchasers. Any damage or catastrophic loss of vehicles stored at our locations, due to natural disasters, like hail, or man-made disasters, such as theft or vandalism, arsons, accidents or otherwise, would result in liability to our corporate vehicle sourcing partners, retail sellers, or us (if we own the vehicle) for the expected value of the damaged or destroyed vehicle and, depending on the scale of damage, a significant disruption to our business. In addition, we may be subject to claims by employees, corporate vehicle sourcing partners, retail sellers, customers and third parties for personal injury or property damage.\nWhile we carry insurance for all of our vehicles and the facilities in which the vehicles are stored, the insurance we carry may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms and, in any event, may not be adequate to cover all possible losses that our business could suffer. In the event that we suffer a catastrophic loss to one or more of our retail hubs or to the vehicles stored at our retail hubs, our liabilities may exceed the maximum insurance coverage amount, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe enter into alternative fee arrangements with certain of our corporate vehicle sourcing partners, which has caused, and may continue to cause, our gross profit per vehicle to fluctuate from period to period.\nWe generally charge our retail sellers and some corporate vehicle sourcing partners a flat fee for our consignment services. In addition to our flat fee model, we also enter into alternative fee arrangements, such as profit sharing programs or programs with fees based on a return above a wholesale index. The profit sharing programs generally include arrangements where we share a percentage of vehicle sale proceeds and, in some cases, fees with our corporate sourcing partners. The programs with fees based on a return above a wholesale index generally include a payment above the wholesale price. Under these sharing arrangements, our gross profit for a particular unit could be higher or lower than the gross profit per unit we would realize under our flat fee pricing model depending on, among other things, the unit\u2019s sale price and fees we are able to charge in connection with the sale. We do not have long-term contracts with our corporate vehicle sourcing partners and, under our arrangements with them, they are not required to make vehicles available to us. For these and other reasons, our mix of vehicles sourced under alternative fee arrangements has fluctuated in the past and is likely to fluctuate over time. In addition, our gross profit per unit has fluctuated in the past and is likely to fluctuate from period to period, perhaps significantly, due, among other reasons, to our mix of competitively and non-competitively sourced inventory, and the sales prices and fees we are able to collect on the vehicles.\nIn the current macroeconomic environment, where the difference between wholesale and retail used vehicle prices are compressed, the alternative fee arrangements have resulted in lower gross profit per unit than we would realize under our flat fee pricing model. and such conditions could continue to occur which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur gross profit per vehicle has been, and may continue to be, sensitive to our ability to execute on inventory sourcing plans.\nOur gross profit per unit is dependent on our ability to select (from corporate vehicle sourcing partners and retail sellers) and purchase (from retail sellers and wholesale auctions) a desirable and profitable mix of vehicles to sell. As a result of not maintaining and executing a robust inventory sourcing plan, our gross profit per vehicle has been, and may continue to be, adversely affected, as well as our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur business is sensitive to changes in the prices of new and used vehicles.\nSignificant changes in retail prices for new or used vehicles could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, if retail prices for used vehicles rise relative to retail prices for new vehicles, it could make buying a new vehicle more attractive to our customers than buying a used vehicle, reducing demand for our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, manufacturer incentives could contribute to narrowing the price gap between new and used vehicles. And lastly, lower used vehicle prices relative to wholesale could reduce the consignment of vehicles with us for sale, reducing our revenues.\nSimilar to the risk between retail prices for new and used vehicles, significant changes in the prices for wholesale used vehicles and retail used vehicles could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, during the year ended December 31, 2021 and continuing in the first quarter to date, due to the continuing semi-conductor chip shortage, COVID-related supply chain issues constraining supply of new vehicles, and an increase in wholesale prices, among other factors, partners have sometimes chose to sell vehicles quickly through the wholesale channel rather than by consignment.\nWe faced, and may continue to face, a variety of risks associated with our inspection and reconditioning operations.\nWe currently operate processing centers at all but 3 of our 22 locations across the United States. If we are unable to operate our processing centers efficiently, as we experienced in 2021, it may result in delivery delays, delays in listing our inventory, additional expenses and the loss of potential and existing corporate vehicle sourcing partners and retail sellers and subsequent revenues, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, given the supply issues in the automotive ecosystem, we are unable to be as selective in the vehicles we source which leads to the average vehicle requiring more reconditioning to meet our standards to sell than in prior periods, resulting in increased processing time, reliance on third party providers, and increased costs. We have also experienced, and may continue to experience, inflationary pressure in our inspection and reconditioning operations, including in connection with used vehicle replacement parts.\nDuring 2021, as we expanded our geographic footprint by increasing the number of our hubs, we increased our reconditioning capacity in anticipation of increased demand, which did not occur at the levels we expected. We are currently focused on consolidating our reconditioning capacity to reduce our costs. There is no assurance that any such consolidation or proposed efficiency actions will achieve such objective or provide us with an optimum platform for reconditioning operations in the future. In addition, if we are unable to operate our processing centers efficiently, we may increase our reliance on third party service providers for reconditioning, which could damage our reputation and decrease the quality of our services.\nFurther, in certain locations, we currently outsource all reconditioning services to third party providers which prevents us from controlling the cost or availability of such services. If we are unable to maintain our relationship with our third-party service providers, such service providers could cease to provide the services we need or such service providers are unable to effectively deliver services to our standards on timelines and at the prices we have negotiated, and we are unable to contract with alternative vendors or replace such service providers with our in house reconditioning specialists, we could experience delivery delays, a decrease in the quality of our reconditioning services, delays in listing vehicles consigned to us for sale and increased time to sale, additional expenses and loss of potential and existing corporate vehicle sourcing partners and retail sellers and subsequent revenues, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on third-party carriers to transport vehicles to our hubs and customers and we are subject to associated business risks and costs of the transportation industry generally, many of which are out of our control.\nWe rely on third-party carriers to transport vehicles to our facilities as well as from our retail hubs to purchasers that elect to have their used vehicle delivered to them. As a result, we are exposed to risks associated with the transportation industry such as weather, traffic patterns, local and federal regulations, vehicular crashes, gasoline prices and lack of reliability of many independent carriers. Third-party carriers who deliver vehicles to our customers could adversely affect the customer experience if they do not perform to our standards of professionalism and courtesy, potentially negatively impacting our brand perception, and eventually, business results.\nCertain state laws prohibit or restrict vehicle consignment and, if additional states enact similar laws, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur consignment operations are prohibited under the laws of certain states, such as South Carolina, Ohio and Kentucky. If other states enact similar laws, we could be prevented from opening retail hubs in those states or, if we are already present in those states, we could be forced to cease operations in those states. In addition, we may face risks that state and national auto dealer associations lobby other state governments to enact similar vehicle consignment laws. If a significant number of states, in particular states where we have significant operations and consignment activity, were to enact similar laws, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry that is subject to a range of federal, state and local laws and regulations and if we fail to comply, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, some of these laws establish either a private right of action or permit private individuals and entities to enforce the same in the name of the relevant government entity.\nOur business is and will continue to be subject to a wide range of federal, state and local laws and regulations, some of which are novel and without relevant precedent. Such laws and regulations include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022state and local licensing requirements;\n\u2022state and local titling and registration requirements;\n\u2022state laws regulating the sale of motor vehicles and related products and services;\n\u2022federal and state laws regulating vehicle financing;\n\u2022federal and state consumer protection laws; and\n\u2022federal and state data privacy laws.\nThe federal agencies that regulate our business and have the authority to enforce such regulations and laws against us include the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the \u201cFTC\u201d), the U.S. Department of Transportation, the U.S. Occupational Health and Safety Administration, the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Federal Communications Commission. For example, the FTC has jurisdiction to investigate and enforce our compliance with certain consumer protection laws and has brought enforcement actions against auto dealers relating to a broad range of practices, including the sale and financing of value-added or add-on products. We are also subject to a variety of federal laws that may require us to incur costs in order to be in compliance with such laws, including the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, or the ADA. Additionally, we are subject to regulation and audit by individual state dealer licensing authorities, state consumer protection agencies and state financial regulatory agencies and are subject to a variety of state laws. We are also subject to audit by such state regulatory authorities.\nOur marketing and disclosure regarding the sale and servicing of vehicles is regulated by federal, state and local agencies, including the FTC and state attorneys general. Some of these authorities either establish a private right of action or permit a private individual or entity to enforce on behalf of a state entity (\u201cprivate attorney general\u201d). We have in the past been subject to claims under these laws, and we may experience additional claims in the future.\nState dealer licensing authorities regulate the purchase and sale of used vehicles by dealers within their respective states. The applicability of these regulatory and legal compliance obligations to our e-commerce business is dependent on evolving interpretations of these laws and regulations and how our operations are, or are not, subject to them, and we may face regulatory action if regulators believe that we are not in compliance with such obligations. We are licensed as a dealer in each of the states in which operate one or more retail hubs and all of our vehicle transactions are conducted under such licenses. We believe that our activities in other states are not currently subject to their vehicle dealer licensing laws, however regulators could seek to\nenforce those laws against us. In addition, if we determine or are instructed by state regulators that obtaining a license in another state is necessary, either due to expansion or otherwise, we may not be able to obtain such a license within the timeframe we expect or at all.\nSome states regulate retail installment sales, including setting a maximum interest rate, caps on certain fees, including processing fees, or maximum amounts financed. Processing fees represent a significant portion of our gross profit and further restrictions or limitations on these fees may have a negative impact on our results of operations. In addition, certain states require that retail installment sellers file a notice of intent or have a sales finance license or an installment sellers license in order to solicit or originate installment sales in that state. All vehicle sale transactions and applicable retail installment financings are conducted under our state dealer licenses. As we seek to expand our operations, we may be required to obtain additional finance or other licenses, and we may not be able to obtain such licenses within the timeframe we expect or at all.\nAny failure to renew or maintain any of the foregoing licenses would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Many aspects of our business are subject to regulatory regimes at the state and local level, and we may not have all licenses required to conduct business in every jurisdiction in which we operate. Despite our belief that we are not subject to certain licensing requirements of those state and local jurisdictions, regulators may seek to impose fines or other sanctions for operating without a license or demand we seek a license in those state and local jurisdictions, any of which may inhibit our ability to do business in those state and local jurisdictions, increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition to these laws and regulations that apply specifically to the purchase, consignment and sale of used vehicles, our facilities and business operations are subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, occupational health and safety and other broadly applicable business regulations. Increased environmental regulation may in the future limit the sale of the used vehicles that we sell or make it more expensive and less desirable for customers. We also are subject to laws and regulations involving taxes, tariffs, privacy and data security, anti-spam, pricing, content protection, credit and financing, electronic contracts and communications, mobile communications, consumer protection, information reporting requirements, unencumbered internet access to our platform, the design and operation of websites and internet neutrality.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations affecting public companies, including securities laws and the Nasdaq listing rules. The violation of any of these laws or regulations could result in administrative, civil or criminal penalties or in a cease-and-desist order against our business operations, any of which could damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenses and other costs to comply with these laws and regulations.\nThe foregoing description of laws and regulations to which we are or may be subject is not exhaustive, and the regulatory framework governing our operations is subject to evolving interpretations and continuous change.\nIf we do not adequately provide advancements in our external facing technology utilized by our corporate vehicle sourcing partners, retail sellers and customers to conduct business, including mobile device technology, our operating results could be harmed and our growth could be negatively affected.\nThe shift to mobile technology by our corporate vehicle sourcing partners, retail sellers and customers may harm our business in the following ways:\n\u2022corporate vehicle sourcing partners, retail sellers and customers visiting our website from a mobile device may not accept mobile technology as a viable long-term platform to buy or sell a vehicle. This may occur for a number of reasons, including our ability to provide the same level of website functionality to a mobile device that we provide on a desktop computer, the actual or perceived lack of security of information on a mobile device and possible disruptions of service or connectivity;\n\u2022we may not continue to innovate and introduce enhanced products that can be suitably conveyed on mobile platforms;\n\u2022consumers using mobile devices may believe that our competitors offer superior products and features based in part on our inability to provide sufficient website functionality to convince a mobile device user to transact with us; or\n\u2022regulations related to consumer finance disclosures, including the Truth in Lending Act, may be interpreted, in the context of mobile devices, in a manner that could expose us to legal liability in the event we are found to have violated applicable laws.\nIf we do not develop suitable functionality for users who visit our website using a mobile device, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.\nWe may require the expansion of our existing floorplan credit facility and/or additional debt and equity capital to pursue our business objectives and respond to business opportunities, challenges or unforeseen circumstances and if such capital is not available, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe may require the expansion of our existing floorplan credit facility and/or additional equity or debt capital to pursue our business objectives and respond to business opportunities, challenges or unforeseen circumstances, including to fund our marketing expenditures to improve our brand awareness, enhance our technology, develop new products or services or further improve existing products and services, enhance our operating infrastructure and acquire complementary businesses and technologies. However, additional funds may not be available when we need them on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, any additional debt financing that we secure in the future could involve restrictive covenants, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities. Continuing operating losses could lead to a violation of covenants related to our existing floorplan credit facility and could lead them to call the debt. Volatility in the credit markets may also have an adverse effect on our ability to obtain debt financing. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our stockholders could experience significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to pursue our business objectives and to respond to business opportunities, challenges or unforeseen circumstances could be significantly limited, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe face a variety of risks associated with identifying, leasing and dedicating capital expenditure for our current and any future locations.\nWe are required to obtain approvals, permits and licenses from state regulators and local municipalities to construct or renovate and operate our retail hubs. We may face delays in obtaining the requisite approvals, permits and licenses to renovate and operate our retail hubs or we may not be able to obtain them at all. If we encounter delays in obtaining or cannot obtain the requisite approvals, permits and licenses to renovate and operate our retail hubs in desirable locations, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nA significant disruption in service on our website could damage our reputation and result in a loss of corporate vehicle sourcing partners, retail sellers and customers, which could harm our business, brand, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur brand, reputation and ability to attract corporate vehicle sourcing partners, retail sellers and customers depend in large part on the reliable performance of our website and the supporting systems, technology and infrastructure. We may experience significant interruptions with our systems in the future. Interruptions in these systems, whether due to system failures, programming or configuration errors, computer viruses, or physical or electronic break-ins, could affect the availability of our inventory on our website and prevent or inhibit the ability of our corporate vehicle sourcing partners, retail sellers and customers to access our website. Problems with the reliability or security of our systems could harm our reputation, result in a loss of corporate vehicle sourcing partners, retail sellers and customers and result in additional costs.\nThe communications, network and hardware to operate our website are provided to us by a third-party service provider and exist in fully redundant environments. In addition, we do not own or control the operation of these facilities. Our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, terrorist attacks, acts of war, hacking, electronic and physical break-ins, computer viruses, earthquakes and similar events. The occurrence of any of these events could damage our systems and hardware or could cause them to fail.\nAny errors, defects, disruptions, or other performance or reliability problems with our network operations could interrupt our customers\u2019 access to inventory and cause delays and result in additional expense in arranging access to new facilities and services, any of which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on third party technology to complete critical business functions, and if that technology fails to adequately serve our needs and we cannot find alternatives, it may negatively impact our operating results.\nWe rely on third party technology for certain of our critical business functions, including customer identity verification for financing, inventory data, software libraries and development environments and tools, and services to allow corporate vehicle\nsourcing partners, retail sellers and customers to digitally sign contracts. If these technologies fail or we cannot maintain our relationships with the technology providers and we cannot find suitable alternatives, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe depend on key personnel to operate our business, and if we are unable to retain, attract and integrate qualified personnel, our ability to develop and successfully grow our business could be adversely affected.\nWe believe our success depends on the efforts and talents of our executives and employees. Our future success depends on our continuing ability to attract, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified and skilled employees. Qualified individuals are in high demand, and we may incur significant costs to attract and retain them. In addition, the loss of any of our key employees or senior management, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to execute our business plan and strategy, and we may not be able to find adequate replacements on a timely basis, or at all. The Board has announced the appointment of Lev Peker as our Chief Executive Officer and a member of the Board, effective as of April 18, 2022, to succeed our Chief Executive Officer, Michael Bor, who was also our Chairman of the Board, succeeded by Luis Ignacio Solorzano Aizpuru. Our future performance will depend, in part, on the successful transition of the Chief Executive Officer position. If we do not successfully manage the transition, it could be viewed negatively by our customers, employees, investors, suppliers and other third-party partners, and could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations. Most of our staff are at-will employees, which means they may terminate their employment relationship with us at any time, and their knowledge of our business and industry would be difficult to replace. We do not, and do not currently expect to have in the future, \u201ckey person\u201d insurance on the lives of any member of our senior management. If we do not succeed in attracting well-qualified employees or retaining and motivating existing employees, our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may acquire other companies or technologies, which could divert our management\u2019s attention, result in additional dilution to stockholders and otherwise disrupt our operations and adversely affect our operating results.\nOur continued success will depend, in part, on our ability to grow our business in response to the demands of consumers and other constituents within the automotive industry as well as competitive pressures. In some circumstances, we may determine to do so through the acquisition of complementary businesses and technologies rather than through internal development. The identification of suitable acquisition candidates can be difficult, time-consuming and costly, and we may not be able to successfully complete identified acquisitions. The risks we face in connection with acquisitions include:\n\u2022diversion of management time and focus from operating our business to addressing acquisition integration challenges;\n\u2022coordination of technology, research and development and sales and marketing functions;\n\u2022transition of the acquired company\u2019s users to our website and mobile applications;\n\u2022retention of employees from the acquired company;\n\u2022cultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into our organization;\n\u2022integration of the acquired company\u2019s accounting, management information, human resources and other administrative systems;\n\u2022the need to implement or improve controls, policies and procedures at a business that prior to the acquisition may have lacked effective controls, policies and procedures;\n\u2022potential write-offs of intangibles or other assets acquired in such transactions that may have an adverse effect our operating results;\n\u2022liability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including patent and trademark infringement claims, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities and other known and unknown liabilities; and\n\u2022litigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims from terminated employees, consumers, former stockholders or other third parties.\nOur failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with acquisitions and investments could result in our failure to realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions or investments, cause us to incur unanticipated liabilities and otherwise harm our business. Future acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, amortization expenses or the write-off of goodwill, any of which could harm our financial condition. Also, the anticipated benefits of any acquisitions may not materialize.\nIf we fail to implement and maintain an effective system of internal control to remediate our material weaknesses over financial reporting, we may be unable to accurately report our results of operations, meet our reporting obligations as a public company, or prevent fraud, and investor confidence and the trading prices of our securities may be materially and adversely affected.\nPrior to the Merger, Former CarLotz was a private company with limited internal accounting and financial reporting personnel and other resources with which it addressed its internal control over financial reporting. In connection with the audits of Former CarLotz\u2019 consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 and for the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2019, Former CarLotz and its independent registered public accounting firm identified material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting. Although some aspects of the material weaknesses identified have been remediated, the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting continues to exist. As defined in the standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, a \u201cmaterial weakness\u201d is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nThe material weaknesses identified that continue to exist relate to our inability to maintain an effective control environment and our inability to design and implement effective control activities to enable the identification and mitigation of risks of material misstatement. We are in the process of implementing a number of measures to address these material weaknesses. See \u201cControls and Procedures\u2009-\u2009Remediation Efforts to Address Material Weaknesses\u201d. However, we cannot assure you that these measures will fully address the material weaknesses and deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting or that we may conclude that they have been fully remediated.\nWe are subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and specifically to Section 404 thereof, which requires that we include a certification from management on the effectiveness of our internal controls in our annual report on Form 10-K. In addition, once we cease to be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as such term is defined in the JOBS Act, our independent registered public accounting firm must attest to and report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Moreover, even if our management concludes that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, our independent registered public accounting firm, after conducting its own independent testing, may issue a report that is qualified if it is not satisfied with our internal controls or the level at which our controls are documented, designed, operated or reviewed, or if it interprets the relevant requirements differently from us. In addition, our reporting obligations may place a significant strain on our management, operational and financial resources and systems. We may be unable to complete our evaluation testing and any required remediation on a timely basis or at all.\nDuring the course of documenting and testing our internal control procedures, in order to satisfy the requirements of Section 404, we may identify other weaknesses and deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting, as these standards are modified, supplemented or audited from time to time, we may not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404. Generally speaking, if we fail to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment, it could result in material misstatements in our financial statements and could also impair our ability to comply with applicable financial reporting requirements and related regulatory filings on a timely basis. As a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. Additionally, ineffective internal control over financial reporting could expose us to increased risk of fraud or misuse of corporate assets and subject us to potential delisting from Nasdaq, regulatory investigations and civil or criminal sanctions. We may also be required to restate our financial statements from prior periods.\nInsurance policies may not cover all of our operating risks and a casualty loss beyond the limits of our coverage could negatively impact our business.\nWe are subject to all of the operating hazards and risks normally incidental to the provision of auto sales. In addition to contractual provisions limiting our liability to our corporate vehicle sourcing partners, retail sellers, customers and third parties, we maintain insurance policies in such amounts and with such coverage and deductibles as required by law and that we believe are reasonable and prudent. Nevertheless, such insurance may not be adequate to protect us from all the liabilities and expenses that may occur from claims arising in the ordinary course of our business and current levels of insurance may not be able to be maintained or be available at economical prices. If a significant liability claim is brought against us that is not covered by insurance, then we may have to pay the claim with our own funds, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCertain of our third-party service providers are highly regulated financial institutions, and the federal and state laws related to financial services could have a direct or indirect material adverse effect on our business.\nWe have entered into agreements with various third-party financial institutions related to the financing by those institutions of our customers\u2019 vehicle purchases as well as the provision of various value-added products. Our counterparties that are financial institutions are subject to extensive federal and state laws and regulations related to the provision of financial services, and their ability to provide financing and other products and services could be materially limited or eliminated as a result of financial regulatory or supervisory issues as well as changes in federal or state laws, regulations or guidance related to the provision of financial services. In the event of such disruptions, our business could be materially and adversely affected if we are unable, in a commercially reasonable manner, to identify and enter into alternative arrangements with other institutions on substantially similar terms as those that exist with our current providers.\nMoreover, we are subject to contractual obligations requiring that we comply with, or help to facilitate compliance by our financial institution counterparties with, a broad range of regulatory requirements and obligations, including without limitation those related to sourcing partner and customer data, data security, privacy, anti-money laundering and the detection and prevention of financial crimes. The federal and state regulators responsible for implementing and enforcing these laws and regulations routinely examine our financial institution counterparties with respect to their compliance with such laws and regulations, including the extent to which these institutions\u2019 third-party relationships may present compliance risks. Despite our best efforts to comply with all applicable regulatory and contractual obligations, it is possible that there could be some perceived or actual deficiency in our ability to adequately comply with financial regulatory requirements or to serve as a contractual counterparty to a regulated financial institution. Any such perceived or actual deficiency or risk to a regulated financial institution could result in a disruption of our relationship with that institution as well as with other lenders and other financial services counterparties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSeasonal and other fluctuations in our quarterly operating results are likely and may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business.\nWe expect our quarterly results of operations, including our revenue, cash flow and net profit or loss, to vary significantly in the future based in part on, among other things, seasonal and cyclical patterns in vehicle sales in the United States. Used vehicle sales generally experience seasonality with sales typically peaking late in the first calendar quarter of each year and diminishing through the rest of the year, with the lowest relative level of vehicle sales expected to occur in the fourth calendar quarter. Used vehicle prices also historically have exhibited seasonality, with used vehicle prices declining at a faster rate in the last two quarters of each year and a slower rate in the first two quarters of each year, all other factors being equal.\nAdditionally, a significant portion of our expenses are fixed and do not vary proportionately with fluctuations in revenues. Accordingly, our results in any quarter may not indicate the results we may achieve in any subsequent quarter or for the full year, and sequential period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful.\nWe rely on Internet search engines and automobile listing sites to help drive traffic to our website, and if we fail to appear prominently in the search results or fail to drive traffic through paid advertising, our traffic would decline and our business would be adversely affected.\nWe depend in part on Internet search engines, such as Google, to drive traffic to our website. Our ability to maintain and increase the number of visitors directed to our website is not entirely within our control. Our competitors may increase their search engine optimization efforts and outbid us for search terms on various search engines, resulting in their websites receiving a higher search result page ranking than ours. Additionally, Internet search engines could revise their methodologies in a way that would adversely affect our search result rankings. If Internet search engines modify their search algorithms in ways that are detrimental to us, or if our competitors\u2019 efforts are more successful than ours, overall growth in our corporate vehicle sourcing partner, retail seller and customer base could slow or our corporate vehicle sourcing partner, retail seller and customer base could decline. Internet search engine providers could provide automotive dealer and pricing information directly in search results, align with our competitors or choose to develop competing services. Our website has experienced fluctuations in search result rankings in the past, and we anticipate similar fluctuations in the future. Any reduction in the number of users directed to our website through Internet search engines could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is sensitive to conditions affecting automobile manufacturers generally, including vehicle recalls.\nAdverse conditions affecting one or more automotive manufacturers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could impact the supply of vehicles. In addition, manufacturer recalls are a common occurrence that have accelerated in frequency and scope in recent years. Recalls and the increased regulatory scrutiny surrounding selling used vehicles with open safety recalls could adversely affect used vehicle sales or valuations, could cause us to temporarily remove vehicles from inventory, could force us to incur increased costs and could expose us to litigation and adverse publicity related to the sale of recalled vehicles, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate a wholly-owned captive reinsurance subsidiary and participate in a reinsurance program for extended warranties. Our reinsurance program for extended warranties may not be successful or may incur larger losses than anticipated, which could harm our business and reputation.\nWe operate a wholly-owned captive reinsurance subsidiary in connection with certain extended warranty contracts that we offer to our customers for sale by a third party servicer. Our captive reinsurance subsidiary then contracts with the third party servicer to reinsure the claims made under the extended warranties in exchange for which the third party servicer pays the premiums collected on the policies to the reinsurance subsidiary. The purpose of our reinsurance subsidiary is to absorb negative loss developments. Specifically, with product warranty programs, future developments regarding the products comprising the program and their attendant loss development remains uncertain. If future losses materially deviate from our current estimates, they may exceed the amounts collected for the payment of claims, which could render the reinsurance subsidiary unable to pay claims, which could result in our no longer being able to offer these products, subject us to third party claims and harm our reputation and ability to sell our other finance and insurance products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary becomes subject to a bankruptcy or similar proceeding, we may be liable for its outstanding obligations.\nWe have structured our wholly-owned captive reinsurance subsidiary to be bankruptcy remote with the intention that assets of CarLotz would not be available to satisfy creditors. We can provide no guarantees that, in the actual event of a bankruptcy or similar proceeding, the structure of our reinsurance subsidiary will operate as intended. In addition, existing or future laws and regulations may be interpreted differently and may limit the extent of bankruptcy protections provided to us by our subsidiary.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property and Data Privacy\nIf we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property, technology and confidential information, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business depends on our intellectual property, technology and confidential information, the protection of which is crucial to the success of our business. We attempt to protect our intellectual property, technology and confidential information by requiring certain of our employees and consultants to enter into confidentiality and assignment of inventions agreements and certain third parties to enter into nondisclosure agreements. These agreements may not effectively grant all necessary rights to any inventions that may have been developed by the employees and consultants. In addition, these agreements may not effectively prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information, intellectual property or technology and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information, intellectual property or technology. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our website features, software and functionality or obtain and use information that we consider proprietary. Changes in the law or adverse court rulings may also negatively affect our ability to prevent others from using our technology.\nWe currently hold rights to the \u201cCarLotz.com\u201d Internet domain name and various other related domain names. The regulation of domain names in the U.S. is subject to change. Regulatory bodies could establish additional top-level domains, appoint additional domain name registrars or modify the requirements for holding domain names. As a result, we may not be able to acquire or maintain all domain names that use the name CarLotz or are otherwise important for our business.\nWe collect, process, store, share, disclose and use personal information and other data relating to our customers and corporate vehicle sourcing partners and retail sellers, and our actual or perceived failure to protect such information and data could damage our reputation and brand and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe collect, process, store, share, disclose and use personal information and other data provided by our sourcing partners and customers. We rely on encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties to effect secure transmission of such information. We may need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches or to address problems caused by breaches. Any failure or perceived failure to maintain the security of personal and other data that is provided to us by our sourcing partners, customers and vendors could harm our reputation and brand and expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, concerns about our practices with regard to the collection, use or disclosure of personal information or other privacy related matters, even if unfounded, could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThere are numerous federal, state and local laws regarding privacy and the collection, processing, storing, sharing, disclosing, use and protection of personal information and other data, the scope of which are changing, subject to differing interpretations and that may be costly to comply with and may be inconsistent between jurisdictions or conflict with other rules. Federal and various state governmental bodies and agencies have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations limiting, or laws and regulations regarding, the collection, distribution, use, disclosure, storage and security of certain categories of information. Some of these requirements include obligations of companies to notify individuals of security breaches involving particular personal information, which could result from exploitation of a vulnerability in our systems or services or by our service providers or partners. For example, the State of California enacted the California Consumer Privacy ACT (the \u201cCCPA\u201d) and it expands the scope of what is considered \u201cpersonal information\u201d and creates new data access and opt-out rights for consumers, which may create new requirements for us and other companies that operate in California. Additionally, the California Privacy Rights Act (\u201cCPRA\u201d) recently passed in California. The CPRA significantly amends the CCPA and imposes additional data protection obligations on covered companies doing business in California, including additional consumer rights processes and opt outs for certain uses of sensitive data. It also created a new California data protection agency specifically tasked to enforce the law, which would likely result in increased regulatory scrutiny of California businesses in the areas of data protection and security. The substantive requirements for businesses subject to the CPRA will go into effect on January 1, 2023, and become enforceable on July 1, 2023. We are also subject to state and federal laws and regulations regarding telemarketing and other telephonic communications and state and federal laws regarding unsolicited commercial emails, as well as regulations relating to automated telemarketing calls, texts or SMS messages. In addition, we are subject to the terms of our privacy policies and privacy-related obligations to third parties and may agree to additional contractual requirements addressing these matters from time to time.\nWe may not be successful in complying with the rapidly evolving privacy, data protection, and data security requirements. It is possible that these obligations may be interpreted and applied in new ways or in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or our practices or that new regulations could be enacted. Our compliance with these various requirements increases our operating costs, and additional laws, regulations, standards or protocols (or new interpretations of existing laws, regulations, standards or protocols) in these areas may further increase our operating costs and adversely affect our ability to effectively market our products and services. In view of new or modified legal obligations relating to privacy, data protection or information security, or any changes in their interpretation, we may find it necessary or desirable to change certain business activities and practices or to expend significant resources to modify our products and services and otherwise adapt to these changes. We may be unable to make such changes and modifications in a commercially reasonable manner or at all.\nAny failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our privacy policies, our privacy-related obligations to our sourcing partners or customers or other third parties, or our privacy-related legal obligations, or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of sensitive information, which may include personally identifiable information or other sourcing partner or customer data, may result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation or public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or others and could cause our sourcing partners, customers and vendors to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our business. Additionally, if vendors, developers or other third parties that we work with violate applicable laws or our policies, such violations may also put our sourcing partner, customer or vendors\u2019 information at risk and could in turn harm our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may in the future be subject to intellectual property disputes, which are costly to defend and could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may from time to time face allegations that we have infringed the trademarks, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties, including from our competitors. We may be unaware of the intellectual property rights that others may claim over some or all of our technology or services. Patent and other intellectual property litigation may be protracted and expensive, and the results are difficult to predict and may require us to stop offering some features, purchase\nlicenses or modify our products and features while we develop non-infringing substitutes, or may result in significant settlement costs.\nEven if these matters do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor or without significant cash settlements, these matters, and the time and resources necessary to litigate or resolve them, could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock and Provisions of Our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws\nOur stock price may fluctuate significantly and you could lose all or part of your investment as a result.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to be volatile. The stock market recently has experienced extreme volatility. This volatility often has been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies. You may not be able to resell your shares of common stock at an attractive price due to a number of factors such as those listed in \u201c- Risks Related to Our Business\u201d and the following:\n\u2022results of operations that vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors;\n\u2022results of operations that vary from those of our competitors;\n\u2022changes in expectations as to our future financial performance, including projections, financial estimates and investment recommendations by securities analysts and investors;\n\u2022declines in the market prices of stocks generally;\n\u2022strategic actions by us or our competitors;\n\u2022announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, joint ventures, other strategic relationships or capital commitments;\n\u2022any significant change in our management;\n\u2022changes in general economic or market conditions or trends in our industry or markets;\n\u2022changes in business or regulatory conditions, including new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;\n\u2022future sales of common stock or other securities;\n\u2022investor perceptions of the investment opportunity associated with our common stock relative to other investment alternatives;\n\u2022the public\u2019s response to press releases or other public announcements by us or third parties, including our filings with the SEC;\n\u2022litigation involving us, our industry, or both, or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of our competitors;\n\u2022guidance, if any, that we provide to the public, any changes in this guidance or our failure to meet this guidance;\n\u2022the development and sustainability of an active trading market for the common stock;\n\u2022actions by institutional or activist stockholders;\n\u2022changes in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations or principles;\n\u2022other events or factors, including those resulting from concerted efforts by retail investors, pandemics, natural disasters, acts of terrorism or responses to these events; and\n\u2022political unrest, war, geopolitical uncertainties, trade policies and sanctions, such as the current situation involving Ukraine and Russia and the resulting sanctions, which could delay and disrupt our business, and if such political unrest escalates or leads to disruptions in the financial markets or puts further pressure on global supply chains, it could heighten many of the other risk factors included in this Item 1A.\nThese broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of the common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. In addition, price volatility may be greater if the public float and trading volume of the common stock is low.\nVolatility in the price of our stock could be the subject of investor claims. If we are involved in securities litigation, it could have a substantial cost and divert resources and the attention of executive management from our business regardless of the\noutcome of such litigation. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements\u2009-\u2009Commitments and Contingencies - Legal Matters for additional details regarding legal proceedings.\nBecause there are no current plans to pay cash dividends on the common stock for the foreseeable future, you may not receive any return on investment unless you sell your common stock at a price greater than what you paid for it.\nWe intend to retain future earnings, if any, for future operations, expansion and debt repayment and there are no current plans to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. The declaration, amount and payment of any future dividends on shares of common stock will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors. Our board of directors may take into account general and economic conditions, our financial condition and results of operations, our available cash and current and anticipated cash needs, capital requirements, contractual, legal, tax and regulatory restrictions, implications of the payment of dividends by us to our stockholders or by our subsidiaries to us and such other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant. As a result, you may not receive any return on an investment in the common stock unless you sell your common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it.\nStockholders may experience dilution in the future.\nThe percentage of shares of common stock owned by current stockholders may be diluted in the future because of equity issuances for acquisitions, capital market transactions or otherwise, including, without limitation, equity awards that we may grant to our directors, officers and employees, exercise of the warrants or meeting the conditions under the Earnout Shares. Such issuances may have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share, which could adversely affect the market price of the common stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, if they change their recommendations regarding the common stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, the common stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for the common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our businesses. If no securities or industry analysts commence coverage of us, the trading price for the common stock could be negatively impacted. In the event securities or industry analysts initiate coverage, if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our securities or publish unfavorable research about our businesses, or if our operating results do not meet analyst expectations, the trading price of the common stock would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for the common stock could decrease, which might cause the common stock price and trading volume to decline.\nFuture sales, or the perception of future sales, by us or our stockholders in the public market could cause the market price for the common stock to decline.\nThe sale of shares of common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could harm the prevailing market price of shares of common stock. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate.\nIn connection with the Merger, Acamar Partners Sponsor I LLC (the \u2018Sponsor\u201d) has agreed, subject to certain exceptions, not to dispose of or hedge any of its Founder Shares (or shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of its Founder Shares):\ni.with respect to 25% of the shares, the date on which the closing price of the common stock has exceeded $12.50 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) over any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing 150 days after January 21, 2021 (the \u201cClosing Date\u201d); and\nii.with respect to 25% of the shares, the date on which the closing trading price of the common stock has exceeded $15.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) over any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing 150 days after the Closing Date;\niii.provided that, if any condition set forth in clause (i) or (ii) above is not met before the first business day following 60 months from the Closing Date, the applicable portion of the shares will be forfeited.\nPursuant to a Registration Rights and Lock-up Agreement, certain stockholders will have the right, subject to certain conditions, to require us to register the sale of their shares of common stock under the Securities Act. By exercising their registration rights and selling a large number of shares, these stockholders could cause the prevailing market price of the common stock to decline.\nAs restrictions on resale end or if these stockholders exercise their registration rights, the trading price of shares of the common stock could drop significantly if the holders of these shares sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to raise additional funds through future offerings of shares of common stock or other securities.\nIn addition, the shares of common stock reserved for future issuance under our equity incentive plans will become eligible for sale in the public market once those shares are issued, subject to any applicable vesting requirements, lockup agreements and other restrictions imposed by law. As of January 1, 2022, approximately 11,811,785 shares of common stock that are either subject to outstanding options or other equity awards or reserved for future issuance under our equity incentive plans have been registered on Form S-8 registration statements and may be freely sold in the public market upon issuance, except for shares held by affiliates who have certain restrictions on their ability to sell. If these additional shares of common stock are sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold, in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nIn the future, we may also issue securities in connection with investments or acquisitions. The amount of shares of common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of the then-outstanding shares of common stock. Any issuance of additional securities in connection with investments or acquisitions may result in additional dilution to stockholders.\nWe are an emerging growth company within the meaning of the Securities Act, and if we take advantage of certain exemptions from disclosure requirements available to emerging growth companies, this could make our securities less attractive to investors and may make it more difficult to compare our performance with other public companies.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d within the meaning of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. We may continue to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. As a result, stockholders may not have access to certain information they may deem important. We cannot predict whether investors will find securities issued by us less attractive because we rely on these exemptions. If some investors find those securities less attractive as a result of our reliance on these exemptions, the trading prices of our securities may be lower than they otherwise would be, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the trading prices of our securities may be more volatile.\nFurther, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies, but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with another public company that is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company that has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our certificate of incorporation charter and bylaws and Delaware law could make an acquisition of us more difficult, limit attempts by stockholders to replace or remove our management and limit the market price of the common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the Delaware General Corporation Law (\u201cDGCL\u201d) contain provisions that could have the effect of rendering more difficult, delaying or preventing an acquisition deemed undesirable by our board of directors. These provisions include, among others, the following:\n\u2022authorization of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, which could be issued by our board of directors without stockholder approval and may contain voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to the common stock;\n\u2022limited liability for, and providing indemnification to, our directors and officers;\n\u2022our board of directors is classified into three classes of directors with staggered three-year terms, which may delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of our board of directors;\n\u2022our directors may be removed only for cause by the affirmative vote of 662\u22153% of the then-outstanding voting power of our voting stock;\n\u2022our board of directors is expressly authorized to adopt, alter, amend or repeal our bylaws without a stockholder vote in any manner not inconsistent with the laws of the State of Delaware, and any adoption, alteration, amendment or repeal of our bylaws by stockholders will require the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 662\u22153% of the voting power of the then-outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote;\n\u2022no cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u2022vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by the majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum, and not by stockholders;\n\u2022a prohibition on the ability of stockholders to call special meetings;\n\u2022advance notice procedures will apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring matters before an annual meeting;\n\u2022any action to be taken by stockholders is required to be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting and not by written consent;\n\u2022special meetings of stockholders can be called only by a majority of our board of directors, the chair of our board of directors or our Chief Executive Officer; and\n\u2022certain litigation against us can only be brought in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware.\nWe are also subject to the anti-takeover provisions contained in Section 203 of the DGCL, pursuant to which a corporation may not, in general, engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or longer or, among other exceptions, the board of directors has approved the transaction.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors, officers, other employees or stockholders.\nOur certificate of incorporation requires (among other things) that, unless we consent to the selection of an alternative forum, the sole and exclusive forum for (1) any derivative actions brought on behalf of the Company, (2) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, other employees or stockholders, (3) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws or (4) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be exclusively brought in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware (or, if such court does not have jurisdiction, another state court in Delaware or the federal district court for the District of Delaware) and, if brought outside of Delaware, the stockholder bringing the suit will be deemed to have consented to service of process on such stockholder\u2019s counsel, except for any action (A) as to which the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware determines that there is an indispensable party not subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery (and the indispensable party does not consent to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery within ten days following such determination), (B) that is vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or forum other than the Court of Chancery, (C) for which the Court of Chancery does not have subject matter jurisdiction or (D) any action arising under the federal securities laws, as to which the Court of Chancery and the federal district court for the District of Delaware shall have concurrent jurisdiction.\nSection 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all such Securities Act claims. Accordingly, both state and federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain such claims. To prevent having to litigate claims in multiple jurisdictions and the threat of inconsistent or contrary rulings by different courts, among other considerations, our certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States shall be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. There is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce such a forum selection provision as written in connection with claims arising under the Securities Act.\nAny person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the forum provisions in our certificate of incorporation.\nThis choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that stockholder finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers, other employees or stockholders, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims, although our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that certain transactions are not \u201ccorporate opportunities\u201d and that the parties to the Stockholders Agreement, or any of their principals, members, directors, partners, stockholders, officers, employees, or other representatives or affiliates (other than the Company and any entity that is controlled by the Company) are not subject to the doctrine of corporate opportunity.\nTwo of our directors, Mr. Steven G. Carrel and Mr. David R. Mitchell, are affiliates of TRP Capital Partners, LP (\u201cTRP\u201d) and one of our directors and Chairman of the Board, Mr. Luis Ignacio Solorzano Aizpuru, is an affiliate of the Sponsor. Our certificate of incorporation provides that, to the extent allowed by law, the doctrine of \u201ccorporate opportunity\u201d will not apply to each of the stockholders party to the Stockholders Agreement, or any of their principals, members, directors, partners, stockholders, officers, employees, or other representatives or affiliates (other than the Company and any entity that is controlled by the Company) (\u201cIdentified Persons\u201d). The doctrine of corporate opportunity generally provides that a corporate fiduciary may not develop an opportunity using corporate resources, acquire an interest adverse to that of the corporation or acquire property that is reasonably incident to the present or prospective business of the corporation or in which the corporation has a present or expectancy interest, unless that opportunity is first presented to the corporation and the corporation chooses not to pursue that opportunity. The doctrine of corporate opportunity is intended to preclude officers, directors or other fiduciaries from personally benefiting from opportunities that belong to the corporation.\nTherefore, except as provided above, these Identified Persons (including Messrs. Carrel, Mitchell and Solorzano) have no duty to communicate or present corporate opportunities to us, have the right to either hold any corporate opportunity for their (and their affiliates\u2019) own account and benefit or to recommend, assign or otherwise transfer such corporate opportunity to persons other than us, and are not be prohibited from operating or investing in competing businesses. We therefore may find ourselves in competition with one or more of these Identified Persons, and we may not have knowledge of, or be able to pursue, transactions that could potentially be beneficial to us. Accordingly, we may lose a corporate opportunity or suffer competitive harm, which could negatively affect our business or prospects.\nWe may redeem unexpired warrants prior to their exercise at a time that is disadvantageous for warrant holders, thereby making such warrants worthless.\nWe have the ability to redeem outstanding warrants at any time prior to their expiration, at a price of\u2009 $0.01 per warrant, provided that the last reported sales price of the common stock equals or exceeds $18.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within a 30 trading-day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date we send the notice of redemption to the warrant holders. If and when the warrants become redeemable by us, we may exercise our redemption right even if we are unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws. Redemption of the outstanding warrants could force you to: (1) exercise your warrants and pay the related exercise price at a time when it may be disadvantageous for you to do so; (2) sell your warrants at the then-current market price when you might otherwise wish to hold your warrants; or (3) accept the nominal redemption price which, at the time the outstanding warrants are called for redemption, is likely to be substantially less than the market value of your warrants. None of the private placement warrants will be redeemable by us for cash so long as they are held by the Sponsor or its permitted transferees.\nIn addition, we may redeem your warrants (including private placement warrants) for a number of shares of common stock determined based on the redemption date and the fair market value of the common stock. Any such redemption may have similar consequences to a cash redemption described above. In addition, such redemption may occur at a time when the warrants are \u201cout-of-the-money\u201d, in which case you would lose any potential embedded value from a subsequent increase in the value of the common stock had your warrants remained outstanding.", "PERMNO": 18546, "SIC": 9995, "TIC": "ACAM"}
