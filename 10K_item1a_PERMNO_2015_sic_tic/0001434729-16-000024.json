{"cik": "1434729", "company": "HSN, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-24", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nThe risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks that may have a material adverse effect on HSNi. There exist additional risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business and our results. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected, and the market price for our shares could decline. Further, to the extent that any of the information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K constitutes forward-looking statements, the risk factors set forth below also are cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause the actual results of HSNi to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of HSNi.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur long-term success depends, in large part, on our continued ability to attract new and retain existing customers in a cost-effective manner.\nIn an effort to attract and retain customers, we engage in various marketing and merchandising initiatives, which involve the expenditure of considerable funds and resources, particularly in the case of the production and distribution of HSN television programming, Cornerstone catalogs and continuously updating our digital strategy. We have spent, and expect to continue to spend, increasing amounts of money on, and devote greater resources to, certain of these initiatives, particularly in connection with the growth and maintenance of our brands generally, as well as in the continuing efforts of our businesses to increasingly engage customers through digital channels. These initiatives, however, may not resonate with existing customers or consumers generally or may not be cost-effective. In addition, we believe that costs associated with the production and distribution of HSN television programming, paper and printing costs for Cornerstone catalogs and costs associated with digital marketing, including search engine marketing (primarily the purchase of relevant keywords) are likely to increase in the foreseeable future and, if significant, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations to the extent that they do not result in corresponding increases in sales.\nThe retail business environment is subject to intense competition, and we may not be able to effectively compete for customers.\nWe operate in a rapidly evolving and highly competitive retail business environment. We have numerous and varied competitors at the national and local levels, ranging from large department stores to specialty shops, electronic retailers, direct marketing retailers, wholesale clubs, discount retailers, other televised shopping retailers such as QVC and EVINE, infomercial retailers, internet retailers, and mail-order and catalog companies. Many of our current and potential competitors are larger, have greater resources, longer histories, more customers and greater brand recognition than we do. They may secure better terms from vendors, adopt more aggressive pricing, offer free or subsidized shipping and devote more resources to technology, fulfillment and marketing. Other companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions.\nWe also compete for access to customers and audience share with other providers of televised, online and hard copy entertainment and content. Our inability to compete effectively with regard to the assortment, price, shipping terms and quality of the merchandise we offer for sale or to keep pace with competitors in our marketing, service, location, reputation, credit availability and technologies, could have a material adverse effect.\nWe depend on relationships with pay television operators and adverse changes in these relationships could result in an interruption, material decrease or even the cessation of carriage of the HSN television networks.\nWe are dependent upon the pay television operators with whom we enter into distribution and affiliation agreements to carry the HSN television networks. We currently have contracts with many local and national pay television operators to distribute HSN television programming. Some of HSN\u2019s larger pay television operators include Comcast, AT&T/DirecTV, Echostar/DISH and Time Warner Cable. The two largest pay television operators represent 49% of our subscribers. The cessation of carriage of the HSN television networks by a major pay television operator or a significant number of smaller pay television operators for a prolonged period of time could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, the continued consolidation of the pay television operator industry could cause us to lose leverage when negotiating new agreements. While we believe that we will be able to continue to successfully manage the distribution process in the future, certain changes in distribution levels, as well as increases in fees payable for carriage, could occur notwithstanding these efforts.\nWe typically seek to enter into long-term distribution and affiliation agreements with these major pay television operators; however, in some cases, renewals are not agreed upon prior to the expiration of a given agreement and the HSN television networks continue to be carried by the relevant pay television operator without an effective agreement in place. We currently provide service to approximately 50% of our total subscribers pursuant to month-to-month contracts or contracts that have expired. In addition, another 33% of our total subscribers are represented by contracts that expire within one year. Renewal and negotiation processes with pay television operators are typically lengthy. No assurance can be given that we will be successful in negotiating renewals with all these operators or that the financial and other terms of renewal will be on acceptable terms. The failure to successfully renew or negotiate new distribution and affiliation agreements covering a material portion of the existing cable and satellite households on acceptable terms could adversely affect our growth, sales revenue and earnings.\nOur revenues and profit margin are negatively influenced by economic conditions that impact consumer spending. If macroeconomic conditions do not continue to improve or if conditions worsen, our business could be adversely affected.\nRetailers generally are particularly sensitive to adverse economic and business conditions, in particular to the extent they result in a loss of consumer confidence, rising unemployment, increased taxes and decreases in consumer spending, particularly discretionary spending. Our customers anticipate and respond to adverse changes in economic conditions. If macroeconomic conditions do not continue to improve or if conditions worsen, our business could be adversely affected.\nThe failure to attract and retain television viewers and secure a suitable programming tier of carriage and channel placement for the HSN television network programming could result in a decrease in revenue.\nWe are dependent, in part, upon the continued ability of HSN to compete effectively for television viewers. Effectively competing for television viewers is dependent, in substantial part, on the ability of HSN to secure placement of the HSN television networks within a suitable programming tier and to effectively compete against others for the leisure and entertainment time of consumers. The advent of digital compression technologies and the adoption of digital cable has resulted in increased channel capacity. In addition, there are now more programming options available to the viewing public in the form of new television networks and alternative distribution platforms and time-shifted viewing options (e.g., personal video recorders, video-on-demand, interactive television and streaming video over broadband internet connections as well as increased access to various media through wireless devices). These have the potential to reduce the viewing of our content. New technologies have been and will continue to be developed that increase the number of entertainment choices available and the manners in which they are delivered. Our failure to effectively anticipate or adapt to emerging technologies or changes in consumer behavior could have an adverse impact on our competitive position, business and results of operations.\nA prolonged or permanent inability to broadcast the HSN television networks would result in lost customers and lost sales.\nOur success is dependent upon the continued ability of HSN to transmit the HSN television networks to broadcast and pay television operators from its satellite uplink facilities, which transmission is subject to the Federal Communications Commission (\u201cFCC\u201d) compliance. HSN has entered into a satellite transponder agreement to provide for continued carriage of the HSN television networks on a replacement transponder and/or replacement satellite, as applicable, in the event of a failure of the transponder and/or satellite. Any such disruption could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business and results of operations.\nInterruption and the lack of integration and redundancy in our systems and infrastructures may adversely affect our ability to broadcast, operate websites, process and fulfill transactions, respond to customer inquiries and generally maintain cost-efficient operations.\nWe use the internet, mobile devices, social networking and other online activities to connect with our customers. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to maintain the integrity of our systems and infrastructures, including websites, information and related systems, call centers and fulfillment facilities. We may experience occasional system interruptions, including those caused by system conversions, that make some or all systems or data unavailable or prevent our businesses from efficiently providing services or fulfilling orders. We also rely on affiliate and third-party computer systems, broadband and other communications systems and service providers in connection with the provision of services generally, as well as to facilitate, process and fulfill transactions. Any interruptions, outages or delays in our systems and infrastructures, our businesses, our affiliates and/or third parties, or deterioration in the performance of these systems and infrastructures, could impair our ability to provide services, fulfill orders and/or process transactions. Fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, acts of war or terrorism, acts of God and similar events or disruptions may damage or interrupt broadcast, computer, broadband or other communications systems and infrastructures at any time. In addition, we have observed an increase in the number of cyber attacks that include gaining access to digital systems for purposes of corrupting data or causing operational disruption. Any of these events could cause system interruption, delays and loss of critical data, and could prevent us from providing services, fulfilling orders and/or processing transactions which could have an adverse impact on our competitive position, business and results of operations. While we have backup systems for certain aspects of our operations, these systems are not fully redundant and disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for all eventualities. In addition, we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a major interruption.\nThe processing, storage, use and disclosure of personal data could give rise to liabilities as a result of governmental regulation, conflicting legal requirements or differing views of personal privacy rights.\nIn the processing of consumer transactions, we receive, transmit and store a large volume of personally identifiable information and other user data. The sharing, use, disclosure and protection of this information are governed by the privacy and data security policies maintained by us. Moreover, there are federal, state and international laws regarding privacy and the storing, sharing, use, disclosure and protection of personally identifiable information and user data. Specifically, personally identifiable information is increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world, the intent of which is to protect the privacy of personal information that is collected, processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction. As a merchant who accepts credit and debit cards, we are subject to heightened payment card industry standards. These standards primarily pertain to the processes and procedures for secure storage of customer data. Failure to comply with these standards, as required by card issuers, could result in card brand fines and/or the possible inability for us to accept a card brand. We could be adversely affected if legislation or regulations are expanded to require changes in business practices or privacy policies, or if governing jurisdictions interpret or implement their legislation or regulations in ways that negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to online and other cyber security risks and cyber incidents, including security and data breaches and identity theft.\nTo succeed, we must be able to provide for secure transmission of confidential information over public networks. We have observed an increased number of cyber attacks that include attempts to gain unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information. Our failure, and/or the failure by the various third party vendors and service providers with which we do business, to comply with applicable privacy policies or federal, state or similar international laws and regulations or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release of personally identifiable information or other user data could damage the reputation of our businesses, discourage potential users from trying our products and services and/or result in fines and/or proceedings by governmental agencies and/or consumers, one or all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any penetration of network security or other misappropriation or misuse of personal consumer information could cause interruptions in the operations of our businesses and subject us to increased costs, litigation and other liabilities. Security and data breaches could also significantly damage our reputation with consumers and third parties with whom we do business. We may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against and remedy any potential or existing security and data breaches and their consequences. We also face risks associated with security and data breaches affecting third parties with which we are affiliated or otherwise conduct business online.\nWe could be subject to additional sales tax, property tax or unclaimed property liabilities.\nFederal and state law governs the imposition of obligations related to sales tax, property tax and unclaimed property. An unfavorable change in these laws or a successful assertion by one or more states may result in material liabilities including penalties and interest.\nThe imposition of obligations to collect state and local sales tax with respect to sales from out-of-state retailers is restricted by U.S. Supreme Court decisions as well as state law. As a result, approximately 34% of our revenue is not currently subject to sales tax or its equivalent. However, an increasing number of states have adopted or are considering laws that attempt to impose obligations on out-of-state retailers to collect sales tax on their behalf. Congress is also considering legislation allowing states to require out-of-state sellers to collect sales and use taxes. It is not possible to predict with any degree of certainty the outcome of these initiatives or the impact of these initiatives on our business and marketing strategies that we are considering or may consider in the future.\nAn unfavorable change in the U.S. Supreme Court guidance related to sales tax, or a successful assertion by one or more states may result in material tax liabilities, interest and penalties. A change in state or federal laws, or our business model, business strategy, or marketing initiatives may require us to collect sales tax on transactions in which we do not currently collect such tax. These developments, should they occur, may result in a decrease in future sales, may decrease our ability to compete, or otherwise harm our business.\nIncreased delivery costs, particularly if we are unable to offset them by increasing prices without a detrimental effect on customer demand, and the extent to which we offer shipping promotions to our customers, could adversely impact our profits.\nWe are impacted by increases in shipping rates charged by various shipping vendors relating to the procurement of merchandise from vendors and manufacturers, the shipment of merchandise to customers and the mailing of catalogs, which over the past few years have experienced volatility in comparison to historical levels. Variations in the mix and quantity of products we sell impact the cost to ship our products as do the shipping promotions we frequently offer to drive revenues. We currently expect that shipping and postal rates will continue to increase as well as the trend towards free shipping in the direct-to-consumer marketplace. In the case of deliveries to customers, we believe we have negotiated favorable shipping rates, which increase at agreed upon levels over time, with one independent, third party shipping company pursuant to a long-term contract. If this relationship were to terminate or if the shipping company was unable to fulfill its obligations under the contract for any reason, particularly during peak shipping seasons, we would have to work with other shipping companies to deliver merchandise to customers, which could be at less favorable rates and could cause a disruption in our business. A significant increase in shipping promotions as well as any increase in shipping rates and related fuel and other surcharges passed on to us by our shipping company may adversely impact profits given that we may not be able to pass these increased costs directly to customers or offset them by increasing prices without a detrimental effect on customer demand.\nWe depend on relationships with vendors, manufacturers and other third parties; any adverse changes in these relationships could result in a failure to meet customer expectations which could result in lost sales.\nWe purchase merchandise from a wide variety of third party vendors, manufacturers and other sources pursuant to short- and long-term contracts and purchase orders. Our ability to identify and establish relationships with these parties, as well as access quality merchandise in a timely and efficient manner on acceptable terms and at acceptable costs, can be challenging. In particular, we purchase a significant amount of merchandise from vendors and manufacturers abroad and have experienced (and expect to continue to experience) increased costs for goods sourced in these markets. We depend on the ability of vendors and manufacturers in the U.S. and abroad to produce and deliver goods that meet applicable quality standards, which is impacted by a number of factors not within the control of these parties, such as political or financial instability, trade restrictions, tariffs, currency exchange rates, transport capacity, labor actions and costs, among others. In particular, Cornerstone is dependent, in significant part, upon independent, third party manufacturers to produce its private label merchandise.\nOur failure to identify new vendors and manufacturers, maintain relationships with a significant number of existing vendors and manufacturers and/or access quality merchandise in a timely and efficient manner could cause us to miss customer delivery dates or delay scheduled promotions, which would result in the failure to meet customer expectations and could cause customers to cancel orders or cause us to be unable to source merchandise in sufficient quantities, which could result in lost sales.\nThe unanticipated loss of certain larger vendors could negatively impact our sales and profitability on a short term basis.\nIt is possible that one or more of our larger vendors could experience financial difficulties, including bankruptcy, or otherwise could elect to cease doing business with us. While we have periodically experienced the loss of a major vendor, if a major vendor or a number of our current larger vendors ceased doing business with us, or did not perform consistently with past practice, this could materially and adversely impact our sales and profitability.\nWe may not be able to accurately predict and/or respond in a timely manner to evolving customer preferences and trends and industry standards, which could result in excess inventory, related markdowns and lost sales.\nOur success depends, in significant part, on our ability to accurately predict, and respond in a timely manner to, changes in customer preferences and fashion, lifestyle and other trends and industry standards. While product mix and price points are continuously monitored and adjusted in an attempt to satisfy consumer demand and respond to changing economic and business conditions, we may not be successful in these efforts, and any sustained failure could result in excess inventory and related markdowns.\nIn addition, e-commerce is characterized by evolving industry standards, frequent new service and product introductions and enhancements, as well as changing customer demands and increasing privacy and data security needs. If we are not able to adapt quickly enough and/or in a cost-effective manner to these changes it could result in lost sales which would negatively impact our results of operations.\nWe are currently the subject of a consent order issued by the FTC and violation of this consent order could result in significant civil penalties and/or an injunction enjoining HSN from engaging in prohibited activities, among other penalties or remedies.\nIn October 1996, HSN became subject to a consent order issued by the FTC which terminates on the later of April 15, 2019, or 20 years from the most recent date that the United States or the FTC files a complaint in federal court alleging any violation thereunder. Pursuant to this consent order, HSNi (including its subsidiaries and affiliates) is prohibited from making claims for specified categories of products, including claims that a given product can cure, treat or prevent any disease or have an effect on the structure or function of the human body, unless it has competent and reliable scientific evidence to substantiate such claims. Violation of this consent order may result in the imposition of significant civil penalties for non-compliance and related redress to consumers and/or the issuance of an injunction enjoining us from engaging in prohibited activities. The FTC periodically investigates our business and operations on an ongoing basis for purposes of determining its compliance with the consent order.\nWe may be subject to claims for representations made in connection with the sale and promotion of merchandise or for harm experienced by customers who purchase merchandise from us.\nThe manner in which we sell and promote merchandise and related claims and representations made in connection with these efforts is regulated by federal, state and local law. We may be exposed to potential liability from claims by consumers or from federal, state and local regulators and law enforcement agencies, including, but not limited to, for personal injury, product safety, wrongful death and damage to personal property relating to merchandise sold and/or misrepresentation of merchandise features and/or benefits. In certain instances, we have the right to seek indemnification for related liabilities from our vendors and may require such vendors to carry minimum levels of product liability and errors and omissions insurance. These vendors, however, may be unable to obtain suitable coverage or maintain this coverage on acceptable terms; this insurance may provide inadequate coverage against all potential claims or may not even be available with respect to a particular claim. If insurance is insufficient or unavailable, our vendor may have insufficient resources to cover their indemnification obligations, or if our vendor ceases to do business, our results of operations could be negatively impacted. Even if vendors can satisfy their financial obligations, our brand and reputation could be negatively impacted.\nFailure to effectively manage our Flexpay program could result in unplanned losses.\nHSN offers Flexpay, a program which customers may pay for certain merchandise in two to six interest-free, monthly credit or debit card installments. This is an effective tool for driving sales, primarily for higher-priced items. We maintain allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments. While actual losses due to the inability of customers to make required payments have historically been within estimates, they may increase in a given period or exceed related estimates. As Flexpay usage continues to grow, we may experience these losses at greater rates, which will require us to maintain greater allowances for doubtful accounts of estimated losses than we have historically. To the extent that Flexpay losses exceed historical levels, our results of operations may be negatively impacted.\nWe may fail to protect our intellectual property rights within the full scope and manner available to us under applicable law or statute or may be accused of infringing upon the intellectual property rights of third parties.\nWe regard our intellectual property rights, including patents, service marks, trademarks and domain names, copyrights and trade secrets, as critical to our success. We rely heavily upon software, databases and other systemic components that are necessary to manage and support our business operations.\nWe are subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business, including claims of alleged infringement of the trademarks, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties. In addition, litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others. Any litigation of this nature, regardless of outcome or merit, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Patent litigation tends to be particularly protracted and expensive. Our failure to protect our intellectual property rights in a meaningful manner or challenges to related contractual rights could result in erosion of brand names and limit our ability to control marketing on or through the internet using our various domain names or otherwise, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to comply with existing laws, rules and regulations, or to obtain and maintain required licenses and rights could subject us to additional liabilities.\nWe market and provide a broad range of merchandise through television, digital, catalogs and other channels. As a result, we are subject to a wide variety of statutes, rules, regulations, policies and procedures in various jurisdictions which are subject to change at any time, including laws regarding product safety, consumer protection, privacy, the regulation of retailers generally, the importation, sale and promotion of merchandise and the operation of retail stores and warehouse facilities, as well as laws and regulations applicable to the internet and businesses engaged in digital commerce, such as those regulating the sending of unsolicited, commercial electronic mail. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines and/or proceedings against us by governmental agencies and/or consumers, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, unfavorable changes in the laws, rules and regulations applicable to us could decrease demand for merchandise offered by us, negatively impact our marketing efforts, increase costs, subject us to additional liabilities and/or otherwise adversely affect our businesses.\nOur leveraged capital structure may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and earnings per share.\nWe completed a leveraged recapitalization transaction during the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2015, which included increasing our level of indebtedness and the payment of a special cash dividend of approximately $524 million. The existence of increased debt could have important consequences including, among other things:\n\u2022\nrequire a more substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to use cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments, dividends, stock repurchases or other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions; or\n\u2022\nexpose us to the risk of increased interest rates for that portion of our borrowings under our credit facilities that are at variable interest rates.\nOur credit facility includes restrictive financial and non-financial covenants. Limitations imposed as a part of the debt, such as the availability of credit and the existence of restrictive covenants may, among other things, make it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations; and/or limit our ability to respond to business opportunities.\nThere are risks associated with our acquisitions.\nMergers and acquisitions entail a number of risks including, among other things, higher than anticipated acquisition costs and expenses, the difficulty and expense of integrating the operations and personnel of the companies and the potential loss of key employees and customers as a result of changes in management. We may not be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with any acquisition.\nAcquisition valuations require us to make certain estimates and assumptions to determine the fair value of the acquired entities (including the underlying assets and liabilities). If our estimates or assumptions used to value acquired assets and liabilities are not accurate, we may be exposed to losses that may be material.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe shareholders\u2019 rights plan adopted by the Board of Directors in December 2008 may inhibit takeovers that would otherwise be beneficial to shareholders.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2008, our Board of Directors approved the creation of a Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, adopted a shareholders\u2019 rights plan and declared a dividend of one right for each outstanding share of common stock held by our shareholders. Initially, these rights, which trade with the shares of our common stock, are not exercisable. Under the rights plan, these rights will be exercisable if a person or group acquires or commences a tender or exchange offer for 15% or more of our common stock (except for certain grandfathered persons to which higher thresholds apply). If the rights become exercisable, each right will permit the holder, other than the \u201cacquiring person,\u201d to purchase from us shares of common stock at a 50% discount to the then prevailing market price. As a result, the rights will cause substantial dilution to a person or group that becomes an \u201cacquiring person\u201d on terms not approved by our Board of Directors. The existence of these rights may prevent, discourage or delay us from being acquired, even if such acquisition would be beneficial to our shareholders.\nThe market price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile and may face negative pressure.\nOur stock price has experienced, and could continue to experience in the future, substantial volatility as a result of many factors, including persistent adverse macroeconomic conditions, broad market fluctuations and public perception of the prospects for the retail industry. Our failure to meet market expectations would also likely result in a decline in the market price of our stock. These and other factors may result in short-term or long-term negative pressure on the value of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 92771, "SIC": 5961, "TIC": "HSNI"}
