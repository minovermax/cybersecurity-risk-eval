These factors include but are not limited to the following, which you should consider carefully in evaluating our business and prospects. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects may be materially and adversely affected.\nSummary\n\u2022\nWe are dependent on the success of larsucosterol (also called DUR-928) and the path to regulatory approval is uncertain; we cannot be certain that it will ever receive regulatory approval or be commercialized\n\u2022\nFast Track Designation for larsucosterol in AH may not actually lead to faster FDA review or an approval\n\u2022\nSafety data and indications of activity from completed larsucosterol clinical trials may not predict safety, activity or efficacy in future trials\n\u2022\nOpen-label trials of larsucosterol in NASH and AH have inherent limitations\n\u2022\nOngoing and future clinical trials for larsucosterol may be delayed and may not demonstrate efficacy or safety\n\u2022\nWe may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of our product candidates\n\u2022\nKey components of larsucosterol are provided by a limited number of suppliers, and supply shortages or loss of these suppliers could result in delays or interruptions in supply or increased costs\n\u2022\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has impacted and may adversely impact our business for the foreseeable future, including posing challenges to conducting clinical trials\n\u2022\nWe have a significant amount of debt. Compliance with repayment obligations and other covenants may be difficult; failure to fulfill our obligations may cause the repayment obligations to accelerate\n\u2022\nWe will require and may have difficulty or be unsuccessful in raising needed capital in the future\n\u2022\nWe do not control the commercialization of POSIMIR, PERSERIS or Methydur\n\u2022\nFor certain of our product candidates, we depend on third-party collaborators, and we have limited or no control over their development, regulatory strategy or potential commercialization\n\u2022\nCancellation of collaborations may adversely affect potential economic benefits\n\u2022\nIf we do not enter into new collaboration agreements, our revenues and/or cash flows will be reduced relative to prior periods\n\u2022\nOur cash flows are likely to differ from our reported revenues\n\u2022\nOur business strategy includes entering into additional collaborative agreements to support development, clinical trials, manufacturing and commercialization of product candidates. We may not be able to successfully negotiate or enter into acceptable collaboration agreements\n\u2022\nFailure to comply with governmental regulations could materially harm our business\n\u2022\nWe have a history of operating losses, expect to continue to have losses and may never achieve profitability; and we may not successfully manage our company through varying business cycles\n\u2022\nWe may develop our own sales force and commercial group to market future products, but we have limited sales and marketing experience and may not be able to do so effectively\n\u2022\nWrite-offs related to impairment of goodwill, long-lived assets, inventories and other non-cash charges may adversely impact profitability and cause cash flows to differ from reported revenues\n\u2022\nGlobal credit and financial market conditions could negatively impact the value of our investments\n\u2022\nWe depend upon key personnel who may terminate their employment with us at any time, and we may not be able to attract and retain sufficient qualified personnel\n\u2022\nCyber-attacks or other failures in telecommunications or information technology systems could result in information theft, data corruption and significant disruption of our business operations\n\u2022\nOur corporate headquarters, certain manufacturing facilities and personnel are located in a seismically active area near wildfire zones; our business also involves environmental risks and risks related to handling regulated substances\n\u2022\nAs a non-accelerated filer, we are not required to comply with auditor attestation requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and, consequently, investors may find our common stock less attractive\n\u2022\nIf we are unable to protect, maintain or enforce our IP rights or secure rights to third-party IP, we may lose valuable assets, lose market share or incur costly litigation or our third-party collaborators may choose to terminate their agreements with us, which may depend on our IP\n\u2022\nWe may be sued by third parties claiming that our products or product candidates infringe on their IP rights, particularly because there is substantial uncertainty about the validity and breadth of biopharmaceutical patents\n\u2022\nCompetitive products or technologies could impair our ability to establish, maintain or grow our business\n\u2022\nOur relationships with physicians, patients and third-party payers are subject to anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, privacy and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm and diminished profits and future earnings\n\u2022\nWe could be exposed to significant product liability claims and we are subject to healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages and reputational harm\n\u2022\nHealthcare reform measures could hinder or prevent our product candidates\u2019 commercial success\n\u2022\nMarket acceptance of our products or product candidates is uncertain, and failure to achieve market acceptance or adequate reimbursement from third-party payers will harm our future revenues and profitability\n\u2022\nInability to train physicians to use our products may prevent market acceptance of our products\n\u2022\nRisks related to actions on trade by the U.S. and foreign governments, new accounting pronouncements and legislative actions could adversely affect the Company's results of operations and financial condition\n\u2022\nOur operating history makes evaluating our stock difficult, the price of our stock may be volatile\n\u2022\nInvestors may experience substantial dilution of their investment\n\u2022\nOur ability to use net operating losses and other tax attributes is uncertain and may be limited\n\u2022\nWe have broad discretion over the use of our cash and investments, which may not always yield a favorable return\n\u2022\nOur certificate of incorporation, bylaws and Delaware law could discourage an acquisition of us\n\u2022\nHaving Delaware as the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes\n\u2022\nOur stock price currently does not meet the minimum bid price for continued listing on Nasdaq.\nRisks Related To Our Business\nWe are dependent on the success of larsucosterol and the path to regulatory approval is uncertain; we cannot be certain that it will receive regulatory approval or be commercialized\nOur business depends substantially on the successful development of larsucosterol, which has completed multiple clinical trials, including a Phase 1b clinical trial in NASH and a Phase 2a clinical trial in AH, and is currently enrolling patients for a Phase 2b clinical trial (AHFIRM) in patients with severe AH. Ongoing and future clinical trials will need to establish clinically and statistically significant proof of efficacy, and sufficient evidence of safety to support filing for regulatory approval and/or additional clinical trials and ultimately regulatory approval. Larsucosterol will require additional development, including completion of ongoing clinical trials and potentially additional clinical trials as well as potentially further preclinical studies, and other non-clinical parameters, to obtain regulatory clearances before it can be commercialized. Positive results obtained during early development do not necessarily mean later development will succeed or that regulatory clearances or approvals will be obtained. Our drug development efforts may not lead to commercial drugs, for several reasons such as if larsucosterol fails to be shown to be safe and effective or if we do not have adequate financial or other resources to advance larsucosterol through clinical development and the approval processes. We consider larsucosterol to be our lead and most important asset. If larsucosterol fails to demonstrate safety or efficacy at any time or during any phase of development, we would experience potentially significant delays in, or be required to abandon, development of larsucosterol, which would materially harm our business. Even if the Phase 2b AHFIRM trial successfully demonstrates a survival benefit over placebo, (1) additional clinical trial(s) may be required to support an NDA filing and ultimately to support approval by FDA and/or other regulatory bodies; and (2) accelerated regulatory pathways (such as an FDA priority review designation) may not be available.\nWe do not anticipate that larsucosterol will be eligible to receive regulatory approval from the FDA or comparable foreign authorities and begin commercialization for a number of years, if ever. Even if we ultimately receive regulatory approval for larsucosterol, we or our potential future partners, if any, may be unable to commercialize it successfully for a variety of reasons. These include, for example, the availability of alternative, potentially superior or less expensive treatments, lack of cost-effectiveness, the lack of favorable access and/or commercial pricing, the cost or technical challenges of manufacturing the product on a commercial scale and competition with other treatments. The success of larsucosterol may also be limited by the prevalence and severity of any adverse side effects, including mortality. If we fail to obtain regulatory approval and successfully commercialize larsucosterol, we may be unable to raise sufficient capital or generate sufficient revenues to attain or maintain profitability, and our financial condition and stock price may decline.\nFast Track designation of larsucosterol by the FDA may not actually lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval\nThe FDA grants Fast Track designation to therapies that are considered capable of addressing unmet medical needs and possess the potential to treat serious or life-threatening disease conditions in order to facilitate its development and expedite the review procedure. Even though larsucosterol has received Fast Track designation for the treatment of AH, we may not experience a faster development process, review or approval compared to conventional FDA procedures, or receive FDA approval at all, in that indication or any other. A Fast Track designation does not change the standards for approval. The FDA may also withdraw Fast Track designation if it believes that the designation is no longer supported by data from our clinical development program.\nSafety data and indications of activity from completed Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials of larsucosterol may not predict safety, activity or therapeutic efficacy in future trials\nAlthough Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials of larsucosterol have shown positive initial data in AH patients, including reductions in bilirubin and MELD scores from baseline and promising Lille scores, and demonstrated in NASH patients that larsucosterol may lead to the reduction from baseline in liver enzymes, liver stiffness and serum lipids as well as certain biomarkers, such initial results, indications of activity and biomarker changes as well as favorable tolerability may ultimately not be correlated with\ntreatment or improvement in the associated disease, and there is a risk that larsucosterol may not demonstrate therapeutic efficacy in larger placebo-controlled trials such as AHFIRM, despite encouraging initial data and improvements in biomarker levels in smaller, early trials. The failure of larsucosterol to show efficacy in one indication may negatively affect its perceived value in other indications, and the emergence of safety signals in ongoing or future clinical trials would significantly harm our business.\nOpen-label trials of larsucosterol in NASH and AH have inherent limitations\nThe most recently completed NASH and AH trials of larsucosterol were open-label trials with no control groups. Open label trials have inherent risk of bias given that the patients and physicians know that the patients received active study drug, which can lead to placebo effects. Trials without control groups have an inherent risk in that the comparisons used to determine the study drug\u2019s effect and side effect profile are based on comparisons with baseline (pre-treatment) levels (for blood chemistry and biomarker endpoints) and/or with historical controls, which may not have been conducted under similar enough conditions to make accurate comparisons and/or draw accurate conclusions from those comparisons. Additionally, larger placebo-controlled clinical trials are required to evaluate the safety and efficacy of larsucosterol to treat any indication, including AH and NASH. There can be no assurance that ongoing or future studies will demonstrate the safety or efficacy of larsucosterol in a statistically significant or clinically meaningful manner.\nOngoing and future clinical trials for larsucosterol in AH may be delayed and may not demonstrate efficacy or safety in the indications tested\nThe Phase 2b AHFIRM trial of larsucosterol in patients with AH is subject to potential delays resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic as well as timing of entering contracts with clinical sites and contract research organizations, obtaining institutional review board approvals and delays in other activities that need to be put in place prior to clinical trial initiation at each clinical trial site. Given uncertainty of COVID-19-related impacts on clinical trial sites in the U.S., U.K., E.U. and Australia, the timing of availability of top-line data from this trial cannot be predicted with certainty. There can be no assurance that the trial will enroll as anticipated if at all, and delays in enrollment could add to the costs and expenses of this trial and harm our business. There can also be no assurance that biological activity demonstrated in previous animal disease models or earlier clinical trials of larsucosterol will also be seen in ongoing trials or future clinical trials, or that any clinically relevant biological activity will be observed, or that enrollment rates will be favorable or that these additional trials will not identify safety issues. Failure of the AHFIRM trial to achieve desired results in its anticipated timeframe would negatively impact our business and ability to raise additional capital.\nWe may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of larsucosterol or any other product candidate\nWe may experience delays in completing our preclinical studies and initiating or completing clinical trials, and we may experience numerous unfavorable events during, or as a result of, any future clinical trials that we could conduct that could delay or prevent our ability to receive marketing approval or commercialize our product candidates, including:\n\u2022\nregulators or institutional review boards, or IRBs, or ethics committees may not authorize us or our investigators to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at one or more prospective trial sites;\n\u2022\nwe may experience delays in reaching, or fail to reach, agreement on acceptable terms with prospective trial sites and prospective contract research organizations, or CROs, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites. We may be forced to accept unfavorable contract provisions in such agreements based on country, territory or local laws or requirements of institutions or IRBs where important clinical investigators practice;\n\u2022\nclinical trials of our product candidates may produce negative or inconclusive results, clinical trial subjects receiving placebo or standard of care may experience better than expected outcomes, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional preclinical studies or clinical trials or we may decide to abandon product development programs;\n\u2022\nnon-compliance by clinical trial sites or clinical investigators with the study protocol or applicable laws;\n\u2022\nthe number of patients required for clinical trials of our product candidates may be larger than we anticipate, enrollment in these clinical trials may be slower than we anticipate, or participants may drop out of these clinical trials or fail to return for post-treatment follow-up at a higher rate than we anticipate;\n\u2022\nour third-party contractors may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner, or at all, or may deviate from the clinical trial protocol or drop out of the trial, which may require that we add new clinical trial sites or investigators;\n\u2022\nwe may elect to, or regulators or IRBs or ethics committees may require us or our investigators to, suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements or a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;\n\u2022\nthe cost of clinical trials of our product candidates may be greater than we anticipate;\n\u2022\nthe supply or quality of our product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials of our product candidates may be insufficient or inadequate; and\n\u2022\nour product candidates may have undesirable side effects or other unexpected characteristics, causing us or our investigators, regulators or IRBs or ethics committees to suspend or terminate the trials, or reports may arise from preclinical or clinical testing of other therapies that raise safety or efficacy concerns about our product candidates\nWe could encounter delays if a clinical trial is suspended or terminated by us, by the IRBs of the institutions at which such trials are being conducted, by the Data Safety Monitoring Board, or DSMB, for such trial or by the FDA or other regulatory authorities. Such authorities may impose such a suspension or termination or clinical hold due to a number of factors, including failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols, inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial site by the FDA or other regulatory authorities, safety issues or adverse side effects, failure to demonstrate a benefit from using a product, changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions or lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial. Many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of our product candidates. Further, the FDA may disagree with our clinical trial design and our interpretation of data from clinical trials, or may change the requirements for approval even after it has reviewed and commented on the design for our clinical trials.\nOur product development costs will also increase if we experience delays in testing or regulatory approvals. We do not know whether any of our future clinical trials will begin as planned, or whether any of our current or future clinical trials will need to be restructured or will be completed on schedule, if at all. Significant preclinical study or clinical trial delays, including those caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, also could shorten any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidates or allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do and impair our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates and may harm our business and results of operations. Any delays in our ongoing or future preclinical or clinical development programs may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly.\nKey components of larsucosterol are provided by a limited number of suppliers, and supply shortages or loss of these suppliers could result in delays or interruptions in supply or increased costs\nWhile we have entered into contract manufacturing agreements with multiple vendors for larsucosterol, we currently have a third-party sole supplier for GMP supplies of larsucosterol. This third party is our sole source for the drug product required for development and commercialization of this drug candidate.\nThe reliance on a sole or limited number of suppliers could result in:\n\u2022\nan inability to obtain an adequate supply of larsucosterol;\n\u2022\ndelays associated with finding and contracting with a new supplier (if we can find one capable of replacing the old supplier and negotiate commercially reasonable terms) and then transferring the know-how and technology required to perform the services to the new supplier; and\n\u2022\nreduced control over pricing, quality and delivery time.\nThere can be no assurance that we will receive sufficient quantities of larsucosterol to commence and conduct the non-clinical trials, clinical trials and CMC activities we are planning, and delays in supply could delay development of larsucosterol. In addition, certain of our third-party manufacturers and suppliers may be experiencing delays as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or have otherwise encountered delays in providing their goods and services. As a result, we may not be able to manufacture our product candidates for our clinical trials and conduct other research and development operations and maintain current clinical and pre-clinical timelines. In addition, if additional third parties in our supply chain are adversely impacted by restrictions resulting from the pandemic, including staffing shortages, raw material shortages, production slowdowns and/or disruptions in delivery systems, our supply chain may be disrupted in other ways, further limiting our ability to manufacture our product candidates for our clinical trials and conduct our research and development operations.\nWe have supply agreements in place for certain components of our products and product candidates, but do not have in place long term supply agreements with respect to all of the components of any of our products or product candidates. Therefore, the supply of a particular component could be terminated without DURECT\u2019s consent at any time without penalty to the supplier. In addition, we may not be able to procure required components or drugs from third-party suppliers at a commercially reasonable quantity, quality, cost and timing. In addition, certain of our suppliers may be experiencing delays as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or have otherwise encountered delays in providing their services. Any interruption in the supply of single source components (including active pharmaceutical ingredients, excipients, or components like vials, stoppers, filters and the like), products or product candidates, could cause us to seek alternative sources of supply or attempt to manufacture these items internally if feasible. Furthermore, in some cases, we are relying on our third-party collaborators to procure supply of necessary components. If the supply of any components for our products or product candidates is interrupted, components from alternative suppliers may not be available in sufficient volumes or at acceptable quality levels within required timeframes, if at all, to meet our needs or those of our third-party collaborators. This could delay our ability to obtain commercial product supplies or complete development and obtain approval for commercialization and marketing of our product candidates, causing us to lose sales, incur additional costs, delay new product introductions and could harm our reputation and make access to capital more difficult, expensive or impossible. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected and is likely to continue to affect the manufacturing and shipment of goods globally. Many countries have imposed or are imposing certain restrictions on the movement of people and goods and may continue to lift and reimpose such restrictions as needed. Any delay in production or delivery of the components and drug substances used in our products or product candidates for any reason, including due to an extended closure of our suppliers\u2019 plants as a result of efforts to limit the spread of COVID-19, could adversely impact our business and hinder our growth.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has impacted and may adversely impact our business for the foreseeable future\nThe global COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted our operations and delayed our clinical trials. In particular, the COVID-19 pandemic delayed the initiation of our AHFIRM Phase 2b clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of larsucosterol in severe alcohol-associated hepatitis (AH) patients, and it has delayed and may in the future delay the pace of enrollment in this trial and other clinical trials. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been and may continue to be longer lead times required for acquiring components and supplies used in manufacturing of larsucosterol, and there have been periods of reduced demand for our ALZET products, which are used in scientific and pre-clinical research. In addition, COVID-19 may have an adverse impact on the economies and financial markets of many countries, resulting in a severe and prolonged global economic downturn that could continue to affect demand for our ALZET product line and impact our operating results. The COVID-19 pandemic may also adversely impact our ability to raise additional capital to provide sufficient funding to continue our\nproduct development efforts, including clinical trials. COVID-19 initially had an adverse impact on the capital markets and could again, which would make it more difficult for companies such as ours to access capital. The extent to which the pandemic impacts our operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration and severity of the pandemic, the impact of new variants of the virus, and the actions that may be required to contain the COVID-19 virus or treat its impact. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we may continue to experience disruptions that could severely impact our business, preclinical studies and clinical trials including:\n\u2022\ndelays or difficulties in enrolling patients in our clinical trials;\n\u2022\ndelays or difficulties in clinical site initiation, including difficulties in recruiting clinical site investigators and clinical site staff;\n\u2022\ndiversion of healthcare resources away from the conduct of clinical trials, including the diversion of hospitals serving as our clinical trial sites and hospital staff supporting the conduct of our clinical trials;\n\u2022\ninterruption of key clinical trial activities, such as clinical trial site data monitoring, due to limitations on travel imposed or recommended by federal, state or local governments, employers and others or interruption of clinical trial subject visits and study procedures, which may impact the integrity of subject data and clinical study endpoints, the ability to collect, ship and analyze biological samples from clinical trial patients due to concerns about potential contamination of samples and/or exposure of clinical staff to patients with COVID-19;\n\u2022\ninterruption or delays in the operations of the FDA or other regulatory authorities, which may impact review and approval timelines;\n\u2022\ndisruption or delays in manufacturing of clinical and commercial supplies due to issues experienced by our contract manufacturing organizations and/or shortages and delays in obtaining raw materials and supplies required in the manufacturing processes;\n\u2022\ninterruption of or delays in receiving supplies of our products and product candidates from our contract manufacturing organizations due to staffing shortages, production slowdowns or stoppages, prioritization of pandemic-related activities over ours and disruptions in delivery systems;\n\u2022\ninterruptions in preclinical studies due to restricted or limited operations at laboratory facilities;\n\u2022\nlimitations on employee resources that would otherwise be focused on the conduct of our preclinical studies, clinical trials, and manufacturing activities including because of sickness of employees or their families or the desire of employees to avoid contact with groups of people; and\n\u2022\nmaterial delays and complications with respect to our research and development programs.\nWe may not successfully manage our company through varying business cycles, including the COVID-19 pandemic\nOur success will depend on properly sizing our company through growth and contraction cycles caused in part by changing business conditions, which places a significant strain on our management and on our administrative, operational and financial resources. For example, in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, we required most of our personnel, including all of our administrative employees, to work remotely, restricted on-site staff to only those personnel who must perform activities that must be completed on-site, implemented social distancing on-site, and closed certain of our offices temporarily. Our increased reliance on personnel working from home may negatively impact\nproductivity, or disrupt, delay, or otherwise adversely impact our business. In addition, this could increase our cyber security risk, create data accessibility concerns, and make us more susceptible to communication disruptions, any of which could adversely impact our business operations or delay necessary interactions with the FDA, manufacturing sites, research or clinical trial sites. To manage through such cycles, we may expand or contract our facilities, our operational, financial and management systems and our personnel. If we were unable to manage growth and contractions effectively our business would be harmed.\nThe path to regulatory approval of larsucosterol is uncertain\nLarsucosterol is in clinical development for the potential treatment of AH; NASH is also being explored. In AH and NASH, there are no currently approved drugs. We will have to interact with the FDA and other regulatory agencies regarding important aspects of the clinical development program, potentially including the size and design of clinical trials, the specific primary and secondary endpoints for the clinical trials, inclusion and exclusion criteria, stopping rules, duration of follow up, size of the safety databases, statistical analysis plans and other matters. This uncertainty may make it difficult to predict the timing or expense required to obtain regulatory approval for larsucosterol. We also may need to revise our clinical development plans after trials have commenced or been completed, which could add to the time and expense associated with the clinical development of larsucosterol. If we are unable to reach agreement with the FDA or other regulatory agencies regarding clinical development plans for larsucosterol, we may curtail or limit our development activities for this product candidate.\nDelays or difficulties in the enrollment of subjects in clinical trials may increase our overall development expenses and delay clinical trial data and receipt of necessary regulatory approvals\nSuccessful and timely completion of clinical trials will require that we enroll a sufficient number of subjects and/or patients within a reasonable period of time. Enrollment, a significant factor in the timing of clinical trials, is affected by many factors including the size and nature of the patient population, our ability to recruit clinical sites and the ability of clinical sites to successfully recruit subjects to participate in clinical trials. Initiation of and enrollment in many clinical trials has been and is being adversely affected by COVID-19, which has at times caused some institutions to stop enrolling patients, has created a large number of clinical trial proposals for potential clinical trial sites to review and consider, and has caused many individuals to avoid contact with hospitals or other healthcare providers. Additionally, some of the patients in our clinical trials, including AH patients, are hospitalized and concerns about exposure to COVID-19 limit clinical trial staff\u2019s access to patients, the frequency of interactions between patients and staff, the ability to obtain blood draws and other biological sample collection, and may limit the ability to ship samples to outside laboratories for analysis. In areas heavily impacted by COVID-19, there may be limited hospital staff available for clinical trial activities due to staff becoming infected or due to de-prioritization of clinical trial activities. Trials may be subject to delays as a result of patient enrollment taking longer than anticipated or patient withdrawal. We may not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials for larsucosterol if we are unable to sign and maintain sufficient clinical sites, locate and enroll a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in these trials as required by the FDA or other regulatory authorities or if we are unable to collect and analyze biological samples required for trial endpoints. It is possible that the inclusion and exclusion criteria for patients to be enrolled in these trials or COVID-19-related issues may make the trials more difficult to conduct or may significantly extend the time required for enrollment and the cost of these trials.\nWe cannot predict how successful we will be at enrolling patients in our clinical trials. Enrollment is affected by many factors including:\n\u2022\nthe eligibility criteria for the trial in question;\n\u2022\nthe prevalence and incidence of the conditions being studied;\n\u2022\nCOVID-19-related challenges with patient access, hospital prioritization, clinical trial staff availability, ability to collect, ship and analyze patients\u2019 biological samples, availability of personal protective equipment (PPE), swabs, reagents and other materials and supplies;\n\u2022\nthe perceived risks and benefits of our product candidates;\n\u2022\nclinicians\u2019 and patients\u2019 perceptions as to the potential advantages of the product candidate being studied in relation to other available therapies, including any new drugs or therapeutic biologics that may be approved for the indications we are investigating;\n\u2022\nthe efforts to facilitate timely enrollment in clinical trials;\n\u2022\ncompetition for clinical sites and patients from other clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe willingness of potential clinical trial patients to provide informed consent to participate in the trial;\n\u2022\nthe patient referral practices of physicians;\n\u2022\nthe ability to monitor patients adequately during and after treatment; and\n\u2022\nthe proximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective patients.\nOur inability to sign up and maintain sufficient clinical trial sites and/or enroll a sufficient number of patients for clinical trials would result in significant delays and could require us to abandon one or more clinical trials altogether. Enrollment delays in these clinical trials may result in increased development costs for our drug candidates or delays in regulatory filings and approvals, which would cause the value of our company to decline and limit our ability to obtain additional financing.\nThe FDA or other regulatory agencies may require more information or clinical studies for all of our product candidates, and our product candidates may never be approved\nThe failure to adequately demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of a pharmaceutical product candidate under development to the satisfaction of FDA and other regulatory agencies will result in delays to the regulatory approval or non-approvability of our product candidates, and could materially harm our business. Clinical trials may not demonstrate the sufficient levels of safety and efficacy necessary to obtain the requisite regulatory approvals for our product candidates, or may require such significant numbers of patients or additional costs to make it impractical to satisfy the regulatory agency\u2019s requirements, and thus our product candidates may not be approved for marketing. During the review process, the FDA or other regulatory agencies may request additional information regarding the efficacy or safety of our product candidates, and providing such additional information could require significant additional work and expense, and take a significant amount of time, resulting in a material delay of approval or the failure to obtain approval or lead the company to abandon the development of that product candidate. During the review process, the FDA, or other regulatory agencies, may also request more information regarding the chemistry, manufacturing or controls related to our product candidates, and answering such questions could require significant additional work and expense, and take a significant amount of time, resulting in a material delay of approval or the failure to obtain approval or abandonment of the product candidate. Additionally, even if our product candidates receive FDA or other regulatory agency approval, the regulatory agency may require that we conduct additional clinical or non-clinical studies after such approval, place limitations on the use of our products in applicable labels, require marketing under a REMS program, include commercially unattractive language in the approved product label, delay approval to market our products or limit the indicated use of our products, which may harm our business and results of operations.\nWe currently have a significant amount of debt. Compliance with repayment obligations and other covenants may be difficult, and failure by us to fulfill our obligations under the applicable loan agreements may cause the repayment obligations to accelerate\nIn July 2016, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the Loan Agreement) with Oxford Finance LLC (Oxford Finance), pursuant to which Oxford Finance provided a $20 million secured single-draw term loan to us with an initial maturity date of August 1, 2020. The term loan was fully drawn at close and the proceeds may be used for working capital and general business requirements. The term loan repayment schedule provided initially for interest only payments for the first 18 months, followed by consecutive monthly payments of principal and interest in arrears starting on March 1, 2018 and continuing through the maturity date of August 1, 2020. Following five amendments, we make interest only payments under the amended Loan Agreement until June 1, 2023 and the final maturity date of the\nloan is September 1, 2025. The Loan Agreement provides for a floating interest rate (7.95% initially and 7.95% as of December 31, 2021) based on an index rate plus a spread and an additional payment equal to 10% of the principal amount of the term loan, which is due when the term loan becomes due or upon the prepayment of the facility. Any increases in prevailing interest rates could increase our expenses under the Loan Agreement. If we elect to prepay the loan, there is also a prepayment fee between 0.75% and 2.5% of the principal amount of the term loan depending on the timing of prepayment. Our debt repayment obligations under the Loan Agreement, as amended, may prove a burden to the Company as they become due, particularly following the expiration of the interest-only period.\nThe Loan Agreement contains customary events of default, including, among other things, our failure to fulfill certain of our obligations under the Loan Agreement and the occurrence of a material adverse change in our business, operations or condition (financial or otherwise), a material impairment of the prospect of repayment of any portion of the loan, the failure to deliver an unqualified audit report and board approved financial projections within time periods set forth in the Loan Agreement, or a material impairment in the perfection or priority of lender\u2019s lien in the collateral or in the value of such collateral. In the event of default by us under the Loan Agreement, the lender would be entitled to exercise its remedies thereunder, including the right to accelerate the debt, upon which we may be required to repay all amounts then outstanding under the Loan Agreement, which could harm our business, operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, the term loan is secured by substantially all of our assets, except that the collateral does not include any equity interests in the Company, any intellectual property (including all licensing, collaboration and similar agreements relating thereto), and certain other excluded assets. The Loan Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants by us, which covenants limit our ability to convey, sell, lease, transfer, assign or otherwise dispose of certain of our assets; engage in any business other than the businesses currently engaged in by us or reasonably related thereto; liquidate or dissolve; make certain management changes; undergo certain change of control events; create, incur, assume, or be liable with respect to certain indebtedness; grant certain liens; pay dividends and make certain other restricted payments; make certain investments; make payments on any subordinated debt; and enter into transactions with any of our affiliates outside of the ordinary course of business or permit our subsidiaries to do the same. Complying with these covenants may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy.\nWe will require and may have difficulty or be unsuccessful in raising needed capital in the future\nOur business currently does not generate sufficient revenues to meet our capital requirements and we do not expect that it will do so in the near future. We have expended and will continue to expend substantial funds to conduct the research, development, manufacturing and clinical testing of our product candidates, funding and establishing additional clinical- and commercial-scale manufacturing arrangements and facilities, and to provide for the pre-commercial and commercial activities associated with the marketing, sales and distribution of our products and product candidates. We will require additional funds for these purposes. Additional funds may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all, and such availability will depend on a number of factors, some of which are outside of our control, including general capital markets conditions and investors\u2019 view of our prospects and valuation. If adequate funds are unavailable from operations or additional sources of financing, we may have to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of the above-mentioned activities which would materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe believe that our cash, cash equivalents and investments and anticipated revenues will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for at least the next 12 months from December 31, 2021. However, our independent auditors may not agree with this assessment, and our actual capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022\ncontinued progress and cost of our research and development programs;\n\u2022\nprogress with preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals, if any;\n\u2022\ncosts involved in establishing manufacturing capabilities for pre-clinical, non-clinical, clinical and commercial quantities of our products and product candidates;\n\u2022\nsuccess in entering into collaboration agreements and achieving milestones under such agreements;\n\u2022\nthe continuation of our collaborative agreements that provide financial funding for certain of our activities;\n\u2022\nregulatory actions with respect to our and our collaborators\u2019 products and product candidates;\n\u2022\ncosts involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\ncosts of developing sales, marketing and distribution channels and our ability and that of our collaborators to sell our products, products we have a financial interest in and eventually, product candidates;\n\u2022\ncompeting technological and market developments;\n\u2022\nmarket acceptance of our products, products we have a financial interest in and, eventually, product candidates;\n\u2022\nany failure to comply with the covenants in our debt instruments that results in acceleration of repayment obligations;\n\u2022\nimpacts of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022\ncosts for recruiting and retaining employees and consultants; and\n\u2022\nunexpected legal, accounting and other costs and liabilities related to our business.\nWe may consume available resources more rapidly than currently anticipated, resulting in the need for additional funding. We may seek to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings, convertible debt financings, collaborative arrangements with corporate collaborators or other sources, which, in each case, may be dilutive to existing stockholders and may cause the price of our common stock to decline. In addition, in the event that additional funds are obtained through arrangements with collaborators or other sources, we may have to relinquish rights to some of our technologies, products or product candidates that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves. If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to significantly reduce or refocus our product development efforts and other activities, resulting in delays in generating future revenue.\nWe do not control the commercialization of POSIMIR, PERSERIS or Methydur\nWe rely on Innocoll for the commercialization of POSIMIR. The current approved labeling for POSIMIR is limited, and Innocoll is responsible for completing post-marketing non-clinical studies and any additional studies required by FDA, and negative results from these studies could adversely affect commercialization of POSIMIR. Innocoll is also responsible for manufacturing POSIMIR. If Innocoll does not successfully launch and then grow POSIIMIR sales, the royalty payments we receive under our agreement with them will be limited and we may not receive any milestone payments from them. We rely on Indivior for the commercialization of PERSERIS. There can be no assurance that PERSERIS sales will maintain current levels or grow materially. If Indivior does not successfully grow PERSERIS sales, future earn-out payments we receive under our agreement with them will be limited. We rely on Orient Pharma for the commercialization of Methydur. If Orient Pharma does not successfully grow Methydur sales, the royalty payments we receive under our agreement with them will be limited. The sales of each of these products may be negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nFor certain of our product candidates, we depend to a large extent on third-party collaborators, and we have limited or no control over the development, sales, distribution and disclosure for those product candidates\nOur performance for certain of our product candidates depends to a large extent on the ability of our third-party collaborators to successfully develop and obtain regulatory approvals. We have entered into agreements with Innocoll, Indivior, Santen and Orient Pharma under which we granted such third parties the right to develop, apply for regulatory approval for, market, promote or distribute certain products or product candidates, subject to payments to us in the form of product royalties, earn-out and other payments. We have limited or no control over the expertise or resources that any collaborator may devote to the development, clinical trial strategy, regulatory approval, marketing or sale of these product candidates, or the timing of their activities. Any of our present or future collaborators may not perform their obligations as expected. These collaborators may breach or terminate their agreement with us or otherwise fail to conduct their collaborative activities successfully and in a timely manner. Enforcing any of these agreements in the event of a breach by the other party could require the expenditure of significant resources and consume a significant amount of management time and attention. Our collaborators may also conduct their activities in a manner that is different from the manner we would recommend or would have chosen, had we been developing such product candidates ourselves. Further, our collaborators may elect not to develop or commercialize product candidates arising out of our collaborative arrangements or not devote sufficient resources to the development, clinical trials, regulatory approval, manufacture, marketing or sale of these product candidates. If any of these events occur, we may not recognize revenue from the commercialization of our product candidates based on such collaborations. In addition, these third parties may have similar or competitive products to the ones which are the subject of their collaborations with us, or relationships with our competitors, which may reduce their interest in developing or selling our products or product candidates. We may not be able to control public disclosures made by some of our third-party collaborators, which could negatively impact our stock price.\nCancellation of collaborations regarding our product candidates may adversely affect potential economic benefits\nThird-party collaboration agreements typically allow the third party to terminate the agreement (or a specific program within an agreement) at will by providing notice. Termination can result from failure of the collaboration to achieve anticipated milestones, from changes in strategy of the other party or for other reasons. In these cases, the product rights revert to us or certain rights of the partner to use our proprietary technology are terminated. If there have been payments under such agreements that are being recognized over time, termination of such agreements (or programs) can lead to a near-term increase in our reported revenues resulting from the immediate recognition of the balance of such payments. Termination deprives us of potential future economic benefits under such agreements, and may make it more difficult, unattractive or impossible to enter into agreements with other third parties for use of the assets and/or technologies that were subject to the terminated agreement. For example, termination of our agreements with Innocoll, Santen or Orient Pharma could have negative effects on the Company.\nIf we do not enter into new collaboration agreements, our revenues and/or cash flows will be reduced relative to prior periods\nOur revenues have been based to a significant extent on collaborative arrangements with third parties, pursuant to which we receive payments based on our performance of research and development activities set forth in these agreements. For example, approximately 58% of our total revenues in 2019 were derived from our collaboration agreement with Gilead. In June 2020, Gilead notified us that they were terminating this collaboration, resulting in accelerated recognition of $22.7 million in deferred revenue related to a nonrefundable upfront license fee and a milestone payment totaling $35.0 million that had previously been received. In addition, we have seen periodic fluctuations in revenues associated with our other collaboration agreements, which reflect the current development stage of the product candidates subject to those agreements, and our collaborator\u2019s needs for our services. Long-term growth of our collaboration revenues requires us to enter into new collaboration agreements, and there can be no assurance that we will do so. Even if we enter into new collaboration agreements, we may not be able to fulfill our obligations or attain milestones set forth in any specific agreement, which could cause our revenues and/or cash flows to fluctuate or be less than anticipated and may expose us to liability for contractual breach. In addition, these agreements may require us to devote significant time and resources to communicating with and managing our relationships with such collaborators and resolving possible issues of contractual interpretation which may detract from time our management would otherwise devote to managing our operations. Such agreements are generally complex and contain provisions that could give rise to legal disputes, including potential disputes concerning ownership of intellectual property. Such disputes can delay or prevent the development of potential new product candidates, or can lead to lengthy, expensive litigation or arbitration. In general, our collaboration agreements, may be terminated by the other party at will or upon specified conditions including, for example, if we fail to satisfy specified performance milestones or if we breach the terms of the agreement. Acquisitions of our collaborators or strategic changes or re-organizations or re-prioritizations of our collaborators can lead to turnover of program staff, a review of development programs and strategies by the acquirer, and other events that can disrupt a program, resulting in program delays or discontinuations.\nIf we do not enter into new collaboration agreements, our anticipated revenues and/or cash flows will be reduced relative to periods of increased R&D revenues, such as occurred in 2020.\nOur cash flows are likely to differ from our reported revenues\nOur revenues will likely differ from our cash flows from revenue-generating activities. Upfront payments received upon execution of collaborative agreements may be recorded as deferred revenue, in which case they are generally recognized over the period of our performance obligations with the third-party collaborator pursuant to the applicable agreement. The period of performance obligations may also be revised on a prospective basis. As of December 31, 2021, we had $910,000 of deferred revenue which will be recognized in future periods and may cause our reported revenues to be greater than cash flows from our ongoing revenue-generating activities. Assumptions related to revenue recognition of deferred revenue are reviewed in each accounting period and changes are recorded in the current period. In certain circumstances, changes in assumptions related to the timing and amount of work required to complete a performance obligation tied to deferred revenue can result in negative revenue for an accounting period or the accelerated recognition of non-cash revenue.\nOur business strategy includes the entry into additional collaborative agreements. We may not be able to enter into additional collaborative agreements or may not be able to negotiate commercially acceptable terms for these agreements\nOur current business strategy includes the entry into additional collaborative agreements for the development and commercialization of our products and product candidates, including, but not limited to larsucosterol and others. The negotiation and consummation of these types of agreements typically involve simultaneous discussions with multiple potential collaborators and require significant time and resources from our officers, business development, legal, and research and development staff. In addition, in attracting the attention of pharmaceutical and biotechnology company collaborators, we compete with numerous other third parties with product opportunities as well as the collaborators\u2019 own internal product opportunities. We may not be able to consummate additional collaborative agreements, or we may not be\nable to negotiate commercially attractive terms for these agreements. If we do not consummate additional collaborative agreements, we may have to consume money more rapidly on our product development efforts, defer development activities or forgo the exploitation of certain opportunities, abandon development of certain product candidates or indications for certain product candidates, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFailure to comply with ongoing governmental regulations for our products or product candidates could materially harm our business\nDeveloping, manufacturing, marketing or promoting a drug is subject to very strict regulations and controls. Furthermore, clearance or approval may entail ongoing requirements for post-marketing studies or surveillance. The manufacture and marketing of drugs are subject to continuing FDA and foreign regulatory review and requirements that we update our regulatory filings. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, manufacturer or facility, or our failure to update regulatory files, may result in restrictions, including withdrawal of the product from the market. Any of the following or other similar events, if they were to occur, could delay or preclude us from further developing, marketing or realizing full commercial value of our products or product candidates, which in turn would materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations:\n\u2022\nfailure to obtain or maintain requisite governmental approvals;\n\u2022\nfailure to meet GMP, GLP and/or other governmental requirements for drug development;\n\u2022\nfailure to obtain approvals for commercially valuable intended uses of our products and product candidates; or\n\u2022\nFDA required product withdrawals, clinical holds or warnings arising from identification of serious adverse side effects in our products and product candidates.\nManufacturers of drugs must comply with the applicable FDA good manufacturing practice (GMP) regulations, which include production design controls, testing, quality control and quality assurance requirements as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Compliance with current GMP regulations is difficult and costly. Manufacturing facilities are subject to ongoing periodic inspection by the FDA and corresponding state and in some cases, foreign agencies, including unannounced inspections, and must be licensed before they can be used for the commercial manufacture of our products and product candidates. We and/or our present or future suppliers and distributors may be unable to comply with the applicable GMP regulations and other FDA and/or foreign regulatory requirements. If we, our third-party collaborators or our respective suppliers do not achieve compliance for our products or product candidates we or they manufacture, the FDA or foreign equivalents may refuse or withdraw marketing clearance or approvals, put our or our partner\u2019s clinical trial on hold, withdraw or reject an investigational new drug (IND) application or require product recall, which may cause interruptions or delays in the development, manufacture and sale of our products and product candidates.\nWe have a history of operating losses, expect to continue to have losses in the future and may never achieve or maintain profitability\nWe have incurred significant operating losses since our inception in 1998 and, as of December 31, 2021, had an accumulated deficit of approximately $526.0 million. We expect to continue to incur significant operating losses over the next several years as we continue to incur significant costs for research and development, clinical trials, manufacturing, sales, and general and administrative functions. Our ability to achieve profitability depends upon our ability, alone or with others, to successfully complete the development of our proposed product candidates, obtain the required regulatory clearances, manufacture and market our proposed product candidates and successfully commercialize our approved products. Development of pharmaceutical product candidates is costly and requires significant investment. In addition, we may choose to license from third parties either rights to particular drugs or other appropriate technology and/or intellectual property rights for use in our products and product candidates. The license fees as well as the operating costs of using or developing these technologies or rights would increase the costs of our products and product candidates as well as our operating costs generally.\nTo date, we have not generated significant revenue from royalties, earn-out payments, milestone payments or the commercial sale of our products or product candidates and do not expect to do so in the near future. Our current revenues are from the ALZET product line, from certain excipient sales, from earn-out payments from Indivior related to sales of PERSERIS, from royalty payments from Orient Pharma related to sales of Methydur in Taiwan, and from payments under collaborative research and development agreements with third parties. We do not expect our product revenues to increase significantly in the near future, and we do not expect that collaborative research and development revenues will exceed our operating expenses in the near future. We do not anticipate meaningful revenues to derive from the commercialization and marketing of our products and product candidates in the near future, do not expect to receive meaningful royalties from POSIMIR until the product has been successfully launched and achieves meaningful sales (if ever) and therefore do not expect to generate sufficient revenues to cover expenses or achieve profitability in the near future.\nChanges in tax law could adversely affect our business and financial condition\nThe rules dealing with U.S. federal, state, and local income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the IRS and the U.S. Treasury Department. Changes to tax laws (which changes may have retroactive application) could adversely affect us or holders of our common stock. In recent years, many such changes have been made and changes are likely to continue to occur in the future. For example, on March 11, 2021, President Biden signed into law the \u201cAmerican Rescue Plan Act\u201d, which included extenders to the refundable employee retention credit under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act and limitations to executive compensation effective for tax years beginning after 2026. Future changes in tax laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may develop our own sales force and commercial group to market future products but we have limited sales and marketing experience with respect to pharmaceuticals and may not be able to do so effectively\nWe have a small sales and marketing group focused on our ALZET product line. We may choose to develop our own sales force and commercial group to market larsucosterol, if approved, or other products that we may develop in the future. Developing a sales force and commercial group would require substantial expenditures and the hiring of qualified personnel. We have limited sales and marketing experience, and may not be able to effectively recruit, train or retain sales and marketing personnel. If we are not able to put in place an appropriate sales force and commercial group for our products in development and provide that commercial team with sufficient financial and other resources, we may not be able to effectively launch or commercialize these or any other products. We may not be able to effectively sell our products and product candidates, if approved, and our failure to do so could limit or materially harm our business.\nWe and our third-party collaborators may not sell our product candidates effectively\nWe and our third-party collaborators (including Innocoll, Indivior and OP Pharma) compete with many other companies that currently have extensive and well-funded marketing and sales operations. Our marketing and sales efforts and those of our third-party collaborators may be unable to compete successfully against these other companies. We and our third-party collaborators, where applicable, may be unable to establish a sufficient sales and marketing organization on a timely basis, if at all. We and our third-party collaborators, where applicable, may be unable to engage qualified distributors. Even if engaged, these collaborators and distributors may:\n\u2022\nfail to adequately market our products or product candidates;\n\u2022\nfail to satisfy financial or contractual obligations to us;\n\u2022\ncease operations, terminate our collaboration or re-allocate resources away from our products or product candidates with little or no notice to us;\n\u2022\noffer, design, manufacture or promote competing product lines;\n\u2022\nfail to maintain adequate inventory and thereby restrict use of our products or product candidates; or\n\u2022\nbuild up inventory in excess of demand thereby limiting future purchases of our products of product candidates resulting in significant quarter-to-quarter variability in our sales.\nThe failure of us or our third-party collaborators to effectively develop, gain regulatory approval for, sell, manufacture and market our products and product candidates will hurt our business, prospects, financial results and may impact our access to capital.\nWe rely heavily on third parties to support development, clinical testing and manufacturing of our products and product candidates\nWe rely on third-party contract research organizations, consultants, service providers and suppliers to provide critical services to support development, clinical testing, and manufacturing of our products and product candidates. For example, we currently depend on third-party vendors to manage and monitor most of our clinical trials. We rely on third-parties to manufacture or perform manufacturing steps relating to our products, product candidates and components. We anticipate that we will continue to rely on these and other third-party contractors to support development, clinical testing, and manufacturing of our products and product candidates. These third parties may not execute their responsibilities and tasks competently in compliance with their contractual obligations to us, applicable laws and regulations or in a timely or cost-effective fashion. Failure of these contractors to provide the required services in a competent or timely manner or on reasonable commercial terms could materially delay the development and approval of our product candidates or commercialization of our products, increase our expenses and materially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and access to capital.\nWrite-offs related to the impairment of our goodwill, long-lived assets, inventories and other non-cash charges, as well as stock-based compensation expenses may adversely impact or delay our profitability\nWe may incur significant non-cash charges related to impairment write-downs of our long-lived assets, including goodwill. We are required to perform periodic impairment reviews of our goodwill at least annually. The carrying value of goodwill on our balance sheet was $6.2 million at December 31, 2021. To the extent these reviews conclude that the expected future cash flows generated from our business activities are not sufficient to recover the cost of our long-lived assets, we will be required to measure and record an impairment charge to write-down these assets to their realizable values. We completed our last review during the fourth quarter of 2021 and determined that goodwill was not impaired as of December 31, 2021. However, there can be no assurance that upon completion of subsequent reviews a material impairment charge will not be recorded. If future periodic reviews determine that our assets are impaired and a write-down is required, it will adversely impact or delay our profitability.\nInventories, in part, include certain excipients that are sold to customers and included in products and product candidates in development. These inventories are capitalized based on management\u2019s judgment of probable sale prior to their expiration date which in turn is primarily based on management\u2019s internal estimates. The valuation of inventory requires us to estimate the value of inventory that may become expired prior to use. We may be required to expense previously capitalized inventory costs upon a change in our judgment, due to, among other potential factors, a denial or delay of approval of a product by the necessary regulatory bodies, changes in product development timelines, or other information that suggests that the inventory will not be saleable.\nGlobal credit and financial market conditions could negatively impact the value of our current portfolio of cash equivalents, short-term investments or long-term investments and our ability to meet our financing objectives\nOur cash and cash equivalents are maintained in highly liquid investments with remaining maturities of 90 days or less at the time of purchase. Our short-term investments consist primarily of readily marketable debt securities with original maturities of greater than 90 days from the date of purchase but remaining maturities of less than one year from the balance sheet date. Our long-term investments consist primarily of readily marketable debt securities with maturities of one year or beyond from the balance\nsheet date. While, as of the date of this filing, we are not aware of any downgrades, material losses, or other significant deterioration in the fair value of our cash equivalents, short-term investments or long-term investments since December 31, 2021, no assurance can be given that deterioration in conditions of the global credit and financial markets would not negatively impact our current portfolio of cash equivalents, short-term investments or long-term investments or our ability to meet our financing objectives.\nWe depend upon key personnel who may terminate their employment with us at any time. We may need to hire additional qualified personnel and may not be able to do so on a timely basis, if at all\nOur success will depend to a significant degree upon the continued services of key management, technical and scientific personnel. In addition, our success will depend on our ability to attract and retain other highly skilled personnel, particularly as we develop and expand our Epigenetic Regulator Program. Competition for qualified personnel is intense, and the process of hiring and integrating such qualified personnel is often lengthy. The market for qualified personnel in the San Francisco Bay Area is very competitive and we may be unable to recruit such personnel on a timely basis, if at all. Our management and other employees may voluntarily terminate their employment with us at any time. Current job market dynamics, where the number of workers who quit their job in a single month in 2021 has broken multiple all-time U.S. records (referred to as the \"Great Resignation\"), further increases the challenge of employee retention. The loss of the services of key personnel, or the inability to attract and retain additional qualified personnel, could result in delays to product development or approval, loss of sales and diversion of management resources as well as difficulties or inability to raise sufficient capital to fund the Company\u2019s operations.\nOur business involves environmental risks and risks related to handling regulated substances\nIn connection with our research and development activities and our manufacture of materials, products and product candidates, we are subject to federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations and policies governing the use, generation, manufacture, storage, air emission, effluent discharge, handling and disposal of certain materials, biological specimens and wastes. Although we believe that we have complied with the applicable laws, regulations and policies in all material respects and have not been required to correct any material noncompliance, we may be required to incur significant costs to comply with environmental and health and safety regulations in the future. Our research and development involves the use, generation and disposal of hazardous materials, including but not limited to certain hazardous chemicals, solvents, agents and biohazardous materials. Although we believe that our safety procedures for storing, handling and disposing of such materials comply with the standards prescribed by state and federal regulations, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. We currently contract with third parties to dispose of these substances generated by us, and we rely on these third parties to properly dispose of these substances in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. If these third parties do not properly dispose of these substances in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, we may be subject to legal action by governmental agencies or private parties for improper disposal of these substances. The costs of defending such actions and the potential liability resulting from such actions are often very large. In the event we are subject to such legal action or we otherwise fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations governing the use, generation and disposal of hazardous materials and chemicals, we could be held liable for any damages that result, and any such liability could exceed our resources.\nCyber-attacks or other failures in telecommunications or information technology systems could result in information theft, data corruption and significant disruption of our business operations\nWe utilize information technology, systems and networks to process, transmit and store electronic information in connection with our business activities. As use of digital technologies has increased, cyber incidents, including deliberate attacks and attempts to gain unauthorized access to computer systems and networks, have increased in frequency and sophistication. These threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data, and may cause a disruption in our operations, harm our reputation, cause us to pay to retrieve our data if it becomes infected or otherwise subject to ransomware, and increase our stock trading risk. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in preventing cyber-attacks or successfully mitigating their effects.\nSimilarly, there can be no assurance that our third-party collaborators, distributors and other contractors and consultants will be successful in protecting our clinical and other data that is stored on their systems. Any cyber-attack or destruction or loss of data could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects. In addition, we may suffer reputational harm or face litigation or adverse regulatory action as a result of cyber-attacks or other data security breaches and may incur significant additional expense to implement further data protection measures.\nOur corporate headquarters, certain manufacturing facilities and personnel are located in a geographical area that is seismically active and near wildfire zones\nOur corporate headquarters, certain manufacturing facilities and personnel are located in a geographical area that is known to be seismically active and prone to earthquakes, as well as wildfires and related power outages or power shortages. Should such a natural disaster or power outage or power shortage occur, our ability to conduct our business could be severely restricted, and our business and assets, including the results of our research, development and manufacturing efforts, could be harmed or destroyed.\nAs a non-accelerated filer, we are not required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and, consequently, some investors may find our common stock less attractive\nWe are a non-accelerated filer as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, and as such, are not required to provide an auditor attestation of management\u2019s assessment of internal control over financial reporting, which is generally required for SEC reporting companies under Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Therefore, our internal controls over financial reporting will not receive the level of review provided by the process relating to the auditor attestation included in annual reports of issuers that are subject to the auditor attestation requirements. Because we are not required to have our auditors provide an attestation of our management\u2019s assessment of internal control over financial reporting, a material weakness in internal control may remain undetected for a longer period. In addition, if investors may find our common stock less attractive because we are not required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and the trading price for our common stock as well as our ability to raise capital may be negatively affected.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to adequately protect, maintain or enforce our intellectual property rights or secure rights to third-party patents, we may lose valuable assets, experience reduced market share or incur costly litigation to protect our rights or our third-party collaborators may choose to terminate their agreements with us\nOur ability to commercially exploit our products will depend significantly on our ability to obtain and maintain patents, maintain trade secret protection and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others.\nAs of March 3, 2022, we owned or exclusively in-licensed over 25 unexpired issued U.S. patents and over 135 unexpired issued foreign patents (which include granted European patent rights that have been validated in various EU member states). In addition, we have over 30 pending U.S. patent applications and over 145 foreign applications pending in Europe, Australia, Japan, Canada and other countries.\nThere can be no assurance that the pending patent applications will be granted. Further, there can be no assurance that VCU will not attempt to terminate their license to us, which termination could result in the loss of our rights to certain of these patent families.\nThe patent positions of pharmaceutical companies, including ours, are uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued. Consequently, our patent applications or those that are licensed to us may not issue into patents, and any issued patents may not provide protection against competitive technologies or may be held invalid if challenged. Our competitors may also independently develop products similar to ours or design around or otherwise circumvent patents issued to us or licensed by us. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as U.S. law, if at all.\nWe also rely upon trade secrets, technical know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We require our employees, consultants, advisors and collaborators to execute confidentiality and assignment-of-inventions agreements with us. These agreements typically provide that all materials and confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual\u2019s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances, and that all inventions arising out of the individual\u2019s relationship with us will be our exclusive property. These agreements may be breached, and in some instances, we may not have an appropriate remedy available for breach of the agreements. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques, reverse engineer our information and techniques, or otherwise gain access to our proprietary technology.\nWe may be unable to meaningfully protect our rights in trade secrets, technical know-how and other non-patented technology. We may have to resort to litigation or arbitration to protect our intellectual property rights, or to determine their scope, validity or enforceability. In addition, interference, derivation, post-grant oppositions, and similar proceedings may be necessary to determine rights to inventions in our patents and patent applications. Enforcing or defending our proprietary rights is expensive, could cause diversion of our resources and may be unsuccessful. Any failure to enforce or protect our rights could cause us to lose the ability to exclude others from using our technology to develop or sell competing products. In addition, in some circumstances our collaborators have the first right to enforce our patents against third party infringers, and such collaborators may not enforce such claims adequately or successfully or in the manner that we would do ourselves.\nOur collaboration agreements may depend on our intellectual property\nWe are party to collaborative agreements with Innocoll, Orient Pharma and Santen among others. Our third-party collaborators have entered into these agreements based on the exclusivity that our intellectual property rights confer on the products being developed. The loss or diminution of our intellectual property rights could result in a decision by our third-party collaborators to terminate their agreements with us. In addition, these agreements are generally complex and contain provisions that could give rise to legal disputes, including potential disputes concerning ownership of intellectual property and data under collaborations. Such disputes can lead to lengthy, expensive litigation or arbitration requiring us to devote management time and resources to such disputes which we would otherwise spend on our business.\nWe may be sued by third parties claiming that our products or product candidates infringe on their intellectual property rights, particularly because there is substantial uncertainty about the validity and breadth of biopharmaceutical patents\nWe or our collaborators may be exposed to future litigation by third parties based on claims that our products, product candidates or activities infringe the intellectual property rights of others or that we or our collaborators have misappropriated the trade secrets of others. This risk is exacerbated by the fact that the validity and breadth of claims covered in medical technology, pharmaceutical and biotechnology patents and the breadth and scope of trade secret protection involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles are unresolved. Any litigation or claims against us or our collaborators, whether or not valid, could result in substantial costs, could place a significant strain on our financial resources and could harm our reputation and business prospects. We also may not have sufficient funds to litigate, particularly against parties with substantially greater resources. In addition, pursuant to our collaborative agreements, we have provided our collaborators with the right, under\nspecified circumstances, to defend against any claims of infringement of the third-party intellectual property rights, and such collaborators may not defend against such claims adequately or successfully or in the manner that we would do ourselves. Intellectual property litigation or claims could force us or our collaborators to do one or more of the following, any of which could harm our business or financial results:\n\u2022\ncease selling, incorporating or using any of our products or product candidates that incorporate the challenged intellectual property;\n\u2022\nobtain a license from the holder of the infringed intellectual property right, which license may be costly or may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all; or\n\u2022\nredesign our products or product candidates, which would be costly and time-consuming and may not be successful.\nRisks Related To Our Industry\nThe markets for our pharmaceutical products, product candidates and for our ALZET product line are rapidly changing and competitive, and new products or technologies developed by others could impair our ability to establish, maintain or grow our business and remain competitive\nThe pharmaceutical industry is subject to rapid and substantial technological change. Developments by others may render our products, product candidates under development or technologies noncompetitive or obsolete, or we may be unable to keep pace with technological developments or other market factors. Technological competition in the industry from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, universities, governmental entities and others diversifying into the field is intense and is expected to increase.\nWe may face competition from other companies in numerous industries including pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, medical devices and drug delivery. Competition for larsucosterol, if approved, will depend on the specific indication(s) for which larsucosterol is approved. 89Bio, AbbVie, Afimmune, Akaza Bioscience, Akero Therapeutics, Ascletis, AstraZeneca, Axcella Health, Bristol Myers Squibb, Cirius Therapeutics, CytoDyn, Dr. Falk Pharma, Eli Lilly, Enanta, ENYO Pharma, Evive Biotech, Galectin, Galmed, Genentech, Genfit, Gilead, Hanmi, HighTide Biopharma, Intercept, Inventiva Pharma, Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Isotechnika, Kowa, LifeMax, Lipidio, Lipocine, Madrigal, MediciNova, MedImmune, Mitsubishi Tanabe, NGM Biopharmaceuticals, Nimbus, NorthSea Therapeutics, Novartis, Novo Nordisk, Pfizer, PharmaKing, Poxel, Promethera Biosciences, Seal Rock Therapeutics, Surrozen, Terns Pharmaceutical, Thera Technologies, Viking Therapeutics, and others have development plans for products to treat NAFLD/NASH, AH or other liver diseases.\nCompetition for our ALZET product line primarily consists of customers choosing to utilize delivery methods for their research projects other than an osmotic pump. We also face competition for our ALZET product line from other companies including low cost foreign competitors.\nWe are engaged in the development of novel therapeutic technologies. Our resources are limited and we may experience technical challenges inherent in such novel technologies. Competitors have developed or are in the process of developing technologies that are, or in the future may be, the basis for competitive products. Some of these products may have an entirely different approach or means of accomplishing similar therapeutic effects than our products and product candidates. Our competitors may develop products that are safer, more effective or less costly than our products and product candidates and, therefore, present a serious competitive threat to our product candidates and product offerings.\nThe widespread acceptance of therapies that are alternatives to ours may limit market acceptance of our products and product candidates if commercialized. Post-operative pain is currently being treated by oral medication, transdermal drug delivery systems, such as drug patches, long-acting and short-acting injectable products and implantable drug delivery devices which will be competitive with our products and product candidates. Many of these treatments are widely accepted in the medical community and have a long history of use. The established use of these competitive products may limit the potential for our products and product candidates to receive widespread acceptance if and when commercialized.\nOur relationships with physicians, patients and third-party payers are subject to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, privacy and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm and diminished profits and future earnings\nHealthcare providers, physicians and third-party payers will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of POSIMIR and any additional product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Our future arrangements with third-party payers and customers may expose us and our partners to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we and our partners may market, sell and distribute our products. As a pharmaceutical company, even though we do not and may not control referrals of healthcare services or bill directly to Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payers, federal and state healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse and patients\u2019 rights are and will be applicable to our business. These regulations include:\n\u2022\nthe Federal Healthcare Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid, and which will constrain our marketing practices and the marketing practices of our licensees, educational programs, pricing policies, and relationships with healthcare providers or other entities;\n\u2022\nthe federal physician self-referral prohibition, commonly known as the Stark Law, which prohibits physicians from referring Medicare or Medicaid patients to providers of \u201cdesignated health services\u201d with whom the physician or a member of the physician\u2019s immediate family has an ownership interest or compensation arrangement, unless a statutory or regulatory exception applies;\n\u2022\nfederal false claims laws that prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other government reimbursement programs that are false or fraudulent, and which may expose entities that provide coding and billing advice to customers to potential criminal and civil penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, and including as a result of claims presented in violation of the Federal Healthcare Anti-Kickback Statute, the Stark Law or other healthcare-related laws, including laws enforced by the FDA;\n\u2022\nthe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and also created federal criminal laws that prohibit knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services, and which as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n\u2022\nfederal physician sunshine requirements under the Affordable Care Act, which requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report annually to HHS\ninformation related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians, other healthcare providers, and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and other healthcare providers and their immediate family members and applicable group purchasing organizations;\n\u2022\nthe Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which, among other things, strictly regulates drug product marketing, prohibits manufacturers from marketing drug products for off-label use and regulates the distribution of drug samples;\n\u2022\nstate and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non- governmental third-party payers, including private insurers, state laws requiring pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government and which may require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by federal laws such as HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts; and\n\u2022\nHIPPA and other state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information or other personal information, such as the European Union General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, (EU 2016/679), which require limitations regarding access and use of certain personal and health information.\nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare and privacy laws and regulations do and will in the future involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare or privacy laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business are found to not be in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs.\nHealthcare reform measures could hinder or prevent our product candidates\u2019 commercial success\nIn the United States and some non-U.S. jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of our product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities, affect our ability to profitably sell any product or product candidates for which we obtain marketing and otherwise affect our future revenue and profitability and the future revenue and profitability of our collaborators or potential collaborators.\nFor example, in March 2010, the Affordable Care Act was enacted in the United States to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. The law appears likely to continue the downward pressure on the pricing of medical items and services, especially under the Medicare program, and increased the industry\u2019s regulatory burdens and operating costs.\nThe previous U.S. presidential administration signed two Executive Orders designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the Affordable Care Act. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the Affordable Care Act. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the Affordable Care Act have been signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the Affordable Care Act on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the \u201cindividual mandate.\u201d As legislative and regulatory developments are ongoing, we cannot predict the ultimate content, timing or effect of healthcare reform legislation or the impact of potential legislation on our business.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. These changes include reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year that will remain in effect through 2027; the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. More recently, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products. For example, the marketing, pricing and sale of the Company\u2019s products are subject to regulation, investigations and legal actions including under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program under the Affordable Care Act, which has increased the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the program as well as a new methodology by which rebates are owed for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected. We are also subject to federal and state false claims acts, as well as federal and state antitrust and consumer protection laws. Increased scrutiny of health care industry business practices in recent years by government agencies and state attorneys general in the U.S., and any resulting investigations and prosecutions, carry risk of significant civil and criminal penalties including, but not limited to, debarment from participation in such government healthcare programs.\nIndividual states in the United States have also become increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product and medical device pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. For example, in October 2017, California passed a new law, effective in January 2019, which requires transparency from biopharmaceutical companies regarding price increases for prescription drugs. In addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and medical devices to purchase and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other healthcare programs.\nWe expect that the Affordable Care Act, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria, new payment methodologies and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved or cleared product. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad. If we or our partners are slow or unable to adapt to new requirements or policies, or if we or our partners are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, our products and product candidates may lose any regulatory approval that may have been obtained, which would reduce the likelihood that we may achieve or sustain profitability, or be able to enter attractive collaboration agreements, which would adversely affect our business.\nWe could be exposed to significant product liability claims which could be time consuming and costly to defend, divert management attention and adversely impact our ability to obtain and maintain insurance coverage\nThe testing, clinical development, manufacture, marketing and sale of our products and product candidates involve an inherent risk that product liability claims will be asserted against us. Although we are insured against such risks up to an annual aggregate limit in connection with clinical trials and commercial sales of our products and product candidates, our present product liability insurance may be\ninadequate and may not fully cover the costs of any claim(s) or any ultimate damages we might be required to pay. Product liability claims or other claims related to our products and product candidates, regardless of their outcome, could require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or to pay significant damages. Any successful product liability claim may prevent us from obtaining adequate product liability insurance in the future on commercially desirable or reasonable terms. In addition, product liability coverage may cease to be available in sufficient amounts or at an acceptable cost. An inability to obtain sufficient insurance coverage at an acceptable cost or otherwise to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of our products or product candidates if and when approved. A product liability claim could also significantly harm our reputation and delay or prevent market acceptance of our products and product candidates.\nAcceptance of our products and product candidates in the marketplace is uncertain, and failure to achieve market acceptance will delay our ability to generate or grow revenues\nOur future financial performance will depend upon the successful introduction and customer acceptance of our products or products we have licensed to others, including larsucosterol, if approved, POSIMIR, if commercially launched, and including Indivior\u2019s PERSERIS and Orient Pharma\u2019s Methydur. Even if approved for marketing, these products and product candidates may not achieve market acceptance. The degree of market acceptance will depend upon a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe degree of unmet need in the market for the approved indication(s);\n\u2022\nthe receipt of regulatory clearance of marketing claims for the uses that we are developing;\n\u2022\nthe approved product labeling;\n\u2022\npricing, reimbursement and formulary access;\n\u2022\nthe degree of resources applied to promotion and other commercial activities;\n\u2022\nthe establishment and demonstration in the medical community of the safety and clinical efficacy of our products and their potential advantages over existing therapies; and\n\u2022\npricing, access and reimbursement policies of government and third-party payors such as insurance companies, health maintenance organizations, hospital formularies and other health plan administrators.\nPhysicians, patients, payers or the medical community in general may be unwilling to accept, utilize or recommend any of the products we have developed. If these products do not achieve widespread market acceptance, we will not achieve meaningful revenues.\nIf users of our products are unable to obtain adequate reimbursement from third-party payers, obtain access to our product(s), or if new restrictive legislation is adopted, market acceptance of our products may be limited and we may not achieve meaningful revenues or profitability\nThe continuing efforts of government and insurance companies, health maintenance organizations and other payers of healthcare costs to contain or reduce costs of health care may affect our future revenues and profitability, and the future revenues and profitability of our potential customers, suppliers and third-party collaborators and the availability of capital. For example, in certain foreign markets, pricing, access and/or profitability of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to government control. In the United States, recent federal and state government initiatives have been directed at lowering the total cost of health care, and the U.S. Congress and state legislatures will likely continue to focus on health care reform, the cost of prescription pharmaceuticals and on the reform of the Medicare and Medicaid systems. While we cannot predict whether any such legislative or regulatory proposals will be adopted, the announcement or adoption of such proposals could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe successful commercialization of our current and future products will depend in part on the extent to which appropriate reimbursement levels for the cost of our products and related treatment are obtained from governmental authorities, private health insurers and other organizations, such as HMOs. Third-party payers often limit access, payments and/or reimbursement for medical products and services. Also, the trend toward managed health care in the United States and the concurrent growth of organizations such as HMOs, which could control or significantly influence the purchase of health care services and products, as well as legislative proposals to reform health care or reduce government\ninsurance programs, may limit access, reimbursement or payment for our products. The cost containment measures that health care payers and providers are instituting and the effect of any health care reform could materially harm our ability to operate profitably and access capital.\nIf we or our third-party collaborators are unable to train physicians to use our products and product candidates to treat patients\u2019 diseases or medical conditions, we may not achieve market acceptance of our products\nBroad use of certain of our products, such as POSIMIR, will require extensive training of numerous physicians on their proper and safe use. The time required to train physicians could delay introduction of our products and adversely affect market acceptance of our products. We or third parties selling our products may be unable to rapidly train physicians in numbers sufficient to generate adequate demand for our products. Any delay in training would materially delay the demand for our products and harm our business and financial results. In addition, we or our partners may expend significant funds towards such training before any orders are placed for our products, which would increase our expenses and harm our financial results.\nPotential new accounting pronouncements and legislative actions are likely to impact our future financial position or results of operations\nFuture changes in financial accounting standards may cause adverse, unexpected fluctuations in the timing of the recognition of revenues or expenses and may affect our financial position or results of operations. New pronouncements and varying interpretations of pronouncements have occurred with frequency and may occur in the future and we may make changes in our accounting policies in the future. Compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses. Changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, new SEC regulations, state and local laws and regulations, PCAOB pronouncements and Nasdaq rules, are creating uncertainty for companies such as ours and insurance, accounting and auditing costs are high as a result of this uncertainty and other factors. Compliance with evolving corporate governance and public disclosure standards may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from value-creating activities to compliance activities.\nRisks related to actions on trade by the U.S. and foreign governments could adversely affect the Company's results of operations and financial condition\nThe U.S. government under the previous administration indicated its intent to adopt a new approach to trade policy and in some cases to renegotiate, or potentially terminate, certain existing bilateral or multilateral trade agreements. It also initiated the imposition of tariffs on certain foreign products. Changes in U.S. trade policy have resulted in, and could continue to result in, one or more U.S. trading partners adopting responsive trade policy making it more difficult or costly for us to export our products to those countries. These measures could also result in increased costs for goods imported into the United States. This in turn could require us to increase prices to our customers which may reduce demand, or, if we are unable to increase prices, result in lowering our margin on products sold.\nThere is also a concern that the imposition of additional tariffs by the United States could result in the adoption of additional tariffs by other countries. A potential resulting trade war could have a significant adverse effect on world trade and the world economy. We cannot predict future trade policy or the terms of any renegotiated trade agreements and their impact on our business. The adoption and expansion of trade restrictions, the occurrence of a trade war, or other governmental action related to tariffs or trade agreements or policies has the potential to adversely impact demand for our products, our costs, our customers, our suppliers, and the U.S. economy, which in turn could adversely impact our business, financial condition, access to capital and results of operations.\nRisks Related To Our Common Stock\nOur operating history makes evaluating our stock difficult\nOur quarterly and annual results of operations have historically fluctuated and we expect will continue to fluctuate for the foreseeable future. We believe that period-to-period comparisons of our\noperating results should not be relied upon as predictive of future performance. Our prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties encountered by companies with a limited number of approved pharmaceutical products, particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets such as pharmaceuticals and biotechnology. To address these risks, we must, among other things, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize our product candidates, which may not occur. We may not be successful in addressing these risks and difficulties. We expect to require additional funds to complete the development of larsucosterol or our other product candidates, and to fund operating losses to be incurred in the next several years.\nInvestors may experience substantial dilution of their investment\nIn order to raise capital and for other purposes, we may in the future offer and issue additional shares of our common stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock, and the price per share at which we sell additional shares of our common stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock in future transactions may be higher or lower than the price per share at which investors in our common stock bought their shares. In July 2021, we filed a shelf registration statement (\u201cthe 2021 Registration Statement\u201d) to sell up to $250 million of securities from time to time in one or more public offerings, including up to $75.0 million of shares of common stock through an at the market sales agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald (the \u201c2021 Sales Agreement\u201d). When the 2021 Registration Statement was declared effective in August 2021, the 2021 Sales Agreement replaced a prior similar 2015 Sales Agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald. Any sales in the public market of our common stock, under our 2021 Sales Agreement, in offerings under our shelf registration statement or otherwise, could adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock. Through several financings between 2019 and March 3, 2022, and through our 2015 Sales Agreement and 2018 Sales Agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald during this period, we have raised an aggregate of $79.4 million. As of March 3, 2022, we had up to $250.0 million of our securities available for sale under the 2021 Registration Statement, of which $75.0 million of our common stock are available pursuant to the 2021 Sales Agreement. In addition, as of December 31, 2021, 25,362,025 shares of our common stock were issuable upon exercise of stock options outstanding under our stock option plans at a weighted average exercise price of $1.39 per share, 6,793,921 additional shares of common stock were reserved for potential future issuance under our stock option plan, and an aggregate of 383,412 shares of common stock were reserved for potential future issuance under our 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Investors will incur dilution from the sale of any additional shares or upon the issuance of any shares pursuant to such plans, or upon exercise of any outstanding options.\nOur stock price has in the past and may in the future not meet the minimum bid price for continued listing on Nasdaq. Our ability to continue operations or to publicly or privately sell equity securities and the liquidity of our common stock could be adversely affected if we are delisted from Nasdaq\nIn several instances in the past, including as recently as February 2022, we received written notification from Nasdaq informing us that because the closing bid price of our common stock was below $1.00 for 30 consecutive trading days, our shares no longer complied with the minimum closing bid price requirement for continued listing on Nasdaq under Nasdaq Marketplace Rules. Each time, we were given a period of 180 days from the date of the notification and in one case an extra 180-day period to regain compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s listing requirements by having the closing bid price of our common stock listed on Nasdaq be at least $1.00 for at least 10 consecutive trading days.\nWhile we have regained compliance within the applicable time periods in the past, if our shares again no longer comply with the minimum closing bid price requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market under Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 5550(a)(2) and we do not regain compliance within the applicable 180-day time period, Nasdaq will notify us that our securities will be subject to delisting. One strategy to regain compliance in such circumstances would be to implement a reverse stock split. The Company could appeal Nasdaq\u2019s determination to delist its securities to a Hearings Panel. During any appeal process, shares of our common stock would continue to trade on the Nasdaq Capital Market.\nThere can be no assurance that we will maintain compliance with the requirements for listing our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market. Delisting from Nasdaq would constitute an event of default\nunder our loan facility with Oxford, entitling Oxford to accelerate our obligations under such facility, among other actions. Under such circumstances, we could be required to renegotiate the repayment terms of our loan facility, on terms which would not be as favorable to the Company as our current terms, or we could be required to take other actions, such as discontinuing some or all of our operations, selling assets, or other action. Delisting could also adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital through the public or private sale of equity securities, would significantly affect the ability of investors to trade our securities and would negatively affect the value and liquidity of our common stock. Delisting could also have other negative results, including the potential loss of confidence by employees, the loss of institutional investor interest and fewer business development opportunities.\nOur ability to use net operating losses and certain other tax attributes is uncertain and may be limited\nOur ability to use our federal and state net operating losses to offset potential future taxable income and related income taxes that would otherwise be due is dependent upon our generation of future taxable income before the expiration dates of the net operating losses, and we cannot predict with certainty when, or whether, we will generate sufficient taxable income to use any or all of our net operating losses. In addition, utilization of net operating losses to offset potential future taxable income and related income taxes that would otherwise be due is subject to annual limitations under the \u201cownership change\u201d provisions of Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (Internal Revenue Code) and similar state provisions, which may result in the expiration of net operating losses before future utilization. In general, under the Code, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating losses and other pre-change tax attributes (such as research and development credit carryforwards) to offset its post-change taxable income or taxes may be limited. Our equity offerings and other changes in our stock ownership, some of which are outside of our control, may have resulted or could in the future result in an ownership change. If an ownership change limitation were to apply, utilization of our net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards could be limited in future periods and a portion of the carryforwards could expire before being available to reduce future income tax liabilities.\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile\nThe stock markets in general, and the markets for pharmaceutical stocks in particular, have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nPrice declines in our common stock could result from general market and economic conditions and a variety of other factors, including:\n\u2022\nadverse results (including adverse events or failure to demonstrate safety or efficacy) or delays in our clinical and non-clinical trials of larsucosterol or other product candidates;\n\u2022\nannouncements of FDA non-approval of our product candidates, approvals with narrow indications, commercially limiting labels, clinical holds or delays in the FDA or other foreign regulatory agency review process;\n\u2022\nadverse actions taken by regulatory agencies or law enforcement agencies with respect to our products and product candidates, clinical trials, manufacturing processes, accounting practices or sales and marketing activities, or those of our third-party collaborators;\n\u2022\nannouncements of technological innovations, patents, product approvals, sales performance or new products by our competitors;\n\u2022\nfailure of third-party collaborators to continue development or successful commercialization of the respective products and product candidates they are developing or commercializing;\n\u2022\nfailure by our commercial licensee (Innocoll) to successfully launch POSIMIR within a reasonable time, if at all, manufacture and store adequate supplies, and/or to achieve sales expectations and successfully commercialize POSIMIR;\n\u2022\nregulatory, judicial and patent developments in the United States and foreign countries;\n\u2022\nany lawsuit or arbitration involving us or our products and product candidates including intellectual property infringement or product liability suits;\n\u2022\nannouncements concerning our competitors, or the biotechnology or pharmaceutical industries in general;\n\u2022\ndevelopments concerning our strategic alliances or acquisitions or termination of such alliances;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nchanges in recommendations by securities analysts, misstatements or mischaracterizations in analyst reports or dropping or lack of analyst coverage;\n\u2022\nnegative press coverage or online or social media misinformation about the Company or its partners or their respective products or personnel;\n\u2022\ndeviations in our operating results from the estimates of analysts;\n\u2022\nsales of our common stock by our executive officers or directors or sales of substantial amounts of common stock by us or others;\n\u2022\npotential failure to meet continuing listing standards from The Nasdaq Capital Market;\n\u2022\nloss or disruption of facilities due to natural disasters;\n\u2022\nacceleration of our debt obligations due to a determination by our lender that a material adverse change has occurred;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting principles; or\n\u2022\nloss of any of our key scientific or management personnel.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to factors which are beyond our control. The stock market in general has periodically experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. For example, the outbreak of the COVID-19 coronavirus and its new variants, pronouncements by the Federal Reserve, oil price volatility and other factors have caused broad stock market and industry fluctuations. In addition, the market prices of securities of technology and pharmaceutical companies have also been extremely volatile, and have experienced fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. These broad market fluctuations could result in extreme fluctuations in the price of our common stock, which could cause a decline in the value of our common stock.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company\u2019s securities, litigation has often been brought against that company.
