RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our Company involves a high degree of risk. In addition to the other information included in this Annual Report, you should carefully consider the following risk factors in evaluating an investment in our Company. You should consider these matters in conjunction with the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations, revenue, and future prospects could be negatively impacted. In that event, the market price of our Common Stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nRisk Factors Relating to Our Business\nWe have a history of operating losses, expect additional losses and may not achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe have a history of operating losses and expect to incur additional losses as we commence delivering our new generation product and until we achieve sufficient revenue and resulting margins to offset our operating costs. Our net loss for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $3,336,435 and $833,545, respectively. Our ability to achieve future profitability is dependent on a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. Failure to achieve profitability or sustain profitability, if achieved, may require us to raise additional financing, which could have a material negative impact on the market value of our Common Stock.\nWe may need additional capital to execute our business plan, and raising additional capital, if possible, by issuing additional equity securities may cause dilution to existing stockholders. In addition, raising additional capital by issuing additional debt instruments may restrict our operations.\nAlthough we believe we have adequate financial resources to fund our operating expense for at least the next twelve months, and that we may be able to generate funds from product sales during that time, existing working capital may not be sufficient to achieve profitable operations due to product introduction costs, operating losses and other factors. Principal factors affecting the availability of internally generated funds include:\n\u25cf\nfailure of product sales to meet planned projections;\n\u25cf\nworking capital requirements to support business growth;\n\u25cf\nour ability to control spending; and\n\u25cf\nacceptance of our product in planned markets.\nIn the event we are required to raise additional capital through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage ownership of our stockholders could be diluted significantly, and such newly issued securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of our existing stockholders. In addition, the issuance of any equity securities could be at a discount to the market price.\nIf we incur debt financing, the payment of principal and interest on such indebtedness may limit funds available for our business activities, and we could be subject to covenants that restrict our ability to operate our business and make distributions to our stockholders. These restrictive covenants may include limitations on additional borrowing and specific restrictions on the use of our assets, as well as prohibitions on our ability to create liens, pay dividends, redeem stock or make investments. There is no assurance that any equity or debt financing transaction will be available on acceptable terms, if at all.\nWe are a development stage technology company with minimal revenue and limited experience developing security technology for law enforcement or other security personnel, as well as other areas required for the successful development and commercialization of the BolaWrap 100, our first product, which makes it difficult to assess our future viability.\nWe are a development stage technology company. Although we are commercializing our first product, the BolaWrap 100, we have generated minimal revenue to date, and we have not yet demonstrated an ability to overcome many of the fundamental risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by development stage companies in new and rapidly evolving fields of technology. To execute our business plan successfully, we will need to accomplish the following fundamental objectives, either on our own or with strategic collaborators:\n\u25cf\nsuccessfully commercialize the BolaWrap 100, and develop additional future products for commercialization;\n\u25cf\ndevelop, obtain and maintain required regulatory approvals for commercialization of products we produce;\n\u25cf\nestablish an intellectual property portfolio for the BolaWrap 100 and other future products;\n\u25cf\nestablish and maintain sales, distribution and marketing capabilities, and/or enter into strategic partnering arrangements to access such capabilities;\n\u25cf\ngain market acceptance for the BolaWrap 100 and/or other future products; and\n\u25cf\nobtain adequate capital resources and manage our spending as costs and expenses increase due to research, production, development, regulatory approval and commercialization of the BolaWrap 100 and/or other future products.\nOur principal product remains under development, and has not yet been produced in recurring commercial quantities. We may incur significant and unpredictable warranty costs as our products are introduced and produced.\nOur principal product has been introduced into the marketplace for testing and remains under development as we make improvements based on ongoing customer trials. Although we are producing small numbers of commercial products, no assurance can be provided that we can successfully scale to produce higher volume commercial quantities of our principal product or that additional development will not be required for a commercially viable product. We generally expect to warrant our products to be free from defects in materials and workmanship for a period of up to one year from the date of purchase. We may incur substantial and unpredictable warranty costs from post-production product or component failures. Future warranty costs could further adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and business prospects.\nWe are materially dependent on the acceptance of our product by the law enforcement market. If law enforcement agencies do not purchase our product, our revenue will be adversely affected and we may not be able to expand into other markets, or otherwise continue as a going concern.\nA substantial number of law enforcement agencies may not purchase our remote restraint product. In addition, if our product is not widely accepted by the law enforcement market, we may not be able to expand sales of our product into other markets. Law enforcement agencies may be influenced by claims or perceptions that our product is not effective or may be used in an abusive manner. Sales of our product to these agencies may be delayed or limited by such claims or perceptions.\nWe will be dependent on sales of the BolaWrap 100 for the foreseeable future, and if this product is not widely accepted, our growth prospects will be diminished.\nWe expect to depend on sales of the BolaWrap 100 and related cartridges for the foreseeable future. A lack of demand for this product, or its failure to achieve broad market acceptance, would significantly harm our growth prospects, operating results and financial condition.\nOur international operations could be harmed by factors including political instability, natural disasters, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and changes in regulations that govern international transactions.\nWe expect to sell our products worldwide and have commenced export activities for multiple countries. We expect exports to become a significant part of our future business. The risks inherent in international trade may reduce our international sales and harm our business and the businesses of our customers and our suppliers. These risks include, among other things:\n\u25cf\nchanges in tariff regulations;\n\u25cf\npolitical instability, war, terrorism and other political risks;\n\u25cf\nforeign currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u25cf\nestablishing and maintaining relationships with local distributors, agents and dealers;\n\u25cf\nlengthy shipping times and accounts receivable payment cycles;\n\u25cf\nimport and export control and licensing requirements;\n\u25cf\ncompliance with a variety of U.S. laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, by us or key subcontractors;\n\u25cf\ncompliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations, including unexpected changes in taxation and regulatory requirements;\n\u25cf\ngreater difficulty in safeguarding intellectual property abroad than in the U.S.; and\n\u25cf\ndifficulty in staffing and managing geographically diverse operations.\nThese and other risks may preclude or curtail international sales or increase the relative price of our products compared to those manufactured in other countries, reducing the demand for our products. Failure to comply with U.S. and foreign governmental laws and regulations applicable to international business, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or U.S. export control regulations, could have an adverse impact on our business with the U.S. and foreign governments.\nIf we are unable to manage our projected growth, our growth prospects may be limited and our future profitability may be adversely affected.\nWe intend to expand our sales, marketing and training programs and our manufacturing capability. Rapid expansion may strain our managerial, financial and other resources. If we are unable to manage our growth, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected. Our systems, procedures, controls and management resources also may not be adequate to support our future operations. We will need to continually improve our operational, financial and other internal systems to manage our growth effectively, and any failure to do so may lead to inefficiencies and redundancies, and result in reduced growth prospects and profitability.\nWe may face personal injury and other liability claims that harm our reputation and adversely affect our sales and financial condition.\nOur product is intended to be used in confrontations that could result in injury to those involved, whether or not involving our product. Our product may cause or be associated with such injuries. A person injured in a confrontation or otherwise in connection with the use of our product may bring legal action against us to recover damages on the basis of theories including personal injury, wrongful death, negligent design, dangerous product or inadequate warning. We may also be subject to lawsuits involving allegations of misuse of our product. If successful, personal injury, misuse and other claims could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Although we carry product liability insurance, significant litigation could also result in a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, negative publicity and an award of monetary damages in excess of our insurance coverage.\nOur future success is dependent on our ability to expand sales through direct sales or distributors, and our inability to grow our sales force or recruit new distributors would negatively affect our sales.\nOur distribution strategy is to pursue sales through multiple channels with an emphasis on direct sales and, in the future, independent distributors. Our inability to recruit and retain sales personnel and police equipment distributors who can successfully sell our products could adversely affect our sales. If we do not competitively price our products, meet the requirements of any future distributors or end-users, provide adequate marketing support, or comply with the terms of any distribution arrangements, such distributors may fail to aggressively market our product or may terminate their relationships with us. These developments would likely have a material adverse effect on our sales. Should we employ distributors, our reliance on the sales of our products by others would also make it more difficult to predict our revenue, cash flow and operating results.\nWe expect to expend significant resources to generate sales due to our lengthy sales cycle, and such efforts may not result in sales or revenue.\nGenerally, law enforcement agencies consider a wide range of issues before committing to purchase a product, including product benefits, training costs, the cost to use our product in addition to, or in place of, other use of force products, product reliability and budget constraints. The length of our sales cycle may range from 30 days to a year or more. We may incur substantial selling costs and expend significant effort in connection with the evaluation of our product by potential customers before they place an order, if they place an order at all. If these potential customers do not purchase our product, we will have expended significant resources without corresponding revenue.\nMost of our intended end-users are subject to budgetary and political constraints that may delay or prevent sales.\nMost of our intended end-user customers are government agencies. These agencies often do not set their own budgets and therefore have little control over the amount of money they can spend. In addition, these agencies experience political pressure that may dictate the manner in which they spend money. As a result, even if an agency wants to acquire our product, it may be unable to purchase our product due to budgetary or political constraints. Some government agency orders may also be canceled or substantially delayed due to budgetary, political or other scheduling delays, which frequently occur in connection with the acquisition of products by such agencies.\nGovernment regulation of our products may adversely affect sales.\nOur device is classified as a firearm regulated by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms involving substantial regulatory compliance. Our device may also face state restrictions, especially regarding sales to security agencies. Our product sales may be significantly affected by federal, state and local regulation. Failure to comply with regulations could also result in the imposition of fines, penalties and other actions that could adversely impact our financial position, cash flows and operating results.\nOur product is also controlled by the United States Department of Commerce (\u201cDOC\u201d) for exports directly from the United States. Consequently, we need to obtain export licenses from the DOC for the export of our products from the United States. Compliance with or changes in U.S. export regulations could significantly and adversely affect any future international sales.\nCertain foreign jurisdictions may restrict the importation or sale of our products, limiting our international sales opportunities.\nOur products, including the BolaWrap 100, have limited issued patents or other intellectual property protection. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, we may lose a competitive advantage or incur substantial litigation costs to protect our rights.\nOur future success depends in part upon our proprietary technology. We currently own four issued U.S. patents related to the BolaWrap 100 and have six U.S. patents pending. We have filed foreign patent applications in the European Union (17 countries) and 17 other countries, and reserved our rights to file additional foreign patents. Our protective measures taken thus far, including our issued patents, pending patents, trademarks and trade secret laws, may prove inadequate to protect our proprietary rights. There can be no assurance we will be granted any patent rights from pending patents. The scope of any possible patent rights may not prevent others from developing and selling competing products. The validity and breadth of claims covered in any possible patents involve complex legal and factual questions, and the resolution of such claims may be highly uncertain, lengthy, and expensive. In addition, any patents, if granted, may be held invalid upon challenge, or others may claim rights in or ownership of our patents.\nOur competitive position will be seriously damaged if our products are found to infringe on the intellectual property rights of others.\nOther companies and our competitors may currently own or obtain patents or other proprietary rights that might prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to make, use or sell our products. Any intellectual property infringement claims made against us, with or without merit, could be costly and time-consuming to defend and divert our management\u2019s attention from our business. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us and our failure or inability to license the infringed technology, our business and operating results could be adversely affected. Any litigation or claims, whether or not valid, could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources. An adverse result from intellectual property litigation could force us to do one or more of the following:\n\u25cf\ncease selling, incorporating or using products or services that incorporate the challenged intellectual property;\n\u25cf\nobtain a license from the holder of the infringed intellectual property right, which license may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all; and\n\u25cf\nredesign products or services that incorporate the disputed technology.\nIf we are forced to take any of the foregoing actions, we could face substantial costs and shipment delays and our business could be seriously harmed. Although we carry general liability insurance, our insurance may not cover potential claims of this type or be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed.\nIn addition, it is possible that our customers may seek indemnity from us in the event that our products are found or alleged to infringe the intellectual property rights of others. Any such claim for indemnity could result in substantial expense to us that could harm our operating results.\nWe have no experience developing law enforcement products. Our lack of experience and competition in the law enforcement market could reduce our sales and prevent us from achieving profitability.\nThe law enforcement market is highly competitive and our management team has no experience developing law enforcement products. We face competition from numerous larger, better capitalized, more experienced and more widely known companies that make restraint devices, less-lethal weapons and other law enforcement products. Increased competition could result in greater pricing pressure, lower gross margins and reduced sales, and prevent us from achieving profitability.\nWe cannot predict our future operating results. Our quarterly and annual results will likely be subject to fluctuations caused by many factors, any of which could result in our failure to achieve our expectations.\nWe currently expect that the BolaWrap 100 will be the sole source of our revenue in the foreseeable future. We expect our revenue, if any, to vary significantly due to a number of factors. Many of these factors are beyond our control. Any one or more of these factors, including those listed below, could cause us to fail to achieve our revenue expectations. These factors include, among others:\n\u25cf\nour ability to develop and supply product to customers;\n\u25cf\nmarket acceptance of, and changes in demand for, our products;\n\u25cf\ngains or losses of significant customers, distributors or strategic relationships;\n\u25cf\nunpredictable volume and timing of customer orders;\n\u25cf\nthe availability, pricing and timeliness of delivery of components for our products;\n\u25cf\nfluctuations in the availability of manufacturing capacity or manufacturing yields and related manufacturing costs;\n\u25cf\ntiming of new technological advances, product announcements or introductions by us and by our competitors;\n\u25cf\nunpredictable warranty costs associated with our products;\n\u25cf\nbudgetary cycles and order delays by customers or production delays by us or our suppliers;\n\u25cf\nregulatory changes affecting the marketability of our products;\n\u25cf\ngeneral economic conditions that could affect the timing of customer orders and capital spending and result in order cancellations or rescheduling; and\n\u25cf\ngeneral political conditions in this country and in various other parts of the world that could affect spending for the products that we intend to offer.\nSome or all of these factors could adversely affect demand for our products and, therefore, adversely affect our future operating results. As a result of these and other factors, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful in the near term, and accordingly you should not rely upon our performance in a particular period as indicative of our performance in any future period.\nOur expense may vary from period to period, which could affect quarterly results and our stock price.\nIf we incur additional expense in a quarter in which we do not experience increased revenue, our results of operations will be adversely affected and we may incur larger losses than anticipated for that quarter. Factors that could cause our expense to fluctuate from period to period include:\n\u25cf\nthe timing and extent of our research and development efforts;\n\u25cf\ninvestments and costs of maintaining or protecting our intellectual property;\n\u25cf\nthe extent of marketing and sales efforts to promote our products and technologies; and\n\u25cf\nthe timing of personnel and consultant hiring.\nOur dependence on third-party suppliers for key components of our product could delay shipment of our products and reduce our sales.\nWe depend on certain domestic and foreign suppliers for the delivery of components used in the assembly of our product. Our reliance on third-party suppliers creates risks related to our potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of components or sub-assemblies and reduced control over pricing and timing of delivery of components and subassemblies. Specifically, we will depend on suppliers of sub-assemblies, machined parts, injection molded plastic parts, and other miscellaneous custom parts for our product. We do not have any long-term supply agreements with any planned suppliers. Any interruption of supply for any material components of our products could significantly delay the shipment of our products and have a material adverse effect on our revenue, profitability and financial condition.\nForeign currency fluctuations may reduce our competitiveness and sales in foreign markets.\nThe relative change in currency values creates fluctuations in product pricing for future potential international customers. These changes in foreign end-user costs may result in lost orders and reduce the competitiveness of our products in certain foreign markets. These changes may also negatively affect the financial condition of some foreign customers and reduce or eliminate their future orders of our products.\nLoss of key management and other personnel could impact our business.\nOur business is substantially dependent on our officers and other key personnel. The loss of an officer or any key personnel could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, competition for skilled and non-skilled employees among companies like ours is intense, and the future loss of skilled or non-skilled employees or an inability to attract, retain and motivate additional skilled and non-skilled employees required for the operation and expansion of our business could hinder our ability to conduct research activities successfully, develop new products, attract customers and meet customer shipments.\nInadequate internal controls and accounting practices could lead to errors, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe will need to improve internal controls and management oversight systems. Our small size and limited personnel and consulting resources make doing so more challenging than for more established entities. We may not be able to prevent or detect misstatements in our reported financial statements due to limited segregation of duties, system errors, the potential for human error, unauthorized actions of employees or contractors, inadequacy of controls, temporary lapses in controls due to shortfalls in transition planning and oversight resource contracts and other factors. In addition, due to their inherent limitations, such controls may not prevent or detect misstatements in our reported financial results as required under SEC rules, which could increase our operating costs or impair our ability to operate our business. Controls may also become inadequate due to changes in circumstances. It will be necessary to replace, upgrade or modify our internal information systems from time to time. If we are unable to implement these changes in a timely and cost-effective manner, our ability to capture and process financial transactions and support our customers as required may be materially adversely impacted, which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisk Factors Relating to Our Common Stock\nOur stock price may be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance, resulting in substantial losses for investors.\nOur Common Stock was quoted on the OTCQB Venture Market commencing in late May 2018 and uplisted to the Nasdaq Capital Market in December 2018. The market price of our Common Stock may be highly volatile and may fluctuate substantially as a result of a variety of factors, some of which are related in complex ways. Since shares of our Common Stock were sold in our initial public offering, (\u201cIPO\u201d), in December 2017 at a price of $1.50 per share, our stock price has ranged from a low of $2.10 to a high of $9.00 through March 6, 2019.\nThe market price of our Common Stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the factors listed below and other factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section:\n\u25cf\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u25cf\nfailure of securities analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of our Company, changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our Company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\n\u25cf\nratings changes by any securities analysts who follow our Company;\n\u25cf\nchanges in the availability of federal funding to support local law enforcement efforts, or local budgets;\n\u25cf\nannouncements by us of significant technical innovations, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u25cf\nchanges in operating performance and stock market valuations of other security product companies generally;\n\u25cf\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market, including as a result of trends in the economy as a whole;\n\u25cf\nchanges in our board of directors or management;\n\u25cf\nsales of large blocks of our Common Stock, including sales by our executive officers, directors and significant stockholders;\n\u25cf\nlawsuits threatened or filed against us;\n\u25cf\nshort sales, hedging and other derivative transactions involving our capital stock;\n\u25cf\ngeneral economic conditions in the United States and abroad; and\n\u25cf\nother events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism or responses to these events.\nIn addition, stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many security and technology companies. Stock prices of many security and technology companies have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. In the past, stockholders have instituted securities action litigation against certain companies following periods of market volatility. If we were to become involved in securities litigation, it could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business and adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our Common Stock may adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock.\nSales or distributions of a substantial number of shares of our Common Stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock. Many of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock, other than the shares held by executive officers and directors, are eligible for immediate resale in the public market. Substantial selling of our Common Stock could adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock.\nOur officers and directors are among our largest stockholders, and may have certain personal interests that may affect the Company.\nManagement owned approximately 61% of our Common Stock at March 6, 2019. As a result, our management, acting individually or as a group, has the potential ability to exert influence on the outcome of issues requiring approval by our stockholders. This concentration of ownership may have effects such as delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company that may be favored by other stockholders or preventing transactions in which stockholders might otherwise recover a premium for their shares over current market prices.\nWe may issue additional shares of Common Stock in the future. The issuance of additional shares of Common Stock may reduce the value of your Common Stock.\nWe may issue additional shares of Common Stock without further action by our stockholders. Moreover, the economic and voting interests of each stockholder will be diluted as a result of any such issuances. Although the number of shares of Common Stock that stockholders presently own will not decrease, such shares will represent a smaller percentage of the total shares that will be outstanding after the issuance of additional shares. The issuance of additional shares of Common Stock may cause the market price of our Common Stock to decline.\nSales of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of any future options or warrants may lower the price of our Common Stock.\nDuring 2018, we granted options to purchase 2,067,500 shares of our Common Stock. In October 2018, we issued warrants to purchase 5,017,181 shares of our Common Stock to certain accredited investors and placement agents in connection with a private placement. The issuance of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of options or warrants could cause substantial dilution to existing holders of our Common Stock, and the sale of those shares in the market could cause the market price of our Common Stock to decline. The potential dilution from the issuance of these shares could negatively affect the terms on which we are able to obtain equity financing.\nWe may issue preferred stock in the future, and the terms of the preferred stock may reduce the value of your Common Stock.\nWe are authorized to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series. Our Board of Directors may determine the terms of future preferred stock offerings without further action by our stockholders. If we issue preferred stock, it could affect your rights or reduce the value of your Common Stock. In particular, specific rights granted to future holders of preferred stock could be used to restrict our ability to merge with or sell our assets to a third party. Preferred stock terms may include voting rights, preferences as to dividends and liquidation, conversion and redemption rights and sinking fund provisions.\nWe incur substantial costs as a result of being a public company.\nAs a public company, we are incurring significant levels of legal, accounting, insurance and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d), the Dodd-Frank Act, the listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Compliance with these rules and regulations increases our legal and financial compliance costs, makes some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and increases demand on our systems and resources as compared to when we operated as a private company. The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and operating results. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. In order to maintain and, if required, improve our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting to meet this standard, significant resources and management oversight may be required. As a result, management\u2019s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. We may need to hire more corporate employees in the future or engage outside consultants to comply with these requirements, which would increase our costs and expenses.\nIn addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time-consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to their application and practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be adversely affected.\nAs a result of disclosure of information in this report and in the filings that we are required to make as a public company, our business, operating results and financial condition have become more visible, which has resulted in, and may in the future result in threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors and other third parties. If any such claims are successful, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected, and even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to resolve them, could divert the resources of our management and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe payment of dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors.\nWe have never declared dividends on our Common Stock, and currently do not anticipate that we will do so in the foreseeable future. The declaration and amount of future dividends, if any, will be determined by our Board of Directors and will depend on our financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, financial covenants, regulatory constraints, industry practice and other factors our Board of Directors deems relevant.", "PERMNO": 18322, "SIC": 3690, "TIC": "WRTC"}
