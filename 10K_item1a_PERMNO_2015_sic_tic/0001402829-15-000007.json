{"cik": "1402829", "company": "Orion Marine Group Inc", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nRisk Factors Relating to Our Business\nWe depend on continued federal, state and local government funding for marine infrastructure. A reduction in government funding for marine construction or maintenance contracts can materially affect our financial results.\nA substantial portion of our operations depend on project funding by various government agencies and are adversely affected by reduced levels of, or delays in, government funding. Decreases or delays in government funding often delay project lettings and result in intense competition and pricing pressures for projects on which we bid. As a result of competitive bidding and pricing pressures, we may either be awarded fewer projects, or realize lower profit margins on contracts awarded to us, which in either case could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nA significant portion of our business is awarded through government contracts. Our operating results may be adversely affected by the terms of the government contracts or our failure to comply with applicable terms.\nGovernment contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations, contract provisions and a variety of regulatory requirements relating to their formation, administration, performance and accounting. Many of these contracts include express or implied certifications of compliance with applicable laws and contract provisions. As a result of our government contracting and subcontracting, claims for civil or criminal fraud may be brought by the government for violations of these regulations, requirements or statutes. We may also be subject to qui tam litigation brought by private individuals on behalf of the government under the Federal Civil False Claims Act, which could include claims for up to treble damages. Further, if we fail to comply with any of these regulations, requirements or statutes, our existing government contracts could be terminated, or we could be suspended or debarred from future government contracting or subcontracting, including federally funded projects at the state level. In addition, government customers typically can terminate or modify any of their contracts with us at their convenience, and certain government agencies may claim immunity from suit to recover disputed contract amounts. If our government contracts are terminated for any reason, or if we are suspended or debarred from government work, we could suffer a significant reduction in expected revenue which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe timing of new contracts may result in volatility in our cash flow and profitability. These factors as well as others that may cause our actual financial results to vary from any publicly disclosed earnings guidance and forecasts are outside of our control.\nOur revenues are generated from project-based work. It is generally very difficult to predict the timing and source of awarded contracts. The selection of, timing of or failure to obtain projects, delays in awards of projects, the rebidding or termination of projects due to budget overruns, cancellations of projects or delays in completion of contracts could result in the under-utilization of our assets and reduce our cash flows. Even if we are awarded contracts, we face additional risks that could affect whether, or when, work will begin. For example, some of our contracts are subject to financing and other contingencies that may delay or result in termination of projects. This may make it difficult to match workforce size and equipment location with contract needs. In some cases, we may be required to bear the cost of a ready workforce and equipment that is larger than needed at the time, resulting in unpredictability in our cash flow, expenses and profitability. If an expected contract award or the related notice to proceed is delayed or not received, we could incur substantial costs without receipt of any corresponding revenues. Delays by our\ncustomers in obtaining required approvals for their infrastructure projects may delay their awarding contracts for those projects and, once awarded, the ability to commence construction under those contracts. Moreover, construction projects for which our services are contracted may require significant expenditures by us prior to receipt of relevant payments by a customer and may expose us to potential credit risk if such customer should encounter financial difficulties. Such expenditures could reduce our cash flows and necessitate increased borrowings under our credit facilities. Finally, the winding down or completion of work on significant projects that were active in previous periods will reduce our revenue and earnings if such significant projects have not been replaced in the current period. From time-to-time we may publicly provide earnings or other forms of guidance, which reflect our predictions about future revenue, operating costs and capital structure, among other factors. Any such predictions may be impacted by these factors as well as others that are beyond our control and might not turn out to be correct.\nWe may be unable to obtain sufficient bonding capacity for our contracts and the need for performance and surety bonds may adversely affect our business.\nWe are generally required to post bonds in connection with government and certain private sector contracts to ensure job completion. We have entered into a bonding agreement with Liberty Mutual Surety of America (\u201cLiberty\u201d) pursuant to which Liberty acts as surety, issues bid bonds, performance bonds and payment bonds, and obligates itself upon other contracts of guaranty required by us in the day-to-day operations of our business. However, Liberty is not obligated under the bonding agreement to issue bonds for us and bonding decisions are made on a case-by-case basis. We may not be able to maintain a sufficient level of bonding capacity in the future, which could preclude us from being able to bid for certain contracts and successfully contract with certain customers, or cause us to have to increase our letter of credit utilization in lieu of bonds, thereby reducing availability under our credit facility. In addition, the conditions of the bonding market may change, increasing our costs of bonding or restricting our ability to get new bonding which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur business depends on good customer relationships and our reputation in the heavy civil marine infrastructure market, which is developed and maintained by our executives and key project managers. Loss of any of our relationships, reputation or executives or key project managers could materially reduce our revenues and profits.\nOur contracts are typically entered into on a project-by-project basis, so we generally do not have continuing contractual commitments with our customers beyond the terms of the current contract. We benefit from key customer relationships built over time and with both public and private entities. We also benefit from our reputation in the heavy civil marine infrastructure market developed over years of successfully performing on projects. Both of these aspects of our business were developed and are maintained through our executives and key project managers. We do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our employees. Our inability to retain our executives and key project managers could have a material adverse effect on our current customer relationships and reputation. The inability to maintain relationships with our customers in general or obtain new customers based on our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe loss of, or a significant reduction in business from a few customers could have an adverse impact on us.\nA few customers have in the past, and may in the future, account for a significant portion of our revenue and/or backlog in any one year or over a period of consecutive years, depending on the size, scope and mix of projects at the time. Although we have long-standing relationships with many of our customers, many of our contracts allow for the unilateral reduction, delay or cancellation of work at any time, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may not be able to fully realize the revenue value reported in our backlog.\nWe had a backlog of work to be completed on contracts totaling approximately $215.9 million as of December 31, 2014. Backlog develops as a result of new awards, which represent the potential revenue value realizable pursuant to new project commitments received by us during a given period. Backlog consists of projects under contract which have either (a) not yet been started or (b) are in progress but are not yet complete. In the latter case, the revenue value reported in backlog is the remaining value related to work that has not yet been completed. We cannot guarantee that the revenue projected in our backlog will be realized, or if realized, will result in earnings. From time-to-time, projects are cancelled that appeared to have a high certainty of going forward at the time they were recorded as new awards. In the event of a project cancellation, we may be reimbursed for certain costs but typically have no contractual right to recover the total revenue reflected in our backlog. In addition to being unable to recover certain direct costs, cancelled projects may also result in additional unrecoverable costs due to the resulting under-utilization of our assets.\nWe could suffer contract losses if we fail to accurately estimate our costs or fail to execute within our cost estimates on fixed-price, lump-sum contracts.\nMuch of our revenue is derived from fixed-price, lump-sum contracts. Under these contracts, we perform our services and execute our projects at a fixed price and where, as a result, we could benefit from cost savings, but we may be unable to recover any cost overruns. Fixed-price contracts carry inherent risks, including risks of losses from underestimating costs, operational difficulties and other factors that may occur over the contract period. If our cost estimates for a contract are inaccurate, or if we do not execute the contract within our cost estimates, we may incur losses or the project may not be as profitable as we expected. In addition, we are sometimes required to incur costs in connection with modifications to a contract (change orders) that may not be approved by the customer as to scope and/or price, or to incur unanticipated costs, including costs for customer-caused delays, errors in specifications or designs, or contract suspension or termination, that we may not be able to recover. These, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. The revenue, cost and gross profit realized on such contracts can vary, sometimes substantially, from the original projections due to changes in a variety of factors, such as:\n\u2022\nfailure to properly estimate costs of engineering, design, material, equipment or labor;\n\u2022\nunanticipated technical problems with the structures or services being supplied by us, which may require that we spend our own money to remedy the problem;\n\u2022\nproject modifications creating unanticipated costs;\n\u2022\nchanges in the costs of equipment, materials, labor or subcontractors;\n\u2022\nour suppliers\u2019 or subcontractors\u2019 failure to perform;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in our customers obtaining required governmental permits or approvals;\n\u2022\nchanges in local laws and regulations;\n\u2022\ndelays caused by local weather conditions; and\n\u2022\nexacerbation of any one or more of these factors as projects grow in size and complexity.\nThese risks increase if the project is of a long-term duration because of the elevated risk that the circumstances upon which we based our original bid will change in a manner that increases costs. In addition, we sometimes bear the risk of delays caused by unexpected conditions or events.\nOur dependence on petroleum-based products increases our costs as the prices of such products increase, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe use diesel fuel and other petroleum-based products to operate our equipment used in our construction contracts. Fluctuations in supplies relative to demand and other factors can cause unanticipated increases in their cost. Future increases in the costs of fuel and other petroleum-based products used in our business, particularly if a bid has been submitted for a contract and the costs of those products have been estimated at amounts less than the actual costs thereof, could result in a lower profit, or even a loss, on one or more contracts.\nMany of our contracts have penalties for late completion.\nIn many instances, including in our fixed-price contracts, we guarantee that we will complete a project by a scheduled date. If we subsequently fail to complete the project as scheduled, we may be liable for any customer losses resulting from such delay, generally in the form of contractually agreed-upon liquidated damages. In addition, failure to maintain a required schedule could cause us to default on our government contracts, giving rise to a variety of potential damages. To the extent that these events occur, the total costs of the project could exceed our original estimates, and we could experience reduced profits or, in some cases, a loss for that project.\nWe may choose, or be required, to pay our suppliers and subcontractors even if our customers do not pay, or delay paying, us for the related services.\nWe use suppliers to obtain necessary materials and, from time to time, subcontractors to perform portions of our services and to manage work flow. In some cases, we pay our suppliers and subcontractors before our customers pay us for the related services. If we choose, or are required, to pay our suppliers and subcontractors for materials purchased and work performed for customers who fail to pay, or delay paying, us for the related work, we could experience a material adverse effect on our liquidity, operating results and financial condition.\nWe extend credit to customers for purchases of our services, and in the past we have had, and in the future we may have, difficulty collecting receivables from major customers that have filed bankruptcy or are otherwise experiencing financial difficulties.\nWe generally perform services in advance of payment for our customers, which include governmental entities, general contractors, and builders, owners and managers of marine and port facilities. Consequently, we are subject to potential credit risk related to changes in business and economic factors. On occasion, we have had difficulty collecting from governmental entities or customers with financial difficulties. If we cannot collect receivables for present or future services, we could experience reduced cash flows and losses beyond our established reserves.\nWe may incur higher costs to acquire, manufacture and maintain equipment necessary for our operations.\nWe have traditionally owned most of the equipment used in our projects, and we do not bid on contracts for which we do not have, or cannot quickly procure, whether through construction, acquisition or lease, the necessary equipment to complete projects. We are capable of building much of the specialized equipment used in our projects, including dayboats, tenders and dredges. To the extent that we are unable to buy or build equipment necessary for our needs, either due to a lack of available funding or equipment shortages in the marketplace, we may be forced to rent equipment on a short-term basis, which could increase the costs of completing contracts, thereby reducing contract profitability. In addition, our equipment requires continuous maintenance, which we provide through our own repair facilities, as well as certification by the U.S. Coast Guard. If we are unable to continue to maintain the equipment in our fleet or are unable to obtain the requisite certifications, we may be forced to obtain third-party repair services, be unable to use our uncertified equipment or be unable to bid on contracts, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIn addition, our vessels may be subject to arrest or seizure by claimants as security for maritime torts committed by the vessel or us or the failure by us to pay for necessaries, including fuel and repair services, which were furnished to the vessel. Such arrest or seizure could preclude the vessel from working, thereby causing delays in marine construction projects.\nTo be successful, we need to attract and retain qualified personnel, and any inability to do so could adversely affect our business.\nOur future success depends on our ability to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled personnel in various areas, including engineering, project management, procurement, project controls, finance, and senior management. If we do not succeed in retaining and motivating our current employees and attracting new high quality employees, our business could be adversely affected. Accordingly, our ability to increase our productivity and profitability will be dependent upon our ability to employ, train and retain skilled personnel adequate to meet our requirements. We may not be able to maintain an adequate skilled labor force necessary to operate efficiently. Our labor expenses may also increase as a result of a shortage in the supply of skilled personnel, or we may have to curtail our planned internal growth as a result of labor shortages. We may also spend considerable resources training employees who may then be hired by our competitors, forcing us to spend additional funds to attract personnel to fill those positions. In addition, certain of our employees hold licenses and permits under which we operate. The loss of any such employees could result in our inability to operate under such licenses and permits, which could adversely affect our operations until replacement licenses or permits are obtained. If we are unable to hire and retain qualified personnel in the future, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe may be subject to unionization, work stoppages, slowdowns or increased labor costs.\nOnly a small percentage of our workforce, located in the Pacific Northwest, is unionized. If a majority of our employees unionized, it could limit the flexibility of our workforce and could result in demands that might increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our profitability. Each of our different employee groups could unionize at any time and would require separate collective bargaining agreements. If any group of our employees were to unionize and we were unable to agree on the terms of their collective bargaining agreement or we were to experience widespread employee dissatisfaction, we could be subject to work slowdowns or stoppages. In addition, we may be subject to disruptions by organized labor groups protesting our non-union status. Any of these events would be disruptive to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nConstruction worksites are inherently dangerous workplaces. If we fail to maintain safe worksites, we may be subject to significant operating risks and hazards that could result in injury or death to persons, which could result in losses or liabilities to us.\nOur safety record is an important consideration for us and for our customers. If serious accidents or fatalities occur or our safety record was to deteriorate, we may be ineligible to bid on certain work, and existing service arrangements could be terminated.\nFurther, regulatory changes implemented by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\"OSHA\") or the U.S. Coast Guard could impose additional costs on us. Adverse experience with hazards and claims could have a negative effect on our reputation with our existing or potential new customers and our prospects for future work.\nOur business is subject to significant operating risks and hazards that could result in damage or destruction to property, which could result in losses or liabilities to us.\nThe businesses of marine infrastructure construction, port maintenance, dredging and salvage are generally subject to a number of risks and hazards, including environmental hazards, industrial accidents, hurricanes, adverse weather conditions, collisions with fixed objects, cave-ins, encountering unusual or unexpected geological formations, disruption of transportation services and flooding. These risks could result in damage to or destruction of, dredges, transportation vessels, other maritime structures and buildings, and could also result in personal injury or death, environmental damage, performance delays, monetary losses or legal liability.\nOur current insurance coverage may not be adequate, and we may not be able to obtain insurance at acceptable rates, or at all.\nWe maintain various insurance policies, including general liability and workers\u2019 compensation. We are partially self-insured under some of our policies, and our insurance does not cover all types or amounts of liabilities. We are not required to, and do not, specifically set aside funds for our self-insurance programs.\nAt any given time, we are subject to multiple workers\u2019 compensation and personal injury claims. We maintain substantial loss accruals for workers\u2019 compensation claims, and, until recently, our workers\u2019 compensation and insurance costs have been rising for several years notwithstanding our emphasis on safety. Our insurance policies may not be adequate to protect us from liabilities that we incur in our business. In addition, some of the projects that we bid on require us to maintain builder\u2019s risk insurance at high levels. We may not be able to obtain similar levels of insurance on reasonable terms, or at all. Our inability to obtain such insurance coverage at acceptable rates or at all could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nFurthermore, due to a variety of factors such as increases in claims and projected significant increases in medical costs and wages, our insurance premiums may increase in the future and we may not be able to obtain similar levels of insurance on reasonable terms, or at all. Any such inadequacy of, or inability to obtain, insurance coverage at acceptable rates, or at all, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur employees are covered by federal laws that provide seagoing employees remedies for job-related claims in addition to those provided by state laws.\nMany of our employees are covered by federal maritime law, including provisions of the Jones Act, the Longshore and Harbor Workers Act, (\u201cUSL&H\u201d) and the Seaman\u2019s Wage Act. Jones Act laws typically operate to make liability limits established by USL&H and state workers\u2019 compensation laws inapplicable to these employees and to permit these employees and their representatives to pursue litigation against employers for job-related injuries. Because in some cases we are not protected by the limits imposed by state workers\u2019 compensation statutes, we have greater exposure for claims made by these employees as compared to employers whose employees are not covered by these provisions.\nFor example, in the normal course of business, we are a defendant in various personal injury lawsuits. We maintain insurance to cover claims that arise from injuries to our workforce subject to a deductible. During 2014, we recorded approximately $2.4 million of expense for our self-insured portion of these liabilities. We believe our recorded self insurance reserves represent our best estimate of the outcomes of these claims. Should negative trends persist; we could continue to be negatively impacted in the future.\nDuring the ordinary course of our business, we may become subject to lawsuits or indemnity claims, which could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe have been and may from time to time be named as a defendant in legal actions claiming damages in connection with marine infrastructure projects and other matters. Typically, these claims that arise in the normal course of business, including employment-related claims and contractual disputes or claims for personal injury (including asbestos-related lawsuits) or property damage which occurs in connection with services performed relating to project or construction sites. These actions may seek, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, workers\u2019 compensation, employment discrimination, breach of contract, property damage, environmental damage, punitive damages, civil penalties or other losses, consequential damages or injunctive or\ndeclaratory relief. Contractual disputes normally involve claims relating to the timely completion of projects, performance of equipment, design or other engineering services or project services. We may incur liabilities that may not be covered by insurance policies, or, if covered, the dollar amount of such liabilities may exceed our policy limits or fall below applicable deductibles. A partially or completely uninsured claim, if successful and of significant magnitude, could cause us to suffer a significant loss and reduce cash available for our operations.\nFurthermore, our services are integral to the operation and performance of the marine infrastructure. As a result, we may become subject to lawsuits or claims for any failure of the infrastructure that we work on, even if our services are not the cause of such failures. In addition, we may incur civil and criminal liabilities to the extent that our services contributed to any property damage or personal injury. With respect to such lawsuits, claims, proceedings and indemnities, we have and will accrue reserves in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In the event that such actions or indemnities are ultimately resolved unfavorably at amounts exceeding our accrued reserves, or at material amounts, the outcome could materially and adversely affect our reputation, business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, payments of significant amounts, even if reserved, could adversely affect our liquidity position.\nOur operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations that may expose us to significant costs and liabilities.\nOur marine infrastructure construction, salvage, demolition, dredging and dredge material disposal activities are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those concerning air emissions, water quality, solid waste management, and protection of certain marine and bird species, their habitats, and wetlands. We may incur substantial costs in order to conduct our operations in compliance with these laws and regulations. For instance, we may be required to obtain, maintain and comply with permits and other approvals (as well as those obtained for projects by our customers) issued by various federal, state and local governmental authorities; limit or prevent releases of materials from our operations in accordance with these permits and approvals; and install pollution control equipment. In addition, compliance with environmental laws and regulations can delay or prevent our performance of a particular project and increase related project costs. Moreover, new, stricter environmental laws, regulations or enforcement policies, including those imposed in response to climate change, could be implemented that significantly increase our compliance costs, or require us to adopt more costly methods of operation.\nFailure to comply with environmental laws and regulations, or the permits issued under them, may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial obligations and the issuance of injunctions limiting or preventing some or all of our operations. In addition, strict joint and several liability may be imposed under certain environmental laws, which could cause us to become liable for the investigation or remediation of environmental contamination that resulted from the conduct of others or from our own actions that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time those actions were taken. Further, it is possible that we may be exposed to liability due to releases of pollutants, or other environmental impacts that may arise in the course of our operations. For instance, some of the work we perform is in underground and water environments, and if the field location maps or waterway charts supplied to us are not accurate, or if objects are present in the soil or water that are not indicated on the field location maps or waterway charts, our underground and underwater work could strike objects in the soil or the waterway bottom containing pollutants and result in a rupture and discharge of pollutants. In addition, we sometimes perform directional drilling operations below certain environmentally sensitive terrains and water bodies, and due to the inconsistent nature of the terrain and water bodies, it is possible that such directional drilling may cause a surface fracture releasing subsurface materials. These releases may contain contaminants in excess of amounts permitted by law, may expose us to remediation costs and fines and legal actions by private parties seeking damages for non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property damage. We may not be able to recover some or any of these costs through insurance or increased revenues, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. See \u201cBusiness - Environmental Matters\u201d for more information.\nWe may be affected by market or regulatory responses to climate change.\nClimate change legislation or regulation may result in the imposition of additional environmental regulations, concerning, among other factors, greenhouse gas emissions. Enactment of such additional regulations could result in increased compliance costs for us and our customers. We may not be able to pass such additional costs on to our customers.\nWe may be unable to sustain historical revenue growth rates.\nWe may be unable to sustain the revenue growth rates we experienced in the past, due to limits on additional growth in our current markets, less success in competitive bidding for contracts, limitations on access to necessary working capital and investment capital to sustain growth, limitations on access to bonding to support increased contracts and operations, the inability to hire and retain essential personnel and to acquire equipment to support growth, and the inability to identify acquisition candidates and successfully integrate them into our business. A sustained decrease in revenue growth could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, operating results and financial condition if we are unable to reduce the growth of our operating expenses at the same rate.\nThe anticipated investment in port and marine infrastructure may not be as large as expected, which may result in periods of low demand for our services.\nThe demand for port construction, maintenance infrastructure services and dredging may be vulnerable to downturns in the economy generally and in the marine transportation industry specifically. The amount of capital expenditures on port facilities and marine infrastructure in our markets is affected by the actual and anticipated shipping and vessel needs of the economy in general and in our geographic markets in particular. If the general level of economic activity deteriorates, our customers may delay or cancel expansions, upgrades, maintenance and repairs to their infrastructure. A number of other factors, including the financial condition of the shipping industry, could adversely affect our customers and their ability or willingness to fund capital expenditures in the future. During downturns in the U.S. or world economies, the anticipated port usage in our geographic markets may decline, resulting in less port construction, upgrading and maintenance. As a result, demand for our services could substantially decline for extended periods.\nTerrorist attacks at port facilities could negatively impact the markets in which we operate.\nTerrorist attacks, targeted at ports, marine facilities or shipping could affect the markets in which we operate our business and our expectations. Increased armed hostilities, terrorist attacks or responses from the United States may lead to further acts of terrorism and civil disturbances in the United States or elsewhere, which may further contribute to economic instability in the United States. These attacks or armed conflicts may affect our operations or those of our customers or suppliers and could impact our revenues, our production capability and our ability to complete contracts in a timely manner.\nOur operations are susceptible to adverse weather conditions and natural disasters in our regions of operation.\nOur business, operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected by severe weather and other natural disasters, such as earthquakes, particularly along the Gulf Coast, the West Coast, the Atlantic Seaboard and Caribbean Basin. Repercussions of severe weather conditions may include:\n\u2022\nevacuation of personnel and curtailment of services;\n\u2022\nweather-related damage or catastrophic loss to our equipment, facilities and project work sites resulting in suspension of operations;\n\u2022\ninability to deliver materials to jobsites in accordance with contract schedules;\n\u2022\nloss of productivity; and\n\u2022\ninterruption to projects in process.\nWe are subject to risks related to our international operations.\nWe currently have on-going projects in the Caribbean Basin. International operations subject us to additional risks, including:\n\u2022\nuncertainties concerning import and export license requirements, tariffs and other trade barriers;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on repatriating foreign profits back to the United States;\n\u2022\nchanges in foreign policies and regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing international operations;\n\u2022\ntaxation issues;\n\u2022\ncurrency fluctuations;\n\u2022\npolitical, cultural and economic uncertainties; and\n\u2022\nrisk of expropriation or seizure.\nThese risks could restrict our ability to provide services to international customers and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar international anti-bribery laws.\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d) and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies, their affiliates and intermediaries form making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our policies mandate compliance with the FCPA and these other laws. Our international operations are currently not a significant\nportion of our business; however, despite our compliance programs and internal training, there is no assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will protect us from acts committed by our employees or agents. If we are found to be liable for FCPA or other violations, we could suffer from civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRestrictions on foreign ownership of our vessels could limit our ability to sell off any portion of our business or result in the forfeiture of our vessels or in our inability to continue our operations in United States navigable waters.\nThe Dredging Act, the Jones Act, the Shipping Act and the Vessel Documentation Act require vessels engaged in the transport of merchandise or passengers between two points in the United States or dredging in the navigable waters of the United States to be owned and controlled by United States citizens. The United States citizen ownership and control standards require the vessel-owning entity to be at least 75% U.S. citizen-owned, thus restricting foreign ownership interests in the entities that directly or indirectly own the vessels which we operate. If we were to seek to sell any portion of our business unit that owns any of these vessels, we may have fewer potential purchasers, since some potential purchasers might be unable or unwilling to satisfy the foreign ownership restrictions described above; additionally, any sales of certain of our larger vessels to foreign buyers would be subject to approval by the U.S. Maritime Administration. As a result, the sales price for that portion of our business may not attain the amount that could be obtained in an unregulated market.\nOur strategy of growing through strategic acquisitions may not be successful.\nWe may pursue growth through the acquisition of companies or assets that will enable us to broaden the types of projects we execute and also expand into new markets. We have completed several acquisitions and plan to consider strategic acquisitions in the future. We may be unable to implement this growth strategy if we cannot identify suitable companies or assets or reach agreement on potential strategic acquisitions on acceptable terms. Moreover, an acquisition involves certain risks, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in the integration of operations, systems, policies and procedures;\n\u2022\nenhancements in our controls and procedures including those necessary for a public company may make it more difficult to integrate operations and systems;\n\u2022\nfailure to implement proper overall business controls, including those required to support our growth, resulting in inconsistent operating and financial practices at companies we acquire or have acquired;\n\u2022\ntermination of relationships with the key personnel and customers of an acquired company;\n\u2022\nadditional financial and accounting challenges and complexities in areas such as tax planning, treasury management, financial reporting and internal controls;\n\u2022\nthe incurrence of environmental and other liabilities, including liabilities arising from the operation of an acquired business or asset prior to our acquisition for which we are not indemnified or for which the indemnity is inadequate;\n\u2022\ndisruption of or receipt of insufficient management attention to our ongoing business; and\n\u2022\ninability to realize the cost savings or other financial benefits that we anticipate.\nFuture acquisitions may require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available on attractive terms. Moreover, to the extent an acquisition transaction financed by non-equity consideration results in additional goodwill, it will reduce our tangible net worth, which might have an adverse effect on our credit and bonding capacity.\nWe may be vulnerable to the cyclical nature of the markets in which our customers operate, which may be exacerbated during economic downturns.\nEconomic downturns have affected numerous industries and companies and many states continue to face difficult budget decisions which could result in reduced demand for general construction projects. This reduced demand may increase the number of potential bidders in our markets and could increase the competitive environment through pressure on pricing. Budgeting decisions and constraints due to the tight credit markets may result in diversion of governmental funding from projects we perform to other uses. A weak economy may also produce less tax revenue, thereby decreasing funds for public sector projects. Lower levels of activity may result in a corresponding decline in the demand for our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability.\nNegative conditions in the credit and financial markets could impair our ability to operate our business, or implement our acquisition strategies\nInstability in the credit markets in the United States and abroad, could affect the availability of credit and may make it difficult or expensive to obtain in spite of increased liquidity and low interest rates. We may face challenges if conditions in the financial markets deteriorate. While these conditions have not impaired the Company\u2019s ability to access credit markets and finance\noperations, at this time, there can be no assurance that there will not be a further deterioration in financial markets and confidence in major economies. A continuing shortage of liquidity could have an impact on the lenders under our credit facility or on our customers.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and of Delaware law may make it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of our board of directors and may discourage a takeover or change of control.\nWe are a Delaware corporation. Various anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law impose impediments on the ability of others to acquire control of us, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our shareholders. In addition, certain provisions of our charter and bylaws may impede or discourage a takeover. For example:\n\u2022 our Board of Directors is divided into three classes serving staggered three-year terms;\n\u2022 vacancies on the Board of Directors can only be filled by other directors;\n\u2022 there are various restrictions on the ability of a shareholder to nominate a director for election; and\n\u2022 our Board of Directors can authorize the issuance of preference shares.\nThese types of provisions in our charter and bylaws could also make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our shareholders. Accordingly, shareholders may be limited in the ability to obtain a premium for their shares.\nRisk Factors Relating to Our Accounting, Financial Results and Financing Plans\nActual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions that we use to prepare our financial statements.\nTo prepare financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, management is required to make estimates and assumptions as of the date of the financial statements, which affect the reported values of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Areas requiring significant estimates by our management include: contract costs and profits, application of percentage-of-completion accounting, and revenue recognition of contract change order claims; provisions for uncollectible receivables and customer claims and recoveries of costs from subcontractors, suppliers and others; valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with business combinations; accruals for estimated liabilities, including litigation and insurance reserves; and the value of our deferred tax assets. Our actual results or experience could differ from those estimates.\nOur use of the percentage-of-completion method of accounting could result in a reduction or reversal of previously recorded revenue and profit.\nAs is more fully discussed in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies,\u201d we recognize contract revenue using the percentage-of-completion method. A significant portion of our work is performed on a fixed-price or lump-sum basis. The balance of our work is performed on variations of cost reimbursable and unit price approaches. Contract revenue is accrued based on the percentage that actual incurred costs-to-date bear to total estimated project costs. We utilize this cost-to-cost approach as we believe this method is less subjective than relying on assessments of physical progress. While the cost-to-cost approach is the most widely recognized method used for percentage-of-completion accounting, the use of estimated cost to complete each contract is a significant variable in the process of determining income earned and is a significant factor in the accounting for contracts. The cumulative impact of any revision in total cost estimates during the progress of work is reflected in the period in which these changes become known. Due to the various estimates inherent in our contract accounting, actual results could differ from those estimates, which may result in a reduction or reversal of previously recorded revenue and profit.\nAn impairment charge to goodwill could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAt December 31, 2014, goodwill carried on our Consolidated Balance Sheets was $33.8 million, representing 9.6% of our total assets of $352.3 million. Under U.S. GAAP, we are required to review goodwill not less than annually, and if events or circumstances change between annual tests, for possible impairment based on a fair value approach of our reporting unit.\nChanges in macroeconomic indicators, the overall business climate, a sustained decline in a reporting unit's market value, operating performance indicators, and other factors could affect our assessment of fair value, either through a qualitative approach or through direct testing, and result in an impairment charge with a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in the period in which the charge is taken.\nFailure to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and stock value.\nMaintaining effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and is important in helping to prevent financial fraud. If we are unable to achieve and maintain adequate internal controls, our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed. We are required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSOX\u201d) and the related rules of the SEC to annually assess the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and our independent registered public accounting firm is required to issue a report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. During the course of the related documentation and testing, we may identify significant deficiencies or material weaknesses that we may be unable to remediate before the requisite deadline for those reports. If our management or our independent registered public accounting firm were to conclude in their reports that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective, this could have a material adverse effect on our ability to process and report financial information and the value of our common stock could significantly decline.\nOur effective tax rate may increase or decrease\nSignificant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations in which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe that our tax estimates and tax provisions are reasonable, they could be materially affected by the final outcome of tax audits, the introduction of new tax accounting standards, legislation, regulations and related interpretations, our mix of earnings, the realizability of deferred tax positions and recognition or changes in uncertain tax positions. An increase or decrease in our effective tax rate could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur bonding requirements may limit our ability to incur indebtedness.\nWe generally are required to provide various types of surety bonds that provide an additional measure of security for our performance under certain government and private sector contracts. Our ability to obtain surety bonds depends upon various factors including our capitalization, working capital and amount of our indebtedness. In order to help ensure that we can obtain required bonds, we may be limited in our ability to incur additional indebtedness that may be needed for potential acquisitions and operations. Our inability to incur additional indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nA downturn in economic conditions may impact our customers\u2019 ability to pay for services and finance projects.\nOur primary customers are governmental agencies in the United States, as well as a wide variety of private customers in diverse industries. It is possible that current economic conditions may affect some of our customers\u2019 ability to access sufficient capital to finance or complete projects. Our cash flows may be adversely impacted through customer delays in payment or non-payment of our accounts receivable, or through delays or cancellations of projects awarded to us. We monitor our accounts receivable balances closely and maintain contact with our customers to assess the economic viability of projects in process.\nRisk Factors Relating to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nA significant increase in the foreign ownership of our publicly traded stock may affect our ability to operate in U.S. waters.\nOur certificate of incorporation contains provisions limiting ownership of our capital stock by non-U.S. citizens. The Company performs periodic checks of foreign ownership of its common stock through reports provided by its transfer agent to ensure compliance with the Jones Act, the Dredging Act and other laws regarding the operation of vessels in U.S. waterways. We do not believe that our capital stock owned by non-U.S. citizens is significant in relation to the 25% limitation specified in our certificate of incorporation. However, if we or any of our operating subsidiaries cease to be 75% controlled and owned by U.S. citizens, we would become ineligible to continue our operations in U.S. navigable waters and may become subject to penalties and risk forfeiture of our vessels.\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock may be influenced by many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results, or those of our competitors, public announcements by us or our competitors regarding acquisitions, strategic investments, project awards, the financial market and general economic conditions, changes in\nstock market analyst recommendations, sales of common stock by our executive officers, directors and/or significant stockholders, as well as reactions to those described above under \u201cRisk Factors Relating to Our Business\u201d.\nOur quarterly results may fluctuate significantly, which could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nOur quarterly results of operations may fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors including:\n\u2022\nthe number and significance of projects executed in a quarter;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in spending patterns of our government or commercial customers;\n\u2022\nunanticipated changes in contract performance;\n\u2022\ndelays incurred in connection with a project;\n\u2022\nthe scope of projects under execution in a quarter;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters or other crises;\n\u2022\nutilization rates; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and political conditions.\nThese fluctuations in revenue and/or margin may have a material adverse effect on our stock price.", "PERMNO": 92467, "SIC": 1600, "TIC": "ORN"}
