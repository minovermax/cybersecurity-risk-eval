During economic downturns and periods of stagnant or slow economic growth, federal and state budgets are typically negatively affected, resulting in reduced reimbursements or delayed payments by the federal and state government health care coverage programs in which we participate, including Medicare, Medicaid and other federal or state assistance plans. Government programs could also slow or temporarily suspend payments on Medicaid obligations, negatively impacting our cash flow and increasing our working capital needs and interest payments. We have seen, and believe we will continue to see, Medicare and state Medicaid programs institute measures aimed at controlling spending growth, including reductions in reimbursement rates.\nHigher unemployment rates and significant employment layoffs and downsizings may lead to lower numbers of patients enrolled in employer-provided plans. Adverse economic conditions could also cause employers to stop offering, or limit, healthcare coverage, or modify program designs, shifting more costs to the individual and exposing us to greater credit risk from patients or the discontinuance of therapy.\nExisting and new government legislative and regulatory action could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nOur business is subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations. See \u201cBusiness - Government Regulation.\u201d Changes in these regulations may require extensive changes to our systems and operations that may be difficult to implement. Untimely compliance or noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations could adversely affect the continued operation of our business, including, but not limited to: imposition of civil or criminal penalties; suspension of payments from government programs; loss of required government certifications or approvals; suspension of authorizations to participate in or exclusion from government reimbursement programs; or loss of licensure. Reduction in reimbursement by Medicare, Medicaid and other governmental payors could adversely affect our business as well. The regulations to which we are subject include, but are not limited to, Anti-Kickback laws; federal and state laws prohibiting self-referrals or \u201cStark laws\u201d; HIPAA, as amended by HITECH; False Claims Act; Civil Monetary Penalties Act; regulations of the FDA, U.S. Federal Trade Commission, and the DEA, and regulations of individual state regulatory authorities. In that regard, our business and consolidated financial statements could be affected by one or more of the following:\n\u2022\nfederal and state laws and regulations governing the purchase, distribution, management, compounding, dispensing and reimbursement of prescription drugs and related services, including state and federal controlled substances laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nFDA and/or state regulation affecting the pharmacy or PBM industries;\n\u2022\nrules and regulations issued pursuant to HIPAA and HITECH; and other federal and state laws affecting the use, disclosure and transmission of health information, such as state security breach notification laws and state laws limiting the use and disclosure of prescriber information;\n\u2022\nadministration of Medicare and state Medicaid programs, including legislative changes and/or rulemaking and interpretation;\n\u2022\nfederal and state laws and regulations that require reporting and public dissemination of payments to and between various health care providers and other industry participants;\n\u2022\ngovernment regulation of the development, administration, review and updating of formularies and drug lists;\n\u2022\nmanaged care reform and plan design legislation, including state laws regarding out-of-network charges and participation;\n\u2022\nfederal or state laws governing our relationships with physicians or others in a position to refer to us; and\n\u2022\ninterpretation and enforcement of the DQSA.\nThe Health Reform Law and its implementation could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe Health Reform Law has resulted and will continue to result in sweeping changes to the existing U.S. system for the delivery and financing of health care. While many regulations have already been promulgated, further implementation of certain of the requirements under the Health Reform Law will depend on the promulgation of regulations by a number of federal government agencies, including the HHS. It is impossible to predict the outcome of these changes and the net effect of those requirements on us. As such, we cannot predict the impact of the Health Reform Law on our business, operations or financial performance.\nFederal actions and legislation may reduce reimbursement rates from governmental payors and adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn August 2011, Congress passed a deficit reduction agreement that created a committee tasked with proposing legislation to reduce the federal deficit by November 23, 2011. Because the committee did not act, automatic Medicare cuts were scheduled to go into effect January 1, 2013. However, Congress passed legislation extending the time for such cuts by two months. Thus, Medicare reimbursement to providers was reduced overall by 2% (as part of sequestration) beginning April 1, 2013. The automatic spending cuts did not and will not have an impact on Medicaid reimbursement. The reductions in Medicare reimbursement have not yet been significant but they could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nThese reductions are in addition to reductions mandated by the Health Reform Law, which provides for material reductions in the growth of Medicare program spending. From time to time, CMS revises the reimbursement systems used to reimburse health care providers, which may result in reduced Medicare payments. Because most states must operate with balanced budgets and because the Medicaid program is often a state\u2019s largest program, some states have enacted or may consider enacting legislation designed to reduce their Medicaid expenditures. Further, many states have also adopted, or are considering, legislation designed to reduce coverage and/or enroll Medicaid recipients in managed care programs. The current economic environment has increased the budgetary pressures on many states, and these budgetary pressures have resulted, and likely will continue to result, in decreased spending, or decreased spending growth, for Medicaid programs and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program in many states.\nIn some cases, Third Party Payors rely on all or portions of Medicare payment systems to determine payment rates. Changes to government health care programs that reduce payments under these programs may negatively impact payments from Third Party Payors. Current or future health care reform and deficit reduction efforts, changes in laws or regulations regarding government health care programs, other changes in the administration of government health care programs and changes to Third Party Payors in response to health care reform and other changes to government health care programs could have a material, adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nWe face periodic reviews and billing audits from governmental and private payors, and these audits could have adverse findings that may negatively impact our business.\nAs a result of our participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, we are subject to various governmental reviews and audits to verify our compliance with these programs and applicable laws and regulations. We also are subject to audits under various government programs in which third party firms engaged by CMS conduct extensive reviews of claims data and medical and other records to identify potential improper payments under the Medicare program. Private pay sources also reserve the right to conduct audits. If billing errors are identified in the sample of reviewed claims, the billing error can be extrapolated to all claims filed which could result in a larger overpayment than originally identified in the sample of reviewed claims. Our costs to respond to and defend reviews and audits may be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Moreover, an adverse review or audit could result in:\n\u2022\nrequired refunding or retroactive adjustment of amounts we have been paid by governmental or private payors;\n\u2022\nstate or Federal agencies imposing fines, penalties and other sanctions on us;\n\u2022\nloss of our right to participate in the Medicare program, state programs, or one or more private payor networks; or\n\u2022\ndamage to our business and reputation in various markets.\nThese results could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf any of our pharmacies fail to comply with the conditions of participation in the Medicare program, that pharmacy could be terminated from Medicare, which could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements.\nOur pharmacies must comply with the extensive conditions of participation in the Medicare program. These conditions vary depending on the type of facility, but, in general, require our facilities to meet specified standards relating to licensure, personnel, patient rights, patient care, patient records, physical site, administrative reporting and legal compliance. If a pharmacy fails to meet any of the Medicare supplier standards, that pharmacy could be terminated from the Medicare program. We respond in the ordinary course to deficiency notices issued by surveyors, and none of our pharmacies has ever been terminated from the Medicare program for failure to comply with the supplier standards. Any termination of one or more of our pharmacies from the Medicare program for failure to satisfy the Medicare supplier standards could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements.\nWe cannot predict the impact of new requirements on compounding pharmacies.\nCompounding pharmacies have come under increasing scrutiny from federal and state governmental agencies. We have been responding to requests for additional information on our practices as we receive them. We believe that our compounding is done in safe environments and we have clinically appropriate policies and procedures in place. We only compound pursuant to a patient specific prescription and do so in compliance with USP 797 standards. In November 2013, Congress passed the DQSA, which creates a new category of compounders called outsourcing facilities, which are newly-regulated by the FDA. We do not believe that our current compounding practices qualify us as an outsourcing facility and therefore we continue to operate in compliance with USP 797 standards. Should state regulators or the FDA disagree, or should our business practices change to qualify us as an outsourcing facility, there is a risk of regulatory action and/or increased resources required to comply with federal requirements imposed by the DQSA on outsourcing facilities that would significantly increase our costs or otherwise affect our results of operations. Furthermore, we cannot predict the implications and overall impact of increased scrutiny on compounding pharmacies.\nCompetition in the healthcare industry could reduce profit margins.\nThe healthcare industry is very competitive. Our competitors include large and well-established companies that may have greater financial, marketing and technological resources than we do. Some of our competitors are under common control with, or owned by, pharmaceutical wholesalers and distributors, managed care organizations, pharmacy benefit managers or retail pharmacy chains and may be better positioned with respect to the cost-effective distribution of pharmaceuticals. In addition, some of our competitors may have secured long-term supply or distribution arrangements for prescription pharmaceuticals necessary to treat certain chronic disease states on price terms substantially more favorable than the terms currently available to us. As a result of such advantageous pricing, we may be less price competitive than some of these competitors with respect to certain pharmaceutical products. Our competitive position could also be adversely affected by any inability to obtain access to new biotech pharmaceutical products.\nChanges in the case mix of patients, as well as payment methodologies, payor mix or pricing could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements.\nThe sources and amounts of our patient revenue are determined by a number of factors, including the mix of patients and the rates of reimbursement among payors. Changes in the case mix of the patients, payment methodologies, payor mix or pricing among private pay, Medicare and Medicaid may significantly affect our consolidated financial statements.\nChanges in industry pricing benchmarks could adversely affect our financial performance.\nContracts within our business generally use certain published benchmarks to establish pricing for the reimbursement of prescription medications dispensed by us. These benchmarks include AWP, wholesale acquisition cost and average manufacturer price. Many of our contracts utilize the AWP benchmark. As a part of the settlement of class-action lawsuits brought against First DataBank and Medi-Span, effective September 26, 2009, both companies announced they would cease publication of the AWP pricing benchmarks at the end of 2011. First DataBank ceased publication of the AWP pricing benchmarks on September 28, 2011. Without a suitable pricing benchmark in place many of our contracts will have to be modified and could potentially change the economic structure of our agreements. As of the date of this report, a viable generally accepted alternative to the AWP benchmark has not been developed by the industry, and Medi-Span has announced they will continue to publish AWP until a new benchmark is widely accepted.\nCompetitive bidding could reduce our volumes and profitability.\nThe Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 established requirements for a competitive bidding program for determining Medicare reimbursement rates for certain items of durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics and supplies (\u201cDMEPOS\u201d), including enteral nutrients, supplies and equipment, certain respiratory therapy and home medical equipment products and external infusion pumps and supplies. CMS has the discretion to determine which products will be subject to competitive bidding.\nAlthough we are contract suppliers under the Round 1 Recompete and Round 2 of competitive bidding and have entered into strategic relationships in the Competitive Bidding Areas (\u201cCBAs\u201d) in which we were not awarded contracts, the prices paid under the competitive bid contracts are below what Medicare had previously paid. Because of this, even in CBAs where we continue to provide competitively bid items to Medicare beneficiaries, we have seen and may continue to see decreased revenues. Continued expansion of the competitive bidding program could also have a negative impact on our revenue if we are not a successful bidder in many or all of the CBAs for the product categories included that we offer. Further, the Affordable Care Act mandated use of information from the DMEPOS competitive bidding program to adjust the fee schedule amounts by January 1, 2016 for DMEPOS in areas where competitive bidding programs are not implemented. The establishment of new fee schedule pricing for areas where competitive bidding are not implemented, which is based on competitive bid prices, could have a further negative impact on our revenue.\nOur inability to effectively and timely transition to the new ICD-10 coding system could disrupt our operations.\nCMS has mandated that all providers implement the use of new patient codes for medical coding, referred to as ICD-10 codes, on or before October 1, 2015. This mandate substantially increases the number of medical billing codes by which providers will seek reimbursement, increasing the complexity of submitting claims for reimbursement. Claims submitted after October 1, 2015 must use ICD-10 codes or they will not be paid. Transition to the new ICD-10 system requires changes to our clinical software system as well as the training of staff involved in the coding and billing processes. In addition to these upfront costs of transition to ICD-10, it is possible that we could experience disruption or delays in payment due to implementation issues, including software errors, coding errors or a decrease in the productivity of our staff involved in the coding and billing processes. Any such delays in payment could disrupt our operations and materially and adversely affect our business.\nPBM client demands for enhanced service levels or possible loss or unfavorable modification of contracts with clients or providers could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements.\nAs our PBM clients face long-term, sustained increases in prescription drug costs, they may demand additional services and enhanced service levels to help mitigate the increase in spending. We operate in a very competitive environment, and we may not be able to increase our fees to compensate for these increased services, which could put pressure on our margins.\nOur contracts with PBM clients generally do not have terms longer than three years and, in some cases, may be terminated by the client on relatively short notice, typically 90 days. Our PBM clients generally seek bids from other PBM or specialty providers in advance of the expiration of their contracts. If several of these clients elect not to extend their relationship with us, and we are not successful in generating sales to replace the lost business, our future business and operating results could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, we believe the managed care industry is undergoing substantial consolidation, and another party that is not our client could acquire some of our managed care clients. In such case, there is a risk of contract loss and a loss of the associated revenues and profit.\nThere are approximately 60,000 retail pharmacies in the United States. All major retail chain pharmacies and a vast majority of independent pharmacies participate in our pharmacy network. The top ten retail pharmacy chains represent approximately 50% of the total number of stores and over 90% of prescriptions filled in our network. Our contracts with retail pharmacies, which are non-exclusive, are generally terminable on relatively short notice. If one or more of the top pharmacy chains elects to terminate its relationship with us, our members\u2019 access to retail pharmacies and our business could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, many large pharmacy chains either own PBMs today, or could attempt to acquire a PBM in the future. Increased ownership of PBMs by retail pharmacy chains could materially and adversely affect our relationships with those pharmacy chains and, accordingly, our consolidated financial statements.\nContract renewals, or lack thereof, with key revenue sources and key business relationships could result in less favorable pricing, loss of exclusivity and/or reduced distribution and access to customers, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are renegotiating, on a rolling basis, contracts and business relationships with key revenue sources, including Third Party Payors, Plan Sponsors, network pharmacies, and discount card brokers. Our future growth and success depends on our ability to maintain these relationships and renew such contracts on acceptable terms. However, we may not be able to continue to maintain these relationships which grant us access to certain customers and distribution channels. Any break in these key business relationships could result in lost contracts and reduce our access to certain customers and distribution channels. Further, when such contracts near expiration, we may not be able to successfully renegotiate acceptable terms. Any increase in pricing or loss of exclusivity could result in reduced margins. Accordingly, it is possible that our ongoing efforts to renew contracts and business relationships with such key revenue sources as Third Party Payors, Plan Sponsors, network pharmacies and discount card brokers could result in less favorable pricing, loss of exclusivity or even reduced access to customers and distribution channels, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. As discussed in the risk factor titled \u201cPBM client demands for enhanced service levels or possible loss or unfavorable modification of contracts with clients or providers could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements,\u201d even when such contracts are renewed, they may be renewed for only a short term or may be terminable on relatively short notice.\nWe and certain of our directors and executive officers have been named as defendants in a consolidated class action lawsuit that could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention, and we may be subject to similar lawsuits in the future.\nWe, and certain of our current and former directors and executive officers, have been named as defendants in two purported class action lawsuits that generally allege that we and certain of our directors and officers violated Sections 11, 12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d), Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d) and Rule 10b-5 promulgated under the Exchange Act by making allegedly false and misleading statements and/or omissions pertaining to (i) the distribution of the Novartis Pharmaceutical Corporation\u2019s product Exjade\u00ae (the \u201cMedication\u201d) by our legacy specialty pharmacy division that was divested in May 2012 (the \u201cLegacy Division\u201d) and (ii) our PBM Services segment. On December 19, 2013, the two class action lawsuits were consolidated into a single consolidated class action lawsuit and a lead plaintiff was appointed. The lead plaintiff filed a consolidated complaint on February 19, 2014. The consolidated complaint seeks damages and other relief. All defendants in the case moved to dismiss the consolidated complaint on April 28, 2014. Briefing on the motion to dismiss was complete on July 28, 2014.\nWe intend to engage in a vigorous defense of the consolidated lawsuit. However, we are unable to predict the outcome of this matter at this time. Moreover, any conclusion of this matter in a manner adverse to us would have an adverse effect on our financial condition and business. Even if we were to be successful in the defense of the litigation, we could incur substantial costs not covered by our directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance, suffer a significant adverse impact on our reputation and divert management\u2019s attention and resources from other priorities, including the execution of business plans and strategies that are important to our ability to grow our business, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, while we believe based on current information that this matter is covered by applicable insurance and we intend to engage in a vigorous defense of the consolidated lawsuit, nevertheless, this matter could require payments (including payments with respect of legal expenses) that are not covered by, or exceed the limits of, our available directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance, which could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nPending and future litigation could subject us to significant monetary damages and/or require us to change our business practices.\nWe are subject to risks relating to litigation and other proceedings in connection with our operations, including the dispensing of pharmaceutical products. See Item 3 - Legal Proceedings for a description of material proceedings pending against us. We believe that these suits are without merit and, to the extent not already concluded, intend to contest them vigorously. However, an adverse outcome in one or more of these suits may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, consolidated financial position and/or consolidated cash flow from operations, or may require us to make material changes to our business practices. For instance, effective January 8, 2014 we entered into a Stipulation and Order of Settlement and Dismissal (the \u201cFederal Settlement Agreement\u201d) with the U.S. Department of Justice (the \u201cDOJ\u201d) and qui tam relator David M. Kester (the \u201cRelator\u201d), and effective February 11, 2014, we entered into State Settlement Agreements (collectively, the \u201cState Settlement Agreements\u201d, and together with the Federal Settlement Agreement the \u201cSettlement Agreements\u201d) with the offices of the Attorneys General of 34 states (collectively, the \u201cSettling States\u201d). The Settlement Agreements provide for aggregate payments of $15.0 million plus interest to settle civil claims under the False Claims Act and related statutes and common law claims that could be brought by the DOJ, Relator or Settling States that arise out of the Legacy Division\u2019s distribution of the Medication.\nWe periodically respond to subpoenas and requests for information from governmental agencies, including the civil investigative demand from the United States Attorney\u2019s Office (the \u201cUSAO\u201d) for the Southern District of New York (the \u201cSDNY\u201d) and the subpoena from relevant state governments related to certain operations by our Legacy Division, as discussed above. We confirm that, to our knowledge, we are not a target or a potential subject of a criminal investigation. Except to the extent already concluded as discussed above, we cannot predict with certainty what the outcome of any of the foregoing might be or whether we may in the future become a target or potential target of an investigation or the subject of further inquiries or ultimately settlements with respect to the subject matter of these subpoenas. In addition to potential monetary liability arising from these suits and proceedings, from time to time we incur costs in providing documents to government agencies. Current pending claims and associated costs may be covered by our insurance, but certain other costs are not insured. Such costs may increase and/or continue to be material to our performance in the future.\nIn addition, as we continue our strategic assessment and cost reduction efforts, there is an increased risk of employment and workers compensation-related litigation and/or administrative claims brought against us. We would defend against any and all such litigation and claims, as appropriate. Such claims could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements in any particular reporting period.\nWe may face liabilities relating to the sale of the Home Health Business.\nWe are still subject to potential liabilities relating to the sale of the Home Health Business. Under the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement, we are obligated to indemnify the Buyer against certain potential liabilities related to operations prior to the sale and for breaches of representations, warranties and covenants under the Stock Purchase Agreement.\nOur acquisition strategy exposes us to a variety of operational and financial risks.\nA principal element of our business strategy has been to grow by acquiring other companies and assets in the home infusion and complementary businesses. Growth, especially rapid growth, through acquisitions exposes us to a variety of operational and financial risks. We summarize the most significant of these risks below.\nIntegration risks. We must integrate our acquisitions with our existing operations. This process includes the integration of the various components of our business (including the following) and of the businesses we have acquired or may acquire in the future:\n\u2022\nhealth care professionals and employees who are not familiar with our policies and procedures;\n\u2022\nclients who may terminate their relationships with us;\n\u2022\nkey employees who may seek employment elsewhere;\n\u2022\npatients who may elect to switch to another health care provider;\n\u2022\nregulatory compliance programs; and\n\u2022\ndisparate operating, information and record keeping systems and technology platforms.\nIntegrating an acquisition could be expensive and time consuming and could disrupt our ongoing business, negatively affect cash flow and distract management and other key personnel from day-to-day operations.\nWe may not be able to combine successfully the operations of recently acquired companies with our operations, and, even if such integration is accomplished, we may never realize the potential benefits of the acquisition. The integration of acquisitions requires significant attention from management, may impose substantial demands on our operations or other projects and may impose challenges on the combined business including, but not limited to, consistencies in business standards, procedures, policies and business cultures. If we fail to complete ongoing integration efforts, we may never fully realize the potential benefits of the related acquisitions.\nBenefits may not materialize. When evaluating potential acquisition targets, we identify potential synergies and cost savings that we expect to realize upon the successful completion of the acquisition and the integration of the related operations. We may, however, be unable to achieve or may otherwise never realize the expected benefits. Our ability to realize the expected benefits from improvements to companies we acquire are subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control, such as changes to government regulation governing or otherwise impacting our industry, reductions in reimbursement rates from Third Party Payors, reductions in service levels under our contracts, operating difficulties, client preferences, changes in competition and general economic or industry conditions. If we are unsuccessful in implementing these improvements or if we do not achieve our expected results, it may adversely impact our results of operations.\nAssumptions of unknown liabilities. Companies that we acquire may have unknown or contingent liabilities, including, but not limited to, liabilities for failure to comply with healthcare laws and regulations. We may incur material liabilities for the past\nactivities of acquired operations. Such liabilities and related legal or other costs and/or resulting damage to our reputation could negatively impact our business through lower-than-expected operating results, charges for impairment of acquired intangible assets or otherwise.\nCompeting for acquisitions. We face competition for acquisition candidates primarily from other home infusion and other healthcare companies. Some of our competitors have greater resources than we do. As a result, we may pay more to acquire a target business or may agree to less favorable deal terms than we would have otherwise. Accurately assessing the value of acquisition candidates is often very challenging. Also, suitable acquisitions may not be available due to unfavorable terms.\nFurther, the cost of an acquisition could result in a dilutive effect on our results of operations, depending on various factors, including the amount paid for in an acquisition, the acquired entity\u2019s results of operations, the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, effects of subsequent legislation and limits on rate increases.\nImproving financial results. Some of the operations we have acquired or may acquire in the future may have had significantly lower operating margins than our current operations. If we fail to improve the operating margins of the companies we acquire, operate such companies profitably or effectively integrate the operations of the acquired companies, our results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nAcquisitions, strategic investments and strategic relationships involve certain risks.\nWe intend to pursue opportunistic strategic acquisitions of, or investments in, businesses and technologies. Acquisitions may entail numerous risks, including difficulties in assessing values for acquired businesses, intangible assets and technologies, difficulties in the assimilation of acquired operations and products, diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, assumption of unknown material liabilities of acquired companies, amortization of acquired intangible assets which could reduce future reported earnings, and potential loss of clients or key employees of acquired companies. We may not be able to successfully fully integrate the operations, personnel, services or products that we have acquired or may acquire in the future. Strategic investments may also entail some of the risks described above. If these investments are unsuccessful, we may need to incur charges against earnings. We may also pursue a number of strategic relationships. These relationships and others we may enter into in the future may be important to our business and growth prospects. We may not be able to maintain these relationships or develop new strategic alliances.\nWe may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or business and investment opportunities.\nWe intend to continue to explore strategic alternatives and identify new business acquisition opportunities. We may not be able to identify such new business acquisition opportunities or strategic alternatives to continue to execute our strategy.\nStrategic investments, relationships and alternatives involve certain risks, and we may incur significant costs in connection with our evaluation of new business opportunities and suitable acquisition candidates.\nOur management intends to identify, analyze and evaluate potential new business opportunities, including possible acquisition and merger candidates. We may incur significant costs, such as due diligence and legal and other professional fees and expenses, as part of these efforts. Notwithstanding these efforts and expenditures, we may not be able to identify an appropriate new business opportunity, or any acquisition opportunity, in the near term, or at all.\nIf our remedial measures are insufficient to address material weaknesses and we are unable to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, timely file our periodic reports, maintain our reporting status or prevent fraud.\nIn connection with our management\u2019s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, we concluded there were two material weaknesses. The first material weakness related to the establishment of accounts receivable related reserves and the timely recognition of bad debt expense, and the second related to certain clerical errors and documentation omissions in the contingent consideration calculations that were provided to our auditors.\nIn addition, in connection with our management\u2019s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, we concluded there were two new material weaknesses. The first new material weakness related to our general information technology controls (\u201cGITCs\u201d) not being complete, and the second related to our internal control over the accounting for significant and unusual transactions not being adequate to detect a material misstatement in our consolidated financial statements.\nUnder standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, a material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented, detected or corrected on a timely basis.\nThe material weakness related to the contingent consideration calculations was remediated in the first quarter of 2014. In order to remediate the material weakness related to the establishment of accounts receivable related reserves, we (i) standardized processes, procedures and productivity measures for intake, billing, collection and cash application processes; (ii) converted all sites to a single version of our pharmacy and accounts receivable system; (iii) centralized the cash application function and implemented technology upgrades to improve the accuracy and timeliness of cash application and secondary payor billing; and (iv) developed a robust estimation methodology for the allowance for doubtful accounts and contractual adjustments that uses historical collection and write-off data from acquired sites. We implemented and utilized these new measures throughout 2014. However, management evaluated and tested the effectiveness of the design and operation of our internal control over financial reporting and concluded that the material weakness related to the establishment of accounts receivable related reserves and the timely recognition of bad debt expense still existed as of December 31, 2014.\nIn order to remediate the material weaknesses our management identified as of December 31, 2014, we are (i) reviewing the GITCs to ensure that specific roles and responsibilities are evaluated and duties within our information technology environments are segregated; (ii) reviewing the need for additional corporate accounting and finance personnel and external resources to ensure that we have an effective system of internal controls related to significant and unusual transactions; and (iii) improving our processes and analyses performed by management that support the estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts and the related bad debt expense.\nIf our remedial measures are insufficient to address the material weaknesses, or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting are discovered or occur in the future, then there exists a risk that our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements that are unknown to us at that time, and such misstatements could require us to restate our financial results. Our management or our independent registered public accounting firm may identify other material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the future. The existence of a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting may result in current and potential stockholders losing confidence in our financial reporting, which could negatively impact the market price of our common stock.\nIn addition, the existence of material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting may affect our ability to timely file periodic reports under the Exchange Act and may consequently result in the SEC revoking the registration of our common stock, the NASDAQ Global Market delisting our common stock or a default or an event of default under our Senior Credit Facilities and our 2021 Notes (each, as defined below). Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock or on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to liability claims for damages and other expenses that are not covered by insurance.\nA successful product or professional liability claim in excess of our insurance coverage could harm our consolidated financial statements. Various aspects of our business may subject us to litigation and liability for damages. For example, a prescription drug dispensing error could result in a patient receiving the wrong or incorrect amount of medication, leading to personal injury or death. Our business and consolidated financial statements could suffer if we pay damages or defense costs in connection with a claim that is outside the scope of any applicable contractual indemnity or insurance coverage.\nChanges in our relationships with pharmaceutical suppliers, including changes in drug availability or pricing, could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nWe have contractual relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers to purchase the drugs that we dispense. Any changes to these relationships, including, but not limited, to loss of a manufacturer relationship, drug shortages or changes in pricing, could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nWe purchase a majority of our pharmaceutical products from one vendor and a disruption in our purchasing arrangements could adversely impact our business.\nWe purchase a majority of our prescription products, subject to certain minimum periodic purchase levels and excluding purchases of therapeutic plasma products, from a single wholesaler, AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation, or ABDC, pursuant to a prime vendor agreement. The term of this agreement extends until December 2018, subject to extension for up to two additional years. Any significant disruption in our relationship with ABDC, or in ABDC\u2019s supply and timely delivery of products to us, would make it difficult and possibly more costly for us to continue to operate our business until we are able to execute a replacement\nwholesaler agreement. We may not be able to find a replacement wholesaler on a timely basis or that such wholesaler would be able to fulfill our demands on similar financial terms and service levels. If we are unable to identify a replacement on substantially similar financial terms and/or service levels, our consolidated financial statements may be materially and adversely affected.\nA disruption in supply could adversely impact our business.\nWe also source pharmaceuticals, medical supplies and equipment from other manufacturers, distributors and wholesalers. Most of the pharmaceuticals that we purchase are available from multiple sources, and we believe they are available in sufficient quantities to meet our needs and the needs of our patients. We keep safety stock to ensure continuity of service for reasonable, but limited, periods of time. Should a supply disruption result in the inability to obtain especially high margin drugs and compound components, our consolidated financial statements could be negatively impacted.\nPrescription volumes may decline, and our net revenues and profitability may be negatively impacted, when products are withdrawn from the market or when increased safety risk profiles of specific drugs result in utilization decreases.\nWe dispense significant volumes of prescription medications from our pharmacies. Our dispensing volume is the principal driver of revenue and profitability. When products are withdrawn by manufacturers, or when increased safety risk profiles of specific drugs or classes of drugs result in utilization decreases, physicians may cease writing or reduce the numbers of prescriptions written for these higher-risk drugs. Additionally, negative media reports regarding drugs with higher safety risk profiles may result in reduced consumer demand for such drugs. In cases where there are no acceptable prescription drug equivalents or alternatives for these prescription drugs, our prescription volumes, net revenues, profitability and cash flows may decline.\nHome infusion joint ventures formed with hospitals could adversely affect our financial results.\nThe home infusion industry is currently seeing renewed activity in the formation of equity-based infusion joint ventures formed with hospitals. This activity stems, in part, from hospitals seeking to position themselves for new paradigms in the delivery of coordinated healthcare and new methods of payment, including an emerging interdisciplinary care model forming that is being labeled as an accountable care organization, or ACO. These organizations are encouraged by the new Health Reform Law. These entities are being designed in order to save money and improve quality of care by better integrating care, with the healthcare provider possibly sharing in the financial benefits of the new efficiencies.\nParticipation in equity-based joint ventures offer hospitals and other providers an opportunity to more efficiently transfer patients to less expensive care settings, while keeping the patient within its network. Additionally, it provides many hospitals with a mechanism to invest accumulated profits in a growing sector with attractive margins.\nIf these home infusion joint ventures continue to expand and we lose referrals as a result, our consolidated financial statements could be adversely affected.\nNetwork lock-outs by health insurers and PBMs could adversely affect our financial results.\nMany Plan Sponsors and PBMs continue to create exclusive pharmacy networks which limit a member\u2019s access to a mail service facility or network of preferred pharmacies. To the extent our pharmacies are excluded from these networks, we are unable to dispense medications to those members and bill for prescriptions to those member\u2019s insurance carriers. If these specialty networks continue to expand and we are locked out from dispensing infusion medications to members of exclusive networks, our consolidated financial statements could be adversely affected.\nA shortage of qualified registered nursing staff, pharmacists and other professionals could adversely affect our ability to attract, train and retrain qualified personnel and could increase operating costs.\nOur business relies significantly on its ability to attract and retain nursing staff, pharmacists and other professionals who possess the skills, experience and licenses necessary to meet the requirements of their job responsibilities. From time to time and particularly in recent years, there have been shortages of nursing staff, pharmacists and other professionals in certain local and regional markets. As such, we are often required to compete for personnel with other healthcare systems and our competitors. Our ability to attract and retain personnel depends on several factors, including our ability to provide them with engaging assignments and competitive salaries and benefits. We may not be successful in any of these areas.\nIn addition, where labor shortages arise in markets in which we operate, we may face higher costs to attract personnel, and we may have to provide them with more attractive benefit packages than originally anticipated or are being paid in other markets where such shortages don\u2019t exist at the time. In either case, such circumstances could cause our profitability to decline. Finally,\nif we expand our operations into geographic areas where healthcare providers historically have unionized or unionization occurs in our existing geographic areas, negotiating collective bargaining agreements may have a negative effect on our ability to timely and successfully recruit qualified personnel and on our financial results. If we are unable to attract and retain nursing staff, pharmacists and other professionals, the quality of our services may decline and we could lose patients and referral sources.\nIntroduction of new drugs or accelerated adoption of existing lower margin drugs could cause us to experience lower revenues and profitability when prescribers prescribe these drugs for their patients or they are mandated by Plan Sponsors.\nThe pharmaceutical industry pipeline of new drugs includes many drugs that over the long term may replace older, more expensive therapies. As a result of such older drugs going off patent and being replaced by generic substitutes, new and less expensive delivery methods (such as when an infusion or injectable drug is replaced with an oral drug) or additional products are added to a therapeutic class, thereby increasing price competition among competing manufacturer\u2019s products in that therapeutic category. In such cases, manufacturers have the ability to increase drug acquisition costs or lower the selling price of replaced products. This could have the effect of lowering our revenues and/or margins.\nAny changes to our relationships with our discount card brokers or changes in their efforts could negatively impact our business and financial results.\nWe contract with over 95 marketing companies that provide pharmacy discount cards to the uninsured and underinsured. Depending on the amount of revenue generated by any broker agreement, one or more terminations could have a material and adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. The brokers we use are typically small, privately held marketing companies. Several of the large chain pharmacies are heavily promoting their own store discount cards, which has had a negative impact on volume for the discount card business. Because of the reduced volume, some of our discount card brokers have reduced their efforts because response rates to their marketing campaigns have decreased. These decreases in volume could negatively impact our business and financial results.\nIncreases in costs to fulfill discount card claims could reduce our profitability.\nThe discount card portion of our PBM business relies on participating network pharmacies to fulfill drug prescriptions and reimburse us for the utilization of the card. Our fees are based on negotiated rates with the pharmacies. Should these fees decrease, operating profit will be reduced.\nActs of God such as major weather disturbances could disrupt our business.\nWe operate in a network of prescribers, providers, patients and facilities that can be negatively impacted by local weather disturbances and other force majeure events. For example, in anticipation of major weather events, patients with impaired health may be moved to alternate sites. After a major weather event, availability of electricity, clean water and transportation can impact our ability to provide service in the home. In addition, acts of God and other force majeure events may cause a reduction in our business or increased costs, such as increased costs in our operations as we incur overtime charges or redirect services to other locations, delays in our ability to work with payors, hospitals, physicians and other strategic partners on new business initiatives, and disruption to referral patterns as patients are moved out of facilities affected by such events or are unable to return to sites of service in the home.\nFailure to develop new services may adversely affect our business.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment. We develop new services from time to time to assist our clients. If we are unsuccessful in developing innovative services, our ability to attract new clients and retain existing clients may suffer.\nTechnology is also an important component of our business as we continue to utilize new and better channels to communicate and interact with our clients, members and business partners. If our competitors are more successful than us in employing this technology, our ability to attract new clients, retain existing clients and operate efficiently may suffer.\nCybersecurity risks could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which may harm our ability to operate effectively and may cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nCybersecurity refers to the combination of technologies, processes and procedures established to protect information technology systems and data from unauthorized access, attack, or damage. We rely on our information systems to provide security for processing, transmission and storage of confidential information about our patients, customers and personnel, such as names, addresses and other individually identifiable information protected by HIPAA and other privacy laws. Cyber-attacks are\nincreasingly more common, including in the health care industry. The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with the frequent imposition of new and changing requirements. Compliance with changes in privacy and information security laws and with rapidly evolving industry standards may result in our incurring significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes.\nWe have not experienced any known attacks on our information technology systems that compromised any confidential information. We maintain our information technology systems with safeguard protection against cyber-attacks including passive intrusion protection, firewalls and virus detection software. However, these safeguards do not ensure that a significant cyber-attack could not occur. Although we have taken steps to protect the security of our information systems and the data maintained in those systems, it is possible that our safety and security measures will not prevent the systems\u2019 improper functioning or damage or the improper access or disclosure of personally identifiable information such as in the event of cyber-attacks.\nSecurity breaches, including physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, attacks by hackers and similar breaches can create system disruptions or shutdowns or the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. If personal information or protected health information is improperly accessed, tampered with or disclosed as a result of a security breach, we may incur significant costs to notify and mitigate potential harm to the affected individuals, and we may be subject to sanctions and civil or criminal penalties if we are found to be in violation of the privacy or security rules under HIPAA or other similar federal or state laws protecting confidential personal information. In addition, a security breach of our information systems could damage our reputation, subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties for compromised personal information and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe success of our business depends on maintaining a well-secured business and technology infrastructure.\nWe are dependent on our infrastructure, including our information systems, for many aspects of our business operations. A fundamental requirement for our business is the secure storage and transmission of protected health information and other confidential data. Our business and operations may be harmed if we do not maintain our business processes and information systems in a secure manner, and maintain and continually improve the integrity of our confidential information. Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect information against security breaches, failure to protect our confidential information or mitigate harm caused by such breaches may adversely affect our operating results. Malfunctions in our business processes, breaches of our information systems or the failure to maintain effective and up-to-date information systems could disrupt our business operations, result in customer and member disputes, damage our reputation, expose us to risk of loss or litigation, result in regulatory violations and related costs and penalties, increase administrative expenses or lead to other adverse consequences.\nOur business is dependent on the services provided by third party information technology vendors.\nOur information technology infrastructure includes hosting services provided by third parties. While we believe these third parties are high-performing organizations with secure platforms and customary certifications, they could suffer a security breach or business interruption which in turn could impact our operations negatively. In addition, changes in pricing terms charged by our technology vendors may adversely affect our financial performance.\nOur failure to maintain controls and processes over billing and collecting could have a significant negative impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nThe collection of accounts receivable is a significant challenge, and requires constant focus and involvement by management and ongoing enhancements to information systems and billing center operating procedures. If we are unable to properly bill and collect our accounts receivable, our results could be materially and adversely affected. While management believes that our controls and processes are satisfactory, our accounts receivable collectability may not remain at current levels.\nDelays in payment may adversely affect our working capital.\nOur business is characterized by delays from the time we provide services to the time we receive payment for these services. If we have difficulty in obtaining documentation, experience information system problems or experience other issues that arise with Medicare or other payors, we may encounter additional delays in our payment cycle.\nIn addition, timing delays may cause working capital shortages. Working capital management, including prompt and diligent billing and collection, is an important factor in achieving our financial results and maintaining liquidity. It is possible that documentation support, system problems, Medicare or other provider issues or industry trends may extend our collection period,\nwhich may materially adversely affect our working capital, and our working capital management procedures may not successfully mitigate this risk.\nOur ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income for U.S. federal tax purposes is subject to limitation, and our issuance of common stock in the merger with Critical Homecare Solutions Holdings, Inc. (\"\u201cCHS\u201d\") increased the risk that we could experience an \u201cownership change\u201d in the future that could further limit our ability to utilize our net operating losses.\nUnder U.S. federal income tax law, a corporation\u2019s ability to utilize its net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) to offset future taxable income may be significantly limited if it experiences an \u201cownership change\u201d as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended. In general, an ownership change will occur if there is a cumulative change in a corporation\u2019s ownership by \u201c5-percent shareholders\u201d that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. A corporation that experiences an ownership change will generally be subject to an annual limitation on the use of its pre-ownership change NOLs equal to the value of the corporation immediately before the ownership change, multiplied by the long-term tax-exempt rate (subject to certain adjustments). The annual limitation for a taxable year generally is increased by the amount of any \u201crecognized built-in gains\u201d for such year and the amount of any unused annual limitation in a prior year. Any limitation to our annual use of NOLs could require us to pay a greater amount of U.S. federal (and in some cases, state) income taxes, which could reduce our after-tax income from operations for future taxable years and adversely impact our financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nWe incurred substantial additional indebtedness to refinance our prior indebtedness and to finance our acquisition of the CarePoint Business, which imposes operating and financial restrictions on us that, together with the resulting debt service obligations, may significantly limit our ability to execute our business strategy and may increase the risk of default under our debt obligations.\nWe have entered into (i) a senior secured first-lien revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $75.0 million (the \u201cRevolving Credit Facility\u201d), (ii) a senior secured first-lien term loan B in an aggregate principal amount of $250.0 million (the \u201cTerm Loan B Facility\u201d) and (iii) a senior secured first-lien delayed draw term loan B in an aggregate principal amount of $150.0 million (the \u201cDelayed Draw Term Loan Facility\u201d and, together with the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan B Facility, the \u201cSenior Credit Facilities\u201d). A portion of the proceeds of the loans advanced to us on the closing date of the Senior Credit Facilities were used to refinance certain existing indebtedness of ours and our subsidiaries, including the repayment in full of all amounts outstanding under the Prior Credit Facility, the payment of the purchase price for our 10 1/4% senior unsecured notes due 2015 (the \u201c2015 Notes\u201d) tendered and accepted for purchase in the Offer and the payment of the redemption price for the 2015 Notes that remained outstanding after completion of the Offer. The Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility was fully funded in connection with the closing of our acquisition of the CarePoint Business, and the proceeds were used to fund a portion of the purchase price for such acquisition. The proceeds of all other loans advanced under the Senior Credit Facilities have been or will be used to fund working capital and other general corporate purposes of BioScrip and its subsidiaries, including acquisitions, investments and capital expenditures. Our indebtedness may significantly limit our ability to execute our business strategy.\nIn addition, we have issued $200.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 8.875% senior notes due 2021 (the \u201c2021 Notes\u201d). See \u201cItem 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d The 2021 Notes are our senior unsecured obligations and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries. Pursuant to the terms of the Second Amendment to the Senior Credit Facilities, we used approximately $194.5 million of the net proceeds of the 2021 Notes offering to repay $59.3 million of our Revolving Credit Facility and $135.2 million related to the Term Loans Facilities. Interest is payable semi-annually on February 1 and August 1. At our option, we may redeem some or all of the 2021 Notes prior to maturity.\nThe operating and financial restrictions and covenants of our debt instruments, including the Senior Credit Facilities and the indenture governing the 2021 Notes, may adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities that may be in our interest. The terms of the Senior Credit Facilities require us to comply with certain financial covenants, including a maximum leverage ratio (which will be tested to the extent that advances under the Revolving Credit Facility exceed 25% of the maximum amount able to be drawn thereunder). In addition, subject to a number of important exceptions, the Senior Credit Facilities contain certain restrictions on our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred stock;\n\u2022\ntransfer or sell assets;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments and loans;\n\u2022\npay dividends or distributions, redeem subordinated indebtedness, or make other restricted payments;\n\u2022\ncreate or incur liens;\n\u2022\nincur dividend or other payment restrictions affecting certain subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nissue capital stock of our subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nenter into hedging transactions or sale and leaseback transactions;\n\u2022\nconsummate a merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets or the assets of any of our subsidiaries; and\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates.\nThe indenture governing the 2021 Notes contains similar restrictions. Our ability to comply with these covenants, including the financial covenant, may be affected by events beyond our control. Therefore, in order to engage in some corporate actions, we may need to seek permission from our lenders or the note holders, whose interests may be different from ours and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain such consent when needed. If we do not comply with the restrictions and covenants in our Senior Credit Facilities, we may not be able to finance our future operations, make acquisitions or pursue business opportunities. The restrictions contained in our Senior Credit Facilities may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business and may make it difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy or effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted. Additionally, we cannot assure you that we will be able to satisfy the maximum leverage ratio in the event that such financial covenant is tested or that the lenders under the Senior Credit Facilities will waive any failure to meet that test.\nA breach of any of these covenants or the inability to comply with the required financial ratio could result in a default under the Senior Credit Facilities. If any such default occurs, the lenders under the Senior Credit Facilities may elect to declare all of their respective outstanding debt, together with accrued interest and other amounts payable thereunder, to be immediately due and payable. Under such circumstances, we may not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations. In addition, the limitations imposed on our ability to incur additional debt and to take other corporate actions might significantly impair our ability to obtain other financing.\nAlthough we entered into a First Amendment, Second Amendment and Third Amendment with respect to the Senior Credit Facilities on December 23, 2013, January 31, 2014 and March 1, 2015, respectively, there can be no assurance that we will be granted future waivers or amendments to the restrictions in the Senior Credit Facilities if for any reason we are unable to comply with such restrictions or that we will be able to refinance our debt on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nThe lenders under the Senior Credit Facilities also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings. If we were unable to pay such amounts, the lenders under the Senior Credit Facilities could recover amounts owed to them by foreclosing against the collateral pledged to them. We have pledged a substantial portion of our assets to the lenders under the Senior Credit Facilities, including the equity of all of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries.\nIn addition, the degree to which we are leveraged as a result of the indebtedness incurred in connection with the acquisition of the CarePoint Business or otherwise could:\n\u2022\nmake us more vulnerable to general adverse economic, regulatory and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes and opportunities in the markets in which we compete;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to service our debt, reducing the availability of our cash flow and such proceeds to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes; or\n\u2022\nrestrict us from making strategic acquisitions or exploiting other business opportunities.\nWe may be unable to obtain a required modification of the Revolving Credit Facility if our Revolving Credit Facility usage exceeds certain thresholds.\nIf the PBM business continues to decline and if we are unable to offset this decline through the growth of our other business segments or otherwise improve our cash flow from operations and reduce our borrowing needs, the Revolving Credit Facility financial covenant that limits advances under the Revolving Credit Facility will become applicable to us. This covenant becomes applicable when Revolving Credit Facility usage exceeds certain thresholds. In such event, we would be required to seek modification of this financial covenant to better align with our expectations for the PBM business. There can be no assurance that the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility will grant our request for such modification, nor is there any assurance that the terms and conditions of such modification, if granted by the lenders, would be acceptable to us. If this covenant becomes applicable and we do not obtain the required modification of the covenant, we will not be in compliance with this covenant.\nDespite our substantial indebtedness, we may still incur significantly more debt. This could exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial leverage.\nWe may incur substantial additional indebtedness, including additional secured indebtedness, in the future, in connection with future acquisitions, strategic investments and strategic relationships. Although the Senior Credit Facilities and the indenture governing the 2021 Notes contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions and, under certain circumstances, debt incurred in compliance with these restrictions, including secured debt, could be substantial. The Senior Credit Facilities permit, among other things, credit borrowings of up to $475.0 million. Adding additional debt to current debt levels could exacerbate the leverage-related risks described above.\nTo service our indebtedness and other obligations, we will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control, and any failure to meet our debt obligations could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, including the Senior Credit Facilities and the 2021 Notes, and to fund working capital needs and planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. A significant reduction in our operating cash flows resulting from changes in economic conditions, changes in government reimbursement rates or methods, increased competition or other events beyond our control could increase the need for additional or alternative sources of liquidity and could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial statements, prospects and our ability to service our debt and other obligations.\nWe cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under the Senior Credit Facilities or otherwise in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness, including our indebtedness under the Senior Credit Facilities and 2021 Notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs. Our inability to pay our debts would require us to pursue one or more alternative strategies, such as selling assets, refinancing all or a portion of our indebtedness or selling equity capital. However, our alternative strategies may not be feasible at the time or may not provide adequate funds to allow us to pay our debts as they come due and fund our other liquidity needs. In addition, some alternative strategies are likely to require the prior consent of our senior secured lenders, which we may not be able to obtain.\nThe 2021 Notes are structurally subordinated to the liabilities of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the 2021 Notes.\nThe 2021 Notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by each of our current and future wholly owned domestic subsidiaries that are guarantors under our Senior Credit Facilities. The 2021 Notes are structurally subordinated to indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables, of any of our existing and future subsidiaries that are not guarantors of the 2021 Notes.\nThe indenture governing the 2021 Notes allows non-guarantor subsidiaries to incur certain additional indebtedness in the future. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of any of our non-guarantor subsidiaries, these non-guarantor subsidiaries will pay the holders of their debts, holders of their preferred equity interests and their trade creditors before they will be able to distribute any of their assets to us.\nA subsidiary guarantee could be voided if it constitutes a fraudulent transfer under U.S. bankruptcy or similar state law, which would prevent the lenders under the Senior Credit Facilities from relying on that subsidiary to satisfy claims.\nThe indebtedness outstanding under our Senior Credit Facilities is guaranteed by our domestic subsidiaries. The guarantees may be subject to review under U.S. federal bankruptcy law and comparable provisions of state fraudulent conveyance laws if a bankruptcy or another similar case or lawsuit is commenced by or on behalf of our or a guarantor subsidiary\u2019s unpaid creditors or another authorized party. Under these laws, if a court were to find that, at the time any guarantor subsidiary issued a guarantee of the indebtedness under the Senior Credit Facilities, either it issued the guarantee to delay, hinder or defraud present or future creditors or it received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for issuing the guarantee and at the time:\n\u2022\nit was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of issuing the guarantee;\n\u2022\nit was engaged, or about to engage, in a business or transaction for which its remaining unencumbered assets constituted unreasonably small capital to carry on its business;\n\u2022\nit intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay as they mature; or\n\u2022\nit was a defendant in an action for money damages, or had a judgment for money damages docketed against it if, in either case, after final judgment, the judgment is unsatisfied, then the court could void the obligations under the guarantee, or subordinate the guarantee of the indebtedness outstanding under the Senior Credit Facilities to other debt.\nWe cannot be sure as to the standard that a court would use to determine whether a guarantor subsidiary was solvent at the relevant time, or, regardless of the standard that the court uses, that the issuance of the guarantees would not be voided or that the guarantees would not be subordinated to other debt. If such a case were to occur, the guarantee could also be subject to the claim that, since the guarantee was incurred for our benefit, and only indirectly for the benefit of the guarantor subsidiary, the obligations of the applicable guarantor subsidiary were incurred for less than fair consideration. A court could thus void the obligations under the guarantee, subordinate the guarantee to the applicable guarantor subsidiary\u2019s other debt or take other action detrimental to the lenders under the Senior Credit Facilities. If a court were to void a guarantee, the lenders under the Senior Credit Facilities would no longer have a claim against the guarantor subsidiary. Sufficient funds to repay amounts outstanding under the Senior Credit Facilities may not be available from other sources, including the remaining guarantor subsidiaries, if any. In addition, the court might direct the lenders under the Senior Credit Facilities to repay any amounts already received from or that are attributable to the guarantor subsidiary.\nEach subsidiary guarantee contains a provision intended to limit the guarantor subsidiary\u2019s liability to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the incurrence of obligations under its subsidiary guarantee to be a fraudulent transfer. This provision may not be effective to protect the subsidiary guarantees from being voided under fraudulent transfer law.\nOur subsidiary guarantors may be unable to fulfill their obligations under their guarantees.\nThe ability of our subsidiary guarantors to make any required payments under their guarantees depends on our future operating performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic and other factors, many of which we cannot control. Such subsidiaries\u2019 businesses may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future and their anticipated growth in revenue and cash flow may not be realized, either or both of which could result in their being unable to honor their guarantees or to fund other liquidity needs. If such subsidiaries do not have enough money, they may be required to refinance all or part of their then-existing debt, sell assets or borrow more money. They may not be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on terms acceptable to them, or at all. In addition, the terms of existing or future debt agreements, including the Senior Credit Facilities, may restrict such subsidiaries from adopting any of these alternatives. The failure of our subsidiaries to generate sufficient cash flow or to achieve any of these alternatives could materially and adversely affect the ability of such subsidiaries to pay the amounts due under their guarantees, if any.", "PERMNO": 83883, "SIC": 8090, "TIC": "OPCH"}
