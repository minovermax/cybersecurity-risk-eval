{"cik": "851205", "company": "COGNEX CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-17", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A: RISK FACTORS\nThe risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently deem immaterial, also may become important factors that affect our company in the future. If any of these risks were to occur, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. This section includes or refers to certain forward-looking statements. We refer you to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on such forward-looking statements, appearing under the heading \"Forward-Looking Statements\" in Part II - Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to our Supply Chain\nThe failure of a key supplier to manufacture and deliver quality product in a timely manner could negatively affect customer satisfaction and our operating results.\nA significant portion of our products is presently manufactured by a third-party contractor located in Indonesia. This contract manufacturer has agreed to provide Cognex with termination notification periods and last-time-buy rights, if applicable. We rely on our contract manufacturers to provide quality product. We engage in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring the performance of our third-party manufacturers; however, we may not detect all product quality issues through these programs and processes.\nWe also rely on our contract manufacturers to meet delivery schedules. We have experienced, and may continue to experience, delays in the delivery of our products from our contract manufacturers due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or other factors. Although our primary contract manufacturer has the ability to shift production to plants in other regions when operations in its Indonesia plant are disrupted, production and test equipment located at the Indonesia plant that is unique to the manufacture of Cognex products creates practical challenges to doing so in a timely manner. Furthermore, this contract manufacturer sources components for our products and has experienced, and may continue to experience, disruptions in the supply of these components. These challenges in obtaining components and maintaining production have resulted in delays, and may continue to result in delays, in meeting our delivery schedules that, as a result, delay deliveries to our customers past their requested delivery date. These delays of customer orders could result in delayed revenue recognition which could impact our operating results in a particular quarter. In addition, delays of customer orders could negatively impact customer satisfaction and, in turn, cause loss of sales, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur inability to obtain components for our products could adversely affect our operating results.\nCertain key electronic and mechanical components, such as integrated circuit chips, are fundamental to the design of Cognex products. Due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and other factors, we have experienced, and may continue to experience, disruptions to the supply of components for our products that have resulted, and may continue to result, in higher purchase costs, delivery costs, and manufacturing delays.\nThe Company sources components from preferred vendors that are selected based on price and performance considerations. In the event of a supply disruption from a preferred vendor, these components may typically be purchased from alternative vendors, which may result in higher purchase costs and manufacturing delays based on the time required to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. Certain of the Company\u2019s products utilize components that are available from only one source. If we are unable to secure adequate supply from these sources, we may have to redesign our products, which may lead to higher costs, delays in manufacturing, and possible loss of sales.\nAlthough we are taking certain actions to mitigate supply risk and the Company has entered into agreements, including in broker markets, for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, such as purchase prices, or at all. Component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier, further limiting the Company\u2019s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on reasonable terms, or at all. Therefore, the Company remains subject to risks of supply shortages and price increases that can adversely affect its business and operating results.\nOur failure to effectively manage product transitions or accurately forecast customer demand could result in excess or obsolete inventory and resulting charges.\nBecause the market for our products is characterized by rapid technological changes, we frequently introduce new products with improved ease-of-use, improved hardware performance, additional software features and functionality, or lower cost that may replace existing products. Among the risks associated with the introduction of new products are difficulty predicting customer demand and effectively managing inventory levels to ensure adequate supply of the new product and avoid excess supply of the legacy product.\nTable of Content\nWe may strategically enter into non-cancelable commitments with vendors to purchase materials for our products in advance of demand to address concerns about the availability of future supplies, build safety stock to help ensure customer shipments are not delayed should we experience higher than anticipated demand for materials with long lead times, or take advantage of favorable pricing. Disruptions in both the supply of materials for our products and delivery of products from our contract manufacturers, such as those caused by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or other factors, have resulted, and may continue to result, in the Company purchasing a significant amount of inventory in response to these disruptions and in advance of demand. These measures to purchase inventory may expose us to an increased risk of excess or obsolete inventory and resulting charges if actual demand is lower than anticipated.\nIf components purchased by our primary contract manufacturer have not been consumed in the production of our finished goods within a certain period of time, we have been required, and may continue to be required, to purchase these components from our contract manufacturer and later sell them back when they are needed to meet our demand. While we typically expect these components to be consumed in the production of our finished goods, this arrangement may expose us to an increased risk of excess or obsolete inventory and resulting charges.\nIn 2020, deteriorating global economic conditions from the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in lower projected sales of excess inventories, for which the company recorded provisions totaling $7,718,000 in the second quarter. Our failure to effectively manage product transitions or accurately forecast customer demand, in terms of both volume and configuration, has led to, and may again in the future lead to, an increased risk of excess or obsolete inventory and resulting charges.\nDisruptions to one of our distribution centers could adversely affect our operating results.\nThe Company ships finished products for customers located in the Americas from its Natick, Massachusetts distribution center, and finished products for customers located outside of the Americas from its Cork, Ireland distribution center. Due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has experienced, and may continue to experience, labor shortages and working restrictions due to factors such as health and safety concerns or governmental regulations. Although we have the ability to shift operations from one distribution center to another, there are practical challenges to doing so in a timely, cost-effective manner, and we may experience delays in shipping customer orders. These delays could negatively impact customer satisfaction and, in turn, cause loss of sales, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur products may contain design or manufacturing defects, which could result in reduced demand, significant delays, or substantial costs.\nIf flaws in either the design or manufacture of our products were to occur, we could experience a rate of failure in our products that could result in significant delays in shipment and material repair or replacement costs. Our release-to-market process may not be robust enough to detect significant design flaws or software bugs. While we engage in product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers and contract manufacturers, these actions may not be sufficient to avoid a product failure rate that results in:\n\u2022substantial delays in shipment,\n\u2022significant repair or replacement costs,\n\u2022product liability claims or lawsuits, particularly in connection with life sciences customers or other high-risk end-user industries, or\n\u2022potential damage to our reputation.\nAny of these results could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may impact our business is uncertain and it could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a significant impact around the world, prompting governments and businesses to take certain measures in response, such as the imposition of travel restrictions, temporary closures of businesses, quarantine and shelter-in-place orders, and adoption of remote working. COVID-19 continues to impact global economic activity and create macroeconomic uncertainty.\nWe continue to face several risks and uncertainties related to the impact of COVID-19 on our business. It is difficult for us to quantify the duration and severity of this impact due to many factors beyond our control and knowledge, including the timing, extent, trajectory, and duration of the pandemic, the emergence of new variants, the\nTable of Content\ndevelopment, availability, distribution and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments, the imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy. These risks and uncertainties include, among others:\n\u2022our customers may delay or cancel orders for our products,\n\u2022customer facilities may be shut down for extended periods of time, resulting in our inability to deliver products, perform on-site services, or make on-site sales visits,\n\u2022our customers may not have sufficient cash flow or access to financing to purchase our products,\n\u2022our customers may not pay us within agreed upon terms or may default on their payments altogether,\n\u2022our contract manufacturers may continue to experience interruptions that result in delivery delays and higher costs for our products,\n\u2022our vendors may continue to be unable to fulfill their delivery obligations to us within acceptable lead times for extended periods of time, which may force us to seek alternative sources of supply at higher costs or redesign or products,\n\u2022lower demand for our products may result in charges for excess and obsolete inventory if we are unable to sell inventory that is either already on hand or committed to purchase,\n\u2022our distribution centers in Natick, Massachusetts and Cork, Ireland may have difficulty staffing employees and contractors, be forced to operate with a significantly reduced workforce, or be forced to shut down altogether due to government regulations or health concerns,\n\u2022our online sales and marketing efforts may be less effective than face-to-face activities, resulting in fewer new customers and lower sales from new products,\n\u2022challenges involved in remote working may delay certain of our new product introductions,\n\u2022lower cash flows may result in impairment charges for acquired intangible assets,\n\u2022our investment portfolio of debt securities may be exposed to material credit losses, and\n\u2022a decline in our stock price may make stock-based awards a less attractive form of compensation and a less attractive form of retention for our employees.\nThese risks and uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on the continuity of our business, results of operations, and financial condition. This situation is continuously changing and additional impacts on our business may arise of which we are not currently aware.\nRisks Related to Revenue Concentrations\nThe loss of, or significant curtailment of purchases by, large customers could have an adverse effect on our business.\nIn 2021, we had a large customer in the logistics industry that represented approximately 17% of our total revenue. Large customers may divert management\u2019s attention from other operational matters and pull resources from other areas of the business, resulting in potential loss of sales from other customers. In addition, large customers may receive preferred pricing and a higher level of support, which may lower our gross margin percentage. Furthermore, in certain instances due to long supplier lead times, we may purchase inventory in advance of receipt of a customer purchase order, which exposes us to an increased risk of excess or obsolete inventory and resulting charges. The loss of, or curtailment of purchases by, any one or more of our large customers could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nRisks Related to Information Technology and Intellectual Property\nInformation security breaches may adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on our information technology systems, including third-party services, to effectively run our business. We may be subject to information security failures or breaches caused by hacking, malicious software, acts of vandalism or terrorism, or other events. Our security measures or those of our third-party service providers may not detect or prevent such breaches. Any such compromise to our information security could result in theft of our intellectual property, including software source code, a misappropriation of our cash or other assets, an interruption in our operations, the unauthorized publication of our confidential business or proprietary information, the unauthorized release of customer, vendor, or employee data, and the exposure to litigation or regulatory penalties, any of which could harm our business and operating results. We have experienced cybersecurity incidents in the\nTable of Content\npast; however, to date, these incidents have not had a material impact on our operations or financial results; however, future cybersecurity incidents could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, or operating results.\nIf we fail to successfully protect our intellectual property, our competitive position and operating results could suffer.\nWe rely on our proprietary software technology and hardware designs, as well as the technical expertise, creativity, and knowledge of our personnel to maintain our position as a leading provider of machine vision products. Software piracy and reverse engineering may result in counterfeit products that are misrepresented in the market as Cognex products or pirated products that contain stolen technology such as software. Although we use a variety of methods to protect our intellectual property, we rely most heavily on patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret protection, as well as non-disclosure agreements with customers, suppliers, employees, and consultants. We also attempt to protect our intellectual property by restricting access to our proprietary information by a combination of technical and internal security measures. These measures, however, may not be adequate to:\n\u2022protect our proprietary technology,\n\u2022protect our patents from challenge, invalidation, or circumvention, or\n\u2022ensure that our intellectual property will provide us with competitive advantages.\nOur pending and future patent applications may not issue as patents or, if issued, may not issue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection or any competitive advantage. Even if issued, existing or future patents may be challenged, narrowed, invalidated, or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from developing and marketing similar products, increase costs, or limit the length of patent protection we may have for our products. Furthermore, other companies may design around technologies we have patented, licensed, or developed. Moreover, changes in patent laws or their interpretation in the United States and other countries could also diminish the value of our intellectual property or narrow the scope of our patent protection. In addition, the legal systems of certain countries do not favor the aggressive enforcement of patents, and the laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. As a result, our patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar to ours. Any of these adverse circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nRisks Related to Execution of our Business Strategy\nIf we fail to attract and retain key talent and maintain our unique corporate culture, our business and operating results could suffer.\nTo support our growth and execute on our operating plans and strategic initiatives, we must effectively attract, train, develop, motivate, and retain skilled employees, while maintaining our unique corporate culture. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many of our employees have worked remotely at times due to health and safety concerns or to comply with governmental regulations, with the primary exception of our distribution center employees who have remained on-site in shifts throughout the pandemic to deliver products to our customers. While we have been able to effectively conduct most business activities in this manner, these conditions have made it more challenging to maintain our collaborative corporate culture. When regulatory and health conditions have allowed, we have returned to a more collaborative, largely on-site work environment. Our longer-term intention is to have a hybrid work model, where our employees work on-site in a team environment the majority of the time. If we are unsuccessful in bringing our employees back into the office when safe to do so for a hybrid work model, or our employees choose to leave the company altogether for more remote work flexibility or higher compensation, the company's business and ability to execute its plans could be adversely affected in a material way.\nWe use stock options and restricted stock units (RSUs) as a key component of compensation for our more senior employees in order to align employee interests with the interests of our shareholders, provide competitive compensation packages, and encourage employee retention. Our stock price volatility may cause periods of time during which option exercise prices might be less than the sale price of our common stock or the value of RSUs might be less competitive, which may lessen the retentive attributes of these awards. We are limited as to the number of stock options and RSUs that we may grant under our stock plans, and we are unsure how effective different stock-based awards with different vesting schedules will be to retain key talent. Accordingly, we may find it difficult to attract, retain, and motivate employees, and any such difficulties could materially adversely affect our business.\nTable of Content\nOur failure to introduce new products in a successful and timely manner could result in the loss of our market share and a decrease in our revenues and profits.\nThe market for our products is characterized by rapidly changing technology. Accordingly, we believe that our future success will depend on our ability to accelerate time-to-market for new products with improved functionality, ease-of-use, performance, and price. There can be no assurance that we will be able to introduce new products in accordance with scheduled release dates or that new products will achieve market acceptance. Our inability to keep pace with the rapid rate of technological change in the high-technology marketplace could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nProduct development is often a complex, time-consuming, and costly process involving significant investment in research and development with no assurance of return on investment. Our strong balance sheet allows us to continue to make significant investments in research, development, and marketing for new products and technologies. Research is by its nature speculative, and the ultimate commercial success of a product depends on various factors, many of which are not under our control. We may not achieve significant revenue from new product investments for a number of years, if at all. Moreover, new products, if introduced, may not generate the gross margins that we have experienced historically.\nOur failure to properly manage the distribution of our products and services could result in the loss of revenues and profits.\nWe utilize a direct sales force, as well as a network of distribution and integration partners, to sell our products and services. Successfully managing the interaction of our direct and indirect sales channels to reach various potential customers for our products and services is a complex process. In addition, our reliance on indirect selling methods may reduce visibility to demand and pricing issues.\nTo support the expansion of our business internationally, we may decide to make changes to our operating structure in other countries when we believe these changes will make us more competitive by offering faster delivery, importation services, and/or local currency sales. These new operating models may require changes in legal structures, business systems, and business processes that may result in significant business disruption and negatively impact our customers\u2019 experience, resulting in loss of sales. Furthermore, as we assume more responsibility for the importation of our products into other countries, we face higher compliance risk to adhering to local regulatory and trade requirements. Finally, the local stocking of finished products in countries outside of our primary distribution centers may result in higher costs and increased risk of excess or obsolete inventory associated with maintaining the appropriate level and mix of stock in multiple inventory locations, resulting in lower gross margins.\nOur go-to-market strategy has distinct risks and costs, and therefore, our failure to implement the most advantageous balance in the sales and operating model for our products and services could adversely affect our revenue and profitability.\nIncreased competition may result in decreased demand or prices for our products and services.\nThe machine vision market is highly fragmented and competitive. Our competitors include other vendors of machine vision systems, controllers, and components; manufacturers of image processing systems, sensors, and components; and system integrators. We also compete with internal engineering departments of current or prospective customers, as well as open-source tools available for free by various companies. In recent years, we have encountered increased competition from low-cost vision providers in China, as well as from large technology companies that may offer free open-source solutions. Any of these competitors may have greater financial and other resources than we do, or develop more compelling technological innovations. We may not be able to compete successfully in the future and our investments in research and development, sales and marketing, and support activities may be insufficient to enable us to maintain our competitive advantage. In addition, competitive pressures could lead to price erosion that could have a material adverse effect on our gross margins and operating results.\nImplementation of our acquisition strategy may not be successful, which could affect our ability to increase our revenue or profitability and may otherwise adversely affect our business.\nWe have acquired, and may continue to acquire, new businesses and technologies. These acquisitions may involve significant risks and uncertainties, which could include, among others:\n\u2022the diversion of management's attention from other operational matters,\n\u2022difficulties or delays integrating personnel, operations, technologies, products, and systems of the acquired business, particularly in locations far from the company's headquarters,\n\u2022the inability to realize expected synergies or other benefits resulting from the acquisition,\nTable of Content\n\u2022the failure to retain key talent,\n\u2022the impairment of acquired intangible assets resulting from lower-than-expected cash flows from the acquired assets,\n\u2022acquisition-related charges, which could adversely impact operating results and cash flows in any given period, and the impact may be substantially different from period to period,\n\u2022difficulties with closing a transaction due to regulatory approvals, required consents, litigation, or other challenges, which could increase costs and prevent the acquisition from being completed within the expected timeframe, or from being completed at all,\n\u2022the inability to protect and secure acquired intellectual property or confidential information,\n\u2022difficulties or delays completing the development of acquired in-process technology,\n\u2022the failure to retain key customers, and\n\u2022the failure to achieve projected sales of acquired products.\nAcquisitions are inherently risky and the inability to effectively manage these risks could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nBusiness system disruptions may adversely affect our business.\nThe Company is making significant investments in business systems related to our sales processes, including systems to help our sales team more efficiently manage customer relationships and sales opportunities. Implementing new business systems requires a significant investment of time and money, and may divert management\u2019s attention from other operational matters. The implementation of new business systems and changes to associated business processes, particularly those that are customer-facing, may result in significant business disruption and negatively impact our customers\u2019 experience, resulting in loss of sales. The Company intends to continue to make IT-related investments to improve its management information systems and support the expansion of our business internationally. Any disruption occurring with our business systems may have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nRisks Related to Financial Matters\nWe are at risk for impairment charges with respect to our investments or acquired intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $721 million of debt securities in our investment portfolio. These debt securities are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, included in shareholders\u2019 equity as other comprehensive income (loss) since these securities are designated as available-for-sale securities. As of December 31, 2021, our portfolio of debt securities had a net unrealized loss of $3,902,000. Included in this net loss, were gross unrealized losses totaling $4,971,000, of which $4,896,000 were in a loss position for less than twelve months and $75,000 were in a loss position for greater than twelve months. Management monitors its debt securities that are in an unrealized loss position to determine whether a loss exists related to the credit quality of the issuer that would be reported in current operations. It is our policy to invest in investment-grade debt securities that minimize our exposure to credit losses. No credit losses were recorded in 2021.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $12 million in acquired intangible assets, consisting primarily of acquired technologies and customer relationships. These assets are susceptible to changes in fair value due to a decrease in the historical or projected cash flows from the use of these assets, which may be negatively impacted by economic trends. In 2020, deteriorating global economic conditions from the COVID-19 pandemic triggered a review of long-lived assets for potential impairment, which resulted in intangible asset impairment charges totaling $19,571,000. A further decline in the cash flows generated by these or other intangible assets may result in future impairment charges.\nIf we determine that any of these investments or intangible assets are impaired, we would be required to take a related charge to earnings that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe may have additional tax liabilities and our effective tax rate may increase or fluctuate, which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nAs a multinational corporation, we are subject to income taxes, as well as non-income based taxes, in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our effective income tax rate is dependent on the geographic distribution of our worldwide earnings or losses and the tax laws and regulations in each geographic region in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income and other taxes. The application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation, judgment, and uncertainty, and\nTable of Content\ntax laws themselves are subject to change. For example, many countries have recently adopted, or are considering the adoption of, revisions to their respective tax laws based on the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (\u201cOECD\u201d)\u2019s Inclusive Framework, which could impact our tax liability due to our organizational structure and significant operations outside of the United States. Furthermore, we are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities and may be assessed additional taxes, penalties, fees, or interest, which could have an adverse effect on our financial position, liquidity, or results of operations.\nAlthough we believe our tax positions are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits or any related litigation could be different from what is reflected in our financial statements and could have a material adverse effect on our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period in which the determination is made.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and the use of derivative instruments to hedge these exposures could adversely affect our reported results, liquidity, and competitive position.\nWe face exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, as a significant portion of our revenues, expenses, assets, and liabilities are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of our subsidiaries or the reporting currency of our company, which is the U.S. Dollar. In certain instances, we utilize forward contracts to hedge against foreign currency fluctuations. These contracts are used to minimize foreign currency gains or losses, as the gains or losses on the derivative are intended to offset the losses or gains on the underlying exposure. We do not engage in foreign currency speculation. If the counterparty to any of our hedging arrangements experiences financial difficulties, or is otherwise unable to honor the terms of the contract, we may experience material losses.\nThe success of our foreign currency risk management program depends on forecasts of transaction activity denominated in various currencies. To the extent that these forecasts are overstated or understated during periods of currency volatility, we could experience unanticipated foreign currency gains or losses that could have a material impact on our results of operations. In addition, our failure to identify new exposures and hedge them in an effective manner may result in material foreign currency gains or losses. Furthermore, our ability to hedge the Chinese Renminbi is limited, which has resulted in unhedged exposures. To date, foreign currency gains and losses related to the Chinese Renminbi have been immaterial to our total results; however, further fluctuations in this currency may result in material foreign currency gains or losses in the future.\nIn addition to the U.S. Dollar, a significant portion of our revenues and expenses are denominated in the Euro and Chinese Renminbi, and to a lesser extent the Japanese Yen, Korean Won, and Mexican Peso. We estimate that approximately 49% of our sales in 2021 were invoiced in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, and we expect sales denominated in foreign currencies to continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenue. While we also have expenses denominated in these same foreign currencies, the impact on revenues has historically been, and is expected to continue to be, greater than the offsetting impact on expenses. Therefore, in times when the U.S. Dollar strengthens in relation to these foreign currencies, we would expect to report a net decrease in operating income. Conversely, in times when the U.S. Dollar weakens in relation to these foreign currencies, we would expect to report a net increase in operating income. Thus, changes in the relative strength of the U.S. Dollar may have a material impact on our operating results.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nUnfavorable global economic conditions may negatively impact our operating results.\nOur revenue levels are impacted by global economic conditions, as we have a significant business presence in many countries throughout the world. Unfavorable economic conditions, such as inflation, slower growth or recession, higher interest rates, and tighter credit, may cause industrial companies to delay or reduce spending for automation projects, including those with machine vision, amid weaker general manufacturing confidence and heightened uncertainty around global trade. When global economic conditions are unfavorable, our revenue and our ability to generate operating profits could be materially adversely affected.\nAs a result of global economic conditions, our business is subject to the following risks, among others:\n\u2022our customers may not have sufficient cash flow or access to financing to purchase our products,\n\u2022our customers may not pay us within agreed upon terms or may default on their payments altogether,\n\u2022our vendors may be unable to fulfill their delivery obligations to us in a timely manner,\n\u2022lower demand for our products may result in charges for excess and obsolete inventory if we are unable to sell inventory that is either already on hand or committed to purchase,\n\u2022lower cash flows may result in impairment charges for acquired intangible assets or goodwill,\nTable of Content\n\u2022a decline in our stock price may make stock-based awards a less attractive form of compensation and a less effective form of retention for our employees, and\n\u2022the trading price of our common stock may be volatile.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company had approximately $907 million in cash and investments. In addition, Cognex has no long-term debt. We believe that our strong cash position puts us in a relatively good position to weather economic downturns. Nevertheless, our operating results have been materially adversely affected in the past, and could be materially adversely affected in the future, as a result of unfavorable economic conditions and reduced capital spending by manufacturers worldwide.\nA natural disaster, widespread public health issue, or man-made disaster could result in business disruptions that may adversely affect our business and operating results.\nOur business, and the businesses of our customers, suppliers, and third-party service providers, could be disrupted by natural disasters, public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics, man-made disasters, such as cyber-attacks and terrorism, or other events outside of our control. Certain of the Company\u2019s business operations, such as our third-party contractor manufacturer in Indonesia, are in locations that may be more prone to natural disasters, and global climate change may result in certain types of natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. Following a business disruption, the Company could be subject to production downtimes, operational delays, substantial recovery time, significant expenditures to resume operations, the diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, or loss of business, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, operating results, or financial condition. Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the supply of certain components and manufacture of our products, a business disruption affecting such sources would worsen any adverse consequences to the Company.\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses that may arise. The impact of any such business disruption is difficult to predict.\nEconomic, political, and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nIn 2021, approximately 62% of our revenue was derived from customers located outside of the United States. We anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue. In addition, we source components from suppliers located outside of the United States, including China, and utilize third-party contract manufacturers, primarily located in Indonesia, to assemble certain of our products. We intend to continue to expand our sales and operations outside of the United States and expand our presence in international emerging markets. As a result, our business is subject to the risks inherent in international sales and operations, including, among other things:\n\u2022various regulatory and statutory requirements,\n\u2022difficulties in injecting and repatriating cash,\n\u2022export and import restrictions,\n\u2022trade tariffs,\n\u2022transportation delays,\n\u2022product certification requirements,\n\u2022employment regulations and local labor conditions,\n\u2022difficulties in staffing and managing foreign sales operations,\n\u2022corruption,\n\u2022instability in economic or political conditions,\n\u2022political or trade sanctions,\n\u2022difficulties protecting intellectual property,\n\u2022business systems connectivity issues, and\n\u2022potentially adverse tax consequences.\nAny of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. In recent years, trade tariffs imposed by the United States on certain components imported from Chinese suppliers resulted in higher costs for\nTable of Content\nour products, which, to date, have been immaterial to our total cost of goods. However, cost increases as a result of these or other trade tariffs could be material in the future.\nTrade tariffs have also had an indirect impact on the economic climate in China, which in turn, has had a negative impact on the Company's revenue from customers based in China who see risk in doing business with a U.S. company. In addition to trade tariffs, United States export controls that place restrictions on the exportation of our products or a subset of our products, including applicable regulations promulgated by the U.S. Commerce Department\u2019s Bureau of Industry and Security, have had a negative impact on our revenue from customers based in China. To date, the impact of these restrictions has been immaterial to our total revenue; however, further or continued restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our operating results in the future.\nAdditionally, we are subject to applicable anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, and similar anti-corruption and anti-kickback laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate. These laws generally prohibit offering, promising, giving, or authorizing others to provide anything of value, either directly or indirectly, to a government official or private party in order to influence official action or otherwise gain an unfair business advantage, such as to obtain or retain business.
