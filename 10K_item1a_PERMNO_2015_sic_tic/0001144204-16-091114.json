RISK FACTORS.\nAny investment in the Company\u2019s securities involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with the information contained elsewhere in this Annual Report, before you make a decision to invest in the Company. The Company\u2019s business, financial conditions and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by many risk factors. Because of these risk factors, actual results might differ significantly from those projected in any forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, among others, the following:\nRISKS RELATED TO THE COMPANY\u2019S BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY\nThe cyclical nature of automotive production and sales could result in a reduction in automotive sales, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s business relies on automotive vehicle production and sales by its customers, which are highly cyclical and depend on general economic conditions and other factors, including consumer spending and preferences and the price and availability of gasoline. They also can be affected by labor relations issues, regulatory requirements and other factors. In the last two years, the price of automobiles in China has generally declined. Additionally, the volume of automotive production in China has fluctuated from year to year, which gives rise to fluctuations in the demand for the Company\u2019s products. Therefore, any significant economic decline could result in a reduction in automotive production and sales by the Company\u2019s customers and could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations. Moreover, if the prices of automobiles keep declining, the selling price of automotive parts also would decrease, which would result in lower revenues and profitability.\nIncreasing costs for manufactured components and raw materials may adversely affect the Company\u2019s profitability.\nThe Company uses a broad range of manufactured components and raw materials in its products, including castings, electronic components, finished sub-components, molded plastic parts, fabricated metal, aluminum and steel and resins. Because it may be difficult to pass increased prices for these items on to the Company\u2019s customers, a significant increase in the prices of the Company\u2019s components and materials could materially increase the Company\u2019s operating costs and adversely affect its profit margins and profitability.\nBecause the Company is a holding company with substantially all of its operations conducted through its subsidiaries, its performance will be affected by the performance of its subsidiaries.\nThe Company almost has no operations independent of those of Genesis and its subsidiaries, and the Company\u2019s principal assets are its investments in Genesis and its subsidiaries and affiliates. As a result, the Company is dependent upon the performance of Genesis and its subsidiaries and will be subject to the financial, business and other factors affecting Genesis as well as general economic and financial conditions. As substantially all of the Company\u2019s operations are and will be conducted through its subsidiaries, the Company will be dependent on the cash flow of its subsidiaries to meet its obligations.\nBecause virtually all of the Company\u2019s assets are and will be held by operating subsidiaries, the claims of the Company\u2019s stockholders will be structurally subordinate to all existing and future liabilities and obligations, and trade payables of such subsidiaries. In the event of the Company\u2019s bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization, its assets and those of its subsidiaries will be available to satisfy the claims of the Company\u2019s stockholders only after all of its and its subsidiaries\u2019 liabilities and obligations have been paid in full.\nWith the automobile parts markets being highly competitive and many of the Company\u2019s competitors having greater resources than it does, the Company may not be able to compete successfully.\nThe automobile parts industry is a highly competitive business. The Company\u2019s customers consider criteria including:\n\u00b7 quality;\n\u00b7 price/cost competitiveness;\n\u00b7 system and product performance;\n\u00b7 reliability and timeliness of delivery;\n\u00b7 new product and technology development capability;\n\u00b7 excellence and flexibility in operations;\n\u00b7 degree of global and local presence;\n\u00b7 effectiveness of customer service; and\n\u00b7 overall management capability.\nThe Company\u2019s competitors include independent suppliers of parts, as well as suppliers formed by spin-offs from the Company\u2019s customers, who are becoming more aggressive in selling parts to other vehicle manufacturers. Depending on the particular product, the number of the Company\u2019s competitors varies significantly. Many of the Company\u2019s competitors have substantially greater revenues and financial resources than it does, as well as stronger brand names, consumer recognition, business relationships with vehicle manufacturers, and geographic presence than it has. The Company may not be able to compete favorably and increased competition may substantially harm its business, business prospects and results of operations.\nInternationally, the Company faces different market dynamics and competition. The Company may not be as successful as its competitors in generating revenues in international markets due to the lack of recognition of its products or other factors. Developing product recognition overseas is expensive and time-consuming and the Company\u2019s international expansion efforts may be more costly and less profitable than it expects. If the Company is not successful in its target markets, its sales could decline, its margins could be negatively impacted and it could lose market share, any of which could materially harm the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and profitability.\nPricing pressure by automobile manufacturers on their suppliers may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nRecently, pricing pressure from automobile manufacturers has been prevalent in the automotive parts industry in China. Virtually all vehicle manufacturers seek price reductions each year. Although the Company has tried to reduce costs and resist price reductions, these reductions have impacted the Company\u2019s sales and profit margins. If the Company cannot offset continued price reductions through improved operating efficiencies and reduced expenditures, price reductions will have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s business, revenues and profitability would be materially and adversely affected if it loses any of its large customers.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, approximately 12.8%, 9.4%, 8.0% and 8.0% of the Company\u2019s sales were to Fiat Chrysler North America, JAC, Dongfeng Auto Group Co., Ltd., and Chongqing Changan Automobile Co., Ltd., the Company\u2019s four largest customers in 2015, respectively. In total, these four largest customers accounted for 38.2% of total sales in 2015. For the year ended December 31, 2014, approximately 11.5%, 8.6%, 8.0% and 7.6% of the Company\u2019s sales were to Fiat Chrysler North America, Dongfeng Auto Group Co., Ltd., Beijing Henglong and SAIC Motor, the Company\u2019s four largest customers in 2014, respectively. In total, these four largest customers accounted for 35.7% of total sales in 2014. The loss of, or significant reduction in purchases by, one or more of these major customers could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company may not be able to collect receivables incurred by customers.\nAlthough the Company currently sells its products on credit, the Company\u2019s ability to receive payment for its products depends on the continued creditworthiness of its customers. The Company\u2019s customer base may change if its sales increase because of the Company\u2019s expanded capacity. If the Company is not able to collect its receivables, its profitability will be adversely affected.\nThe Company may be subject to product liability and warranty and recall claims, which may increase the costs of doing business and adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and liquidity.\nThe Company may be exposed to product liability and warranty claims if its products actually or allegedly fail to perform as expected or the use of its products results, or is alleged to result, in bodily injury and/or property damage. The Company started to pay some of its customers\u2019 increased after-sales service expenses due to consumer rights protection policies of \u201crecall\u201d issued by the Chinese government in 2004, such as the recalling flawed vehicles policy. Beginning in 2004, automobile manufacturers unilaterally required their suppliers to pay a \u201c3-R Guarantees\u201d service charge for repair, replacement and refund in an amount of about 2%-6% of the total amount of parts supplied. Accordingly, the Company has experienced and will continue to experience higher after sales service expenses. Product liability, warranty and recall costs may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition.\nThe Company is subject to environmental and safety regulations, which may increase the Company\u2019s compliance costs and may adversely affect its results of operations.\nThe Company is subject to the requirements of environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations in China. The Company cannot provide assurance that it has been or will be at all times in full compliance with all of these requirements, or that it will not incur material costs or liabilities in connection with these requirements. Additionally, these regulations may change in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. The capital requirements and other expenditures that may be necessary to comply with environmental requirements could increase and become a material expense of doing business.\nNon-performance by the Company\u2019s suppliers may adversely affect its operations by delaying delivery or causing delivery failures, which may negatively affect demand, sales and profitability.\nThe Company purchases various types of equipment, raw materials and manufactured component parts from its suppliers. The Company would be materially and adversely affected by the failure of its suppliers to perform as expected. The Company could experience delivery delays or failures caused by production issues or delivery of non-conforming products if its suppliers fail to perform, and it also faces these risks in the event any of its suppliers becomes insolvent or bankrupt.\nThe Company\u2019s business and growth may suffer if it fails to attract and retain key personnel.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to operate its business and implement its strategies effectively depends on the efforts of its executive officers and other key employees. The Company depends on the continued contributions of its senior management and other key personnel. The Company\u2019s future success also depends on its ability to identify, attract and retain highly skilled technical staff, particularly engineers and other employees with mechanics and electronics expertise, and managerial, finance and marketing personnel. The Company does not maintain a key person life insurance policy on Mr. Hanlin Chen or Mr. Qizhou Wu. The loss of the services of any of the Company\u2019s key employees or the failure to attract or retain other qualified personnel could substantially harm the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company\u2019s management controls approximately 62.6 % of its outstanding common stock and may have conflicts of interest with the Company\u2019s minority stockholders.\nAs of December 31, 2015, members of the Company\u2019s management beneficially own approximately 62.6 % of the outstanding shares of the Company\u2019s common stock. As a result, except for the related party transactions that require approval of the audit committee of the board of directors of the Company, these majority stockholders have control over decisions to enter into any corporate transaction, which could result in the approval of transactions that might not maximize overall stockholders\u2019 value. Additionally, these stockholders control the election of members of the Company\u2019s board, have the ability to appoint new members to the Company\u2019s management team and control the outcome of matters submitted to a vote of the holders of the Company\u2019s common stock. The interests of these majority stockholders may at times conflict with the interests of the Company\u2019s other stockholders. The Company regularly engages in transactions with entities controlled by one or more of its officers and directors, including those controlled by Mr. Hanlin Chen, the chairman of the board of directors of the Company and its controlling stockholder.\nThere is a limited public float of the Company\u2019s common stock, which can result in the Company\u2019s stock price being volatile and prevent the realization of a profit on resale of the Company\u2019s common stock or derivative securities.\nThere is a limited public float of the Company\u2019s common stock. As of December 31, 2015, approximately 37.4 % of the Company\u2019s outstanding common stock is considered part of the public float. The term \u201cpublic float\u201d refers to shares freely and actively tradable on the NASDAQ Capital Market and not owned by officers, directors or affiliates, as such term is defined under the Securities Act. As a result of the limited public float and the limited trading volume on some days, the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock can be volatile, and relatively small changes in the demand for or supply of the Company\u2019s common stock can have a disproportionate effect on the market price for its common stock. This stock price volatility could prevent a security holder seeking to sell the Company\u2019s common stock or derivative securities from being able to sell them at or above the price at which the stock or derivative securities were bought, or at a price which a fully liquid market would report.\nThe Company is subject to penny stock regulations and restrictions.\nThe SEC has adopted regulations which generally define so-called \u201cpenny stock\u201d as an equity security that has a market price less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exemptions. As of December 31, 2015, the closing price for the Company\u2019s common stock was $ 4.58. If the Company\u2019s stock is a \u201cpenny stock\u201d, it may become subject to Rule 15g-9 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the \u201cPenny Stock Rule.\u201d This rule imposes additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers that sell such securities to persons other than established customers and \u201caccredited investors,\u201d generally, individuals with a net worth in excess of $1.0 million or annual incomes exceeding $0.2 million, or $0.3 million together with their spouses. For transactions covered by Rule 15g-9, a broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and have received the purchaser\u2019s written consent to the transaction prior to sale. As a result, this rule may affect the ability of broker-dealers to sell the Company\u2019s securities and may affect the ability of purchasers to sell any of the Company\u2019s securities in the secondary market.\nFor any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require delivery, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, of a disclosure schedule prepared by the SEC relating to the penny stock market. Disclosure also is required to be made about sales commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities. Finally, monthly statements are required to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stock.\nThere can be no assurance that the Company\u2019s common stock will qualify for exemption from the Penny Stock Rule. In any event, even if the Company\u2019s common stock were exempt from the Penny Stock Rule, the Company would remain subject to Section 15(b)(6) of the Exchange Act, which gives the SEC the authority to restrict any person from participating in a distribution of penny stock if the SEC finds that such a restriction would be in the public interest.\nProvisions in the Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the General Corporation Law of Delaware may discourage a takeover attempt.\nProvisions in the Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the General Corporation Law of Delaware, the state in which it is organized, could make it difficult for a third party to acquire the Company, even if doing so might be beneficial to the Company\u2019s stockholders. Provisions of the Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation and bylaws impose various procedural and other requirements, which could make it difficult for stockholders to effect certain corporate actions and possibly prevent transactions that would maximize stockholders\u2019 value.\nFailure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and the trading price of its shares.\nThe Company is subject to reporting obligations under the U.S. securities laws. The Securities and Exchange Commission, the \u201cSEC,\u201d as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, has adopted rules requiring public companies to include a report of management in its annual report that contains an assessment by management of the effectiveness of such company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting.\nIf the Company fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal controls in the future, it will not be able to ensure that it can conclude on an ongoing basis that it has effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Moreover, effective internal controls are necessary for the Company to produce reliable financial reports and are important to help prevent fraud. Any failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in the loss of investor confidence in the reliability of the Company\u2019s financial statements, which in turn could harm its business and negatively impact the trading price of its common stock. Furthermore, the Company may need to incur additional costs and use additional management and other resources in an effort to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and other requirements going forward.\nThe Company generally does not pay cash dividends on its common stock.\nAlthough the Company announced a special cash dividend of $0.18 per common share to the Company\u2019s shareholders of record as of the close of business on June 26, 2014, it does not anticipate paying any other cash dividends in the foreseeable future. The Company currently intends to retain future earnings, if any, to finance operations and the expansion of its business. Any future determination to pay cash dividends will be at the discretion of the Company\u2019s board of directors and will be based upon the Company\u2019s financial condition, operating results, capital requirements, plans for expansion, restrictions imposed by any financing arrangements and any other factors that the Company\u2019s board of directors deems relevant.\nTechniques employed by short sellers may drive down the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nShort selling is the practice of selling securities that the seller does not own but rather has borrowed from a third party with the intention of buying identical securities back at a later date to return to the lender. The short seller hopes to profit from a decline in the value of the securities between the sale of the borrowed securities and the purchase of the replacement shares, as the short seller expects to pay less in that purchase than it received in the sale. As it is in the short seller\u2019s best interests for the price of the stock to decline, many short sellers publish, or arrange for the publication of, negative opinions regarding the relevant issuer and its business prospects in order to create negative market momentum and generate profits for themselves after selling a stock short. These short attacks have, in the past, led to selling of shares in the market.\nIn the recent past, public companies that have substantially all of their operations in China have been the subject of short selling. Much of the scrutiny and negative publicity has centered around allegations of a lack of effective internal control over financial reporting resulting in financial and accounting irregularities and mistakes, inadequate corporate governance policies or a lack of adherence thereto and, in many cases, allegations of fraud. As a result, many of these companies are now conducting internal and external investigations into the allegations and, in the interim, are subject to shareholder lawsuits and/or SEC enforcement actions.\nIt is not clear what effect such negative publicity would have on the Company, if any. If the Company were to become the subject of any unfavorable allegations, whether such allegations are proven to be true or untrue, the Company could have to expend a significant amount of resources to investigate such allegations and/or defend itself. While the Company would strongly defend against any such short seller attacks, the Company may be constrained in the manner in which it can proceed against the relevant short seller by principles of freedom of speech, applicable state law or issues of commercial confidentiality. Such a situation could be costly and time-consuming, and could distract the Company\u2019s management from growing the Company. Even if such allegations are ultimately proven to be groundless, allegations against the Company could severely impact its business operations and stockholders equity, and any investment in the Company\u2019s stock could be greatly reduced or rendered worthless.\nThe Company\u2019s secured credit facilities contain certain financial covenants that it may not satisfy, which, if not satisfied, could result in the acceleration of the amounts due under the Company\u2019s secured credit facilities and the limitation of the Company\u2019s ability to borrow additional funds in the future.\nThe agreements governing the Company\u2019s secured credit facilities subject it to various financial and other restrictive covenants with which the Company must comply on an ongoing or periodic basis. These covenants include, but are not limited to, restrictions on the utilization of the funds and the maintenance of certain financial ratios. If the Company violate any of these covenants, the Company\u2019s outstanding debt under the Company\u2019s secured credit facilities could become immediately due and payable, the Company\u2019s lenders could proceed against any collateral securing such indebtedness and the Company\u2019s ability to borrow additional funds in the future may be limited. Alternatively, the Company could be forced to refinance or renegotiate the terms and conditions of the Company\u2019s secured credit facilities, including the interest rates, financial and restrictive covenants and security requirements of the secured credit facilities, on terms that may be significantly less favorable to the Company.\nRISKS RELATED TO DOING BUSINESS IN CHINA AND OTHER COUNTRIES BESIDES THE UNITED STATES\nThe Company may face a severe operating environment during times of economic recession.\nThe sales volume of the Company\u2019s core products is largely influenced by the demand for its customers\u2019 end products which are mostly sold in the Chinese markets. Future economic crises, either within China or without, may lead to a drastic drop in demand for the Company\u2019s products.\nInflation in China could negatively affect the Company\u2019s profitability and growth.\nChina\u2019s economy has experienced rapid growth, much of it due to the issuance of debt over the last few years. This debt-fueled economic growth has led to growth in the money supply, causing rising inflation. If prices for the Company\u2019s products rise at a rate that is insufficient to compensate for the rise in the cost of production, it may harm the Company\u2019s profitability. In order to control inflation, the Chinese government has imposed controls on bank credit, limits on loans and other restrictions on economic activities. Such policies have led to a slowing of economic growth. Additional measures could further slow economic activity in China, which could, in turn, materially increase the Company\u2019s costs while also reducing demand for the Company\u2019s products.\nThe Chinese government\u2019s macroeconomic policies could have a negative effect on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nThe Chinese government has implemented various measures from time to time to control the rate of economic growth in the PRC. Some of these measures may have a negative effect on the Company over the short or long term. Recently, to cope with high inflation and economic imbalances, the Chinese government has tightened monetary policy and implemented floating exchange rate policy. In addition, in order to alleviate some of the effects of unbalanced growth and social discontent, the Chinese government has enacted a series of social programs and anti-inflationary measures. These, in turn, have increased the costs on the financial and manufacturing sectors, without having alleviated the effects of high inflation and economic imbalances. The Chinese government\u2019s macroeconomic policies, even if effected properly, may significantly slow down China\u2019s economy or cause great social unrest, all of which would have a negative effect on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nThe economic, political and social conditions in China could affect the Company\u2019s business.\nMost of the Company\u2019s business, assets and operations are located in China. The economy of China differs from the economies of most developed countries in many respects, including government involvement, level of development, growth rate, control of foreign exchange and allocation of resources. The economy of China has been transitioning from a planned economy to a more market-oriented economy. Although the Chinese government has implemented measures emphasizing the utilization of market forces for economic reform, the reduction of state ownership of productive assets and the establishment of sound corporate governance in business enterprises, a substantial portion of productive assets in China is still owned by the Chinese government.\nIn addition, the Chinese government continues to play a significant role in regulating industry by imposing industrial policies. It also exercises significant control over China\u2019s economic growth through the allocation of resources, controlling payment of foreign currency-denominated obligations, setting monetary policy and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies. Therefore, the Chinese government\u2019s involvement in the economy could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business operations, results of operations and/or financial condition.\nBecause the Company\u2019s operations are mostly located outside of the United States and are subject to Chinese laws, any change of Chinese laws may adversely affect its business.\nMost of the Company\u2019s operations are in the PRC, which exposes it to risks, such as exchange controls and currency restrictions, currency fluctuations and devaluations, changes in local economic conditions, changes in Chinese laws and regulations, exposure to possible expropriation or other PRC government actions, and unsettled political conditions. These factors may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operations or on its business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s international expansion plans subject it to risks inherent in doing business internationally.\nThe Company\u2019s long-term business strategy relies on the expansion of its international sales outside China by targeting markets, such as the United States and Brazil. The Company\u2019s net sales outside of China increased from $ 58.3 million in 2014 to $ 61.1 million in 2015. Risks affecting the Company\u2019s international expansion include challenges caused by distance, language and cultural differences, conflicting and changing laws and regulations, foreign laws, international import and export legislation, trading and investment policies, foreign currency fluctuations, the burdens of complying with a wide variety of laws and regulations, protectionist laws and business practices that favor local businesses in some countries, foreign tax consequences, higher costs associated with doing business internationally, restrictions on the export or import of technology, difficulties in staffing and managing international operations, trade and tariff restrictions, and variations in tariffs, quotas, taxes and other market barriers. These risks could harm the Company\u2019s international expansion efforts, which could in turn materially and adversely affect its business, operating results and financial condition.\nOn September 17, 2012, the United States filed a trade case with the World Trade Organization, \u201cWTO,\u201d against the PRC with respect to the PRC government\u2019s purported provision of subsidies to the automobile and automobile-parts enterprises in the PRC. If the WTO rules against China in this trade case, the cost of sales of the Company could increase due to the imposition of any tariff and/or the Company\u2019s ability to export products to the United States could be limited, which could affect the Company\u2019s business and operating results.\nIn addition, under Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the SEC has adopted additional disclosure requirements related to the source of certain \u201cconflict minerals\u201d for issuers for which such \u201cconflict minerals\u201d are necessary to the functionality or production of a product manufactured, or contracted to be manufactured, by that issuer. The metals covered by the rules include tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold, commonly referred to as \u201c3TG.\u201d If these materials are necessary to the functionality or production of a product manufactured, or contracted to be manufactured, the rules require a reasonable country of origin inquiry be conducted to determine if an issuer knows, or has reason to believe, that any of the minerals used in the production process may have originated from the Democratic Republic of the Congo or an adjoining country. In such a case, if an issuer were not able to determine that the minerals did not originate from a covered country or conclude that there is no reason to believe that the minerals used in the production process may have originated in a covered country, that issuer could be required to perform supply chain due diligence on members of its supply chain. Global supply chains can have multiple layers, thus the costs of complying with these new requirements could be substantial. These new requirements may also reduce the number of suppliers that provide conflict-free metals, and may affect a company\u2019s ability to obtain products in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. If the Company was to source such 3TG minerals that are necessary to the functionality or production of a product manufactured, or contracted to be manufactured, compliance costs with these rules and/or the unavailability of raw materials could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe Company faces risks associated with currency exchange rate fluctuations; any adverse fluctuation may adversely affect its operating margins.\nAlthough the Company is incorporated in the State of Delaware, in the United States, the majority of its current revenues are in Chinese currency. Conducting business in currencies other than U.S. dollars subjects the Company to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could have a negative impact on its reported operating results. Fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies impact the Company\u2019s revenues, cost of revenues and operating margins and result in foreign currency translation gains and losses. Historically, the Company has not engaged in exchange rate hedging activities. Although the Company may implement hedging strategies to mitigate this risk, these strategies may not eliminate its exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations and involve costs and risks of their own, such as ongoing management time and expertise requirements, external costs to implement the strategy and potential accounting implications.\nIf relations between the United States and China worsen, the Company\u2019s stock price may decrease and the Company may have difficulty accessing the U.S. capital markets.\nAt various times during recent years, the United States and China have had disagreements over political and economic issues. Controversies may arise in the future between these two countries. Any political or trade controversies between the United States and China could adversely affect the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock and its ability to access U.S. capital markets.\nThe Chinese government could change its policies toward private enterprise, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company\u2019s business is subject to political and economic uncertainties in China and may be adversely affected by China\u2019s political, economic and social developments. Over the past several years, the Chinese government has pursued economic reform policies including the encouragement of private economic activity and greater economic decentralization. The Chinese government may not continue to pursue these policies or may alter them to the Company\u2019s detriment from time to time. Changes in policies, laws and regulations, or in their interpretation or the imposition of confiscatory taxation, restrictions on currency conversion, restrictions or prohibitions on dividend payments to stockholders, devaluations of currency or the nationalization or other expropriation of private enterprises could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business. Nationalization or expropriation could result in the total loss of the Company\u2019s investment in China.\nGovernment control of currency conversion and future movements in exchange rates may adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations and financial results.\nThe Company receives most of its revenues in Chinese Renminbi,\u201cRMB\u201d. A portion of such revenues will be converted into other currencies to meet the Company\u2019s foreign currency obligations. Foreign exchange transactions under the Company\u2019s capital account, including principal payments in respect of foreign currency-denominated obligations, continue to be subject to significant foreign exchange controls and require the approval of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange in China. These limitations could affect the Company\u2019s ability to obtain foreign exchange through debt or equity financing, or to obtain foreign exchange for capital expenditures.\nThe Chinese government controls its foreign currency reserves through restrictions on imports and conversion of RMB into foreign currency. In July 2005, the Chinese government has adjusted its exchange rate policy from \u201cFixed Rate\u201d to \u201cFloating Rate\u201d. Between July 2005 to December 2015, the exchange rate between the RMB and the U.S. dollar appreciated from RMB1.00 to $ 0.1205 to RMB1.00 to $ 0.1540. Any significant appreciation of the RMB is likely to decrease the income of export products and the cash flow of the Company.\nBecause the Chinese legal system is not fully developed, the Company and its security holders\u2019 legal protections may be limited.\nThe Chinese legal system is based on written statutes and their interpretation by the Supreme People\u2019s Court. Although the Chinese government introduced new laws and regulations to modernize its business, securities and tax systems on January 1, 1994, China does not yet possess a comprehensive body of business law. Because Chinese laws and regulations are relatively new, interpretation, implementation and enforcement of these laws and regulations involve uncertainties and inconsistencies and it may be difficult to enforce contracts. In addition, as the Chinese legal system develops, changes in such laws and regulations, their interpretation or their enforcement may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business operations. Moreover, interpretative case law does not have the same precedential value in China as in the United States, so legal compliance in China may be more difficult or expensive.\nIt may be difficult to serve the Company with legal process or enforce judgments against the Company or its management.\nMost of the Company\u2019s assets are located in China and twelve of its directors and officers are non-residents of the United States, and all or substantial portions of the assets of such non-residents are located outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible to effect service of process within the United States upon such persons to originate an action in the United States. Moreover, there is uncertainty that the courts of China would enforce judgments of U.S. courts against the Company, its directors or officers based on the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state, or an original action brought in China based upon the securities laws of the United States or any state.\nThe Company may be subject to fines and legal sanctions imposed by State Administration of Foreign Exchange, \u201cSAFE\u201d, or other Chinese government authorities if it or its Chinese directors or employees fail to comply with recent Chinese regulations relating to employee share options or shares granted by offshore listed companies to Chinese domestic individuals.\nOn December 25, 2006, the People\u2019s Bank of China, or PBOC, issued the Administration Measures on Individual Foreign Exchange Control, and the corresponding Implementation Rules were issued by SAFE on January 5, 2007. Both of these regulations became effective on February 1, 2007. According to these regulations, all foreign exchange matters relating to employee stock holding plans, share option plans or similar plans with Chinese domestic individuals\u2019 participation require approval from the SAFE or its authorized branch. On March 28, 2007, the SAFE issued the Application Procedure of Foreign Exchange Administration for Domestic Individuals Participating in Employee Stock Holding Plan or Stock Option Plan of Overseas-Listed Company, or the Stock Option Rule. Under the Stock Option Rule, Chinese domestic individuals who are granted share options or shares by an offshore listed company are required, through a Chinese agent or Chinese subsidiary of the offshore listed company, to register with the SAFE and complete certain other procedures. As the Company is an offshore listed company, its Chinese domestic directors and employees who may be granted share options or shares shall become subject to the Stock Option Rule. Under the Stock Option Rule, employees stock holding plans, share option plans or similar plans of offshore listed companies with Chinese domestic individuals\u2019 participation must be filed with the SAFE. After the Chinese domestic directors or employees exercise their options, they must apply for the amendment to the registration with the SAFE. As of December 31, 2015, the Company has completed such SAFE registration and other related procedures according to PRC law. If the Company or its Chinese domestic directors or employees fail to comply with these regulations in the future, the Company or its Chinese domestic directors or employees may be subject to fines or other legal sanctions imposed by the SAFE or other Chinese government authorities.\nCapital outflow policies in China may hamper the Company\u2019s ability to declare and pay dividends to its stockholders.\nChina has adopted currency and capital transfer regulations. These regulations may require the Company to comply with complex regulations for the movement of capital. Although the Company\u2019s management believes that it will be in compliance with these regulations, should these regulations or the interpretation of them by courts or regulatory agencies change, the Company may not be able to pay dividends to its stockholders outside of China. In addition, under current Chinese law, the Company\u2019s joint-ventures and wholly-owned enterprise in China must retain a reserve equal to 10% of its net income after taxes, not to exceed 50% of its registered capital. Accordingly, this reserve will not be available to be distributed as dividends to the Company\u2019s stockholders. The Company presently does not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future. The Company\u2019s board of directors intends to follow a policy of retaining all of its earnings to finance the development and execution of its strategy and the expansion of its business.\nRegistered public accounting firms in China, including the Company\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm, are not inspected by the U.S. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, which deprives the Company and its investors of the benefits of such inspection.\nAuditors of companies whose shares are registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and traded publicly in the United States, including the Company\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm, must be registered with the U.S. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the \u201cPCAOB,\u201d and are required by the laws of the United States to undergo regular inspections by the PCAOB to assess their compliance with the laws of the United States and professional standards applicable to auditors. The Company\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm is located in, and organized under the laws of, the PRC, which is a jurisdiction where the PCAOB, notwithstanding the requirements of U.S. law, is currently unable to conduct inspections without the approval of the Chinese authorities, which approval has not been granted for auditors such as the Company\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm. This lack of PCAOB inspections in China prevents the PCAOB from fully evaluating audits and quality control procedures of the Company\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm. As a result, the Company and investors in its common stock are deprived of the benefits of such PCAOB inspections.\nThe inability of the PCAOB to conduct inspections of auditors in China makes it more difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm\u2019s audit procedures or quality control procedures as compared to auditors outside of China that are subject to PCAOB inspections, which could cause investors and potential investors in the Company\u2019s stock to lose confidence in its audit procedures and reported financial information and the quality of its financial statements.\nIf additional remedial measures are imposed on the Big Four PRC-based accounting firms, including our independent registered public accounting firm, in administrative proceedings brought by the SEC alleging the firms\u2019 failure to meet specific criteria set by the SEC, we could be unable to timely file future financial statements in compliance with the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\nIn December 2012, the SEC instituted administrative proceedings against the Big Four PRC-based accounting firms, including our independent registered public accounting firm, alleging that these firms had violated U.S. securities laws and the SEC\u2019s rules and regulations thereunder by failing to provide to the SEC the firms\u2019 audit work papers with respect to certain PRC-based companies that are publicly traded in the United States. On January 22, 2014, the administrative law judge (ALJ) presiding over the matter rendered an initial decision that each of the firms had violated the SEC\u2019s rules of practice by failing to produce audit work papers to the SEC. The initial decision censured each of the firms and barred them from practicing before the SEC for a period of six months. The Big Four PRC-based accounting firms appealed the ALJ\u2019s initial decision to the SEC. The ALJ\u2019s decision does not take effect unless and until it is endorsed by the SEC. In February 2015, the four China-based accounting firms each agreed to a censure and to pay a fine to the SEC to settle the dispute and avoid suspension of their ability to practice before the SEC and audit U.S.-listed companies. The settlement required the firms to follow detailed procedures and to provide the SEC with access to Chinese firms\u2019 audit documents via the China Securities Regulatory Commission, or the CSRC. If future document productions fail to meet specified criteria, the SEC retains authority to impose a variety of additional remedial measures on the firms depending on the nature of the failure. While we cannot predict whether the SEC will further review the four China-based accounting firms\u2019 compliance with specified criteria or if the results of such a review would result in the SEC imposing penalties such as suspensions or restarting the administrative proceedings, if the accounting firms are subject to additional remedial measures, our ability to file our financial statements in compliance with SEC requirements could be impacted. A determination that we have not timely filed financial statements in compliance with SEC requirements could ultimately lead to the delisting of our common stock from NASDAQ or the termination of the registration of our common stock under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or both, which would substantially reduce or effectively terminate the trading of our common stock in the United States.", "PERMNO": 90313, "SIC": 3714, "TIC": "CAAS"}
