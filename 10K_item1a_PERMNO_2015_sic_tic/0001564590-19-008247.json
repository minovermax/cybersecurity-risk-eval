RISK FACTORS\nFrom time to time, important factors may cause actual results to differ materially from future expected results based on performance expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements made by us, including known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are not possible to predict or control. Several of these factors are described from time to time in our filings with the SEC, but the factors described in filings are not the only risks that the Corporation faces.\nCyclical demand for products and economic downturns may reduce the demand for, and sales of, our products, which could adversely affect our margins and profitability.\nA significant portion of the Forged and Cast Engineered Products segment\u2019s sales consists of mill rolls to customers in the global steel and aluminum industry which can be periodically impacted by economic or cyclical downturns. Such downturns, the timing and length of which are difficult to predict, may reduce the demand for, and sales of, our forged and cast rolls both in the United States and the rest of the world. Lower demand for rolls may also adversely impact profitability as other competing roll producers lower selling prices in the marketplace in order to fill their manufacturing capacity. Cancellation of orders or deferral of delivery of rolls may occur and produce an adverse impact on financial results. In addition, sales of non-roll product, consisting of open-die forged product primarily for the oil and gas industry, are impacted by fluctuations in global energy prices.\nExcess global capacity in steel industry could lower prices for our products, which would adversely affect our sales, margins and profitability, as well as collectability of receivables and salability of in-process inventory.\nThe global steel manufacturing capacity continues to exceed global consumption of steel products. Such excess capacity often results in manufacturers in certain countries exporting steel at prices significantly below their home market prices (often due to local government assistance or subsidies), which leads to global market destabilization and reduced sales and profitability of some of our and our subsidiaries\u2019 customers, which, in turn, affects our sales and profit margins, as well as collectability of receivables and salability of in-process inventory.\nA reduction in the level of export sales, as well as other economic factors in foreign countries, may have an adverse impact on our financial results.\nExports are a significant proportion of our subsidiaries\u2019 sales. Historically, changes in foreign exchange rates, particularly in respect of the U.S. dollar, British pound, Swedish krona and the euro, have impacted the export of our products and may do so again in the future. Other factors that may adversely impact export sales and operating results include political and economic instability, export controls, changes in tax laws and tariffs and new indigenous producers in overseas markets. A reduction in the level of export sales may have an adverse impact on our financial results. In addition, exchange rate changes may allow foreign roll suppliers to compete in our home markets.\nFluctuation of the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nCertain of our subsidiaries operate in foreign jurisdictions and, accordingly, earn revenues, pay expenses, own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Since our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rate during each reporting period, and assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the end of each reporting period. Therefore, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies will affect the translated value for revenue, expenses and balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies and could materially affect our financial results expressed in U.S. dollars.\nCommodity price increases, as well as any reductions in electricity, gas supply or shortage of key production materials, could adversely impact our production, which would result in lower profitability.\nOur subsidiaries use certain commodities in the manufacture of their products. These include steel scrap, ferroalloys, energy and graphite electrodes. Any sudden price increase may cause a reduction in profit margins or losses where fixed-priced contracts have been accepted or increases cannot be obtained in future selling prices. In addition, there may be curtailment in electricity or gas supply which would adversely impact production. Shortage of critical materials, while driving up costs, may be of such severity as to disrupt production, all of which may impact sales and profitability. The global supply shortage of graphite electrodes used for electric arc\nfurnace melting of our steels could materially impact results of operations should we be unable to secure sufficient supply for our production requirements.\nWe may not be able to realize the expected benefits from the acquisitions that we make, and we may experience difficulties in integrating the acquired businesses.\nWe have made in the past, and may continue to make, certain acquisitions and enter into joint ventures which are intended to complement or expand our businesses. These acquisitions involve a variety of challenges and risks. We may encounter difficulties integrating acquired businesses with our operations or applying our internal control processes to these acquisitions. Other risks associated with acquisitions are the diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, the potential loss of key employees and customers of the acquired companies, the possible assumption of unknown liabilities, and potential disputes with the sellers. We may not be able to complete certain acquisitions due to antitrust laws and regulations in various jurisdictions. Additionally, we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we anticipate when we first enter into a transaction. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nA work stoppage or another industrial action on the part of any of our unions may be disruptive to our operations.\nOur subsidiaries have several key operations which are subject to multi-year collective bargaining agreements with their hourly work forces. While we believe we have good relations with our unions, there is the risk of industrial action or work stoppage at the expiration of an agreement if contract negotiations break down, which may disrupt manufacturing and impact results of operations.\nDependence on certain equipment may cause an interruption in our production if such equipment is out of operation for an extended period of time, which would result in lower sales and profitability.\nOur subsidiaries\u2019 principal business relies on certain unique equipment such as an electric arc furnace and a spin cast work roll machine. Although a comprehensive critical spare inventory of key components for this equipment is maintained, if any such unique equipment is out of operation for an extended period, it may result in a significant reduction in our sales and earnings.\nThe ultimate liability of our subsidiaries for claims alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos-containing components historically used in certain products of our subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity in the future.\nOur subsidiaries, and in some cases, we, are defendants in numerous claims alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos-containing components historically used in certain products of our subsidiaries. Through year-end 2018, our insurance has covered a substantial majority of our settlement and defense costs. We believe that the estimated costs net of anticipated insurance recoveries of our pending and future asbestos legal proceedings should not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity. However, there can be no assurance that our subsidiaries or we will not be subject to significant additional claims in the future or that our subsidiaries\u2019 ultimate liability with respect to asbestos claims will not present significantly greater and longer lasting financial exposure than provided in our financial statements. The ultimate net liability with respect to such pending and any unasserted claims is subject to various uncertainties, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe number of claims that are brought in the future;\n\u2022\nthe costs of defending and settling these claims;\n\u2022\ninsolvencies among our insurance carriers and the risk of future insolvencies;\n\u2022\nthe possibility that adverse jury verdicts could require damage payments in amounts greater than the amounts for which we have historically settled claims;\n\u2022\npossible changes in the litigation environment or federal and state law governing the compensation of asbestos claimants; and\n\u2022\nthe risk that the bankruptcies of other asbestos defendants may increase our costs.\nBecause of the uncertainties related to such claims, it is possible that the ultimate liability could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity in the future.\nThe loss of any of our key management or our inability to attract or retain qualified personnel may prevent us from our implementing our business strategy.\nOur success is dependent on the management, experience and leadership skills of our senior management team and key employees. The loss of any of these individuals or an inability to attract, retain and maintain additional personnel with similar industry experience could prevent us from implementing our business strategy. We cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our existing senior management and key personnel or to attract additional qualified personnel when needed.\nPotential attacks on information technology infrastructure and other cyber-based business disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on integrated information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) systems to conduct our business. IT systems failures, including risks associated with upgrading our systems or in successfully integrating IT and other systems in connection with the integration of businesses we acquire, network disruptions and breaches of data security could disrupt our operations by impeding our processing of transactions, our ability to protect customer or company information and our financial reporting. Our computer systems, including our back-up systems, could be damaged or interrupted by power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, internal or external security breaches, events such as fires, earthquakes, floods, tornadoes and hurricanes, and/or errors by our employees. Cyber-based risks, in particular, are evolving and include potential attacks to our IT infrastructure and to the IT infrastructure of third parties in attempts to gain unauthorized access to our confidential or other proprietary information, or information relating to our employees, customers and other third parties. Although we have taken steps to address these concerns, there can be no assurance that a system failure or data security breach will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nA change in the existing regulatory environment could negatively affect our operations and financial performance.\nIn 2018, the United States imposed tariffs of 25% on primary steel imports and 10% on primary aluminum imports into the U.S. As consumers of steel and aluminum in some of our products, our cost base is exposed to the impact of this action, or similar actions, on our margins, and we could potentially lose market share to foreign competitors not subject to similar tariffs increases. Our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may continue to be affected by these tariffs, or similar actions. Additionally, should a new trade agreement not occur which mitigates or neutralizes the impact of the tariffs, or similar actions, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may continue to be negatively impacted.\nNew trade restrictions and regulatory burdens associated with \u201cBrexit\u201d could adversely impact our operations and financial performance.\nOn June 23, 2016, voters in the United Kingdom (\u201cU.K.\u201d) approved a referendum to exit from the European Union (\u201cE.U.\u201d), commonly known as \u201cBrexit.\u201d The U.K. is scheduled to leave the EU on March 29, 2019, unless the U.K. decides to halt the process and stay in the EU prior to that deadline. In November 2018, the EU and the U.K. agreed upon the terms of an agreement which sets out the terms of the U.K.\u2019s withdrawal from the EU and includes a transitional period until December 31, 2020. If the agreement is not ratified by the EU and U.K. before the end of March 2019, then, absent the U.K. withdrawing its notice under Article 50 or members of the EU agreeing to extend the two-year notice period, the U.K. will leave the EU with no agreements in place beyond those temporary arrangements which have been or may be put in place. Given the lack of comparable precedent, it is unclear what financial, trade and legal implications of the U.K. leaving the EU with no agreements in place would have and how such withdrawal would affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may not be able successfully to consummate proposed divestitures or restructure operations.\nWe may, from time to time, divest businesses that become less of a strategic fit within our core portfolio or restructure operations to improve operating results. Our profitability may be impacted by gains or losses on the sale or restructuring of such businesses and our liquidity may be affected by the length of time we retain these businesses. Additionally, we may be required to record asset impairment or restructuring charges related to these businesses which may adversely impact our financial position, liquidity and results of operations.\nWe face limitations in availability of capital to fund our strategic plans.\nWe are parties to a Revolving Credit and Security Agreement (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d), a senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility collateralized by a first priority perfected security interest in substantially all of our assets. The Credit Agreement provides for initial borrowings not to exceed $100 million, with an option to increase the credit facility by an additional $50 million at our request and with the approval of the banks, but restricts us from incurring additional indebtedness outside of the Credit Agreement, unless otherwise approved by the banks. The Credit Agreement is subject to various affirmative and negative covenants and contains various\nsub-limits, including those based on type of collateral and borrowings by geographic region. If the financial covenants become difficult to meet or if our borrowing needs increase beyond the prescribed limits, our results of operations and liquidity may be materially adversely affected. In addition, our access to public debt markets is limited based on our size, credit profile and not being a well-known seasoned issuer.\nA substantial majority of our authorized shares of common stock under our articles of incorporation are either outstanding or reserved for issuance.\nOur restated articles of incorporation currently authorize the issuance of 20,000,000 shares of common stock and 3,000,000 shares of preferred stock, of which 150,000 are designated as Series A Preferred Stock. As of the date of this filing, 12,494,846 shares of common stock and zero shares of Series A Preferred Stock are outstanding, a total of 797,354 shares of common stock are reserved for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding stock options and upon vesting of restricted stock units, and a total of 760,375 shares of common stock are reserved for issuance in connection with future issuances of shares under our 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan. After taking into account the total number of shares of common stock issued and outstanding, in addition to the aggregate number of shares of common stock reserved for future issuance, less than 6,000,000 authorized shares of common stock remain available to be issued.\nWe currently intend to solicit the approval of our shareholders at our upcoming 2019 annual meeting of shareholders to increase the number of authorized shares to 40,000,000. Absent the approval, our ability to use our shares to raise additional capital in the future will be limited and, as result, may impair our financial flexibility, including our liquidity needs and our ability to repay our debt obligations, execute our business plan, make future acquisitions, and fund operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or prospects.", "PERMNO": 18075, "SIC": 3460, "TIC": "AP"}
