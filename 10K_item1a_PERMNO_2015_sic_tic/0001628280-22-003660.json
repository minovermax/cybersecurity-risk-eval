Certain important factors may have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations, and you should carefully consider them. Accordingly, in evaluating our business, we encourage you to consider the following discussion of risk factors, in its entirety, in addition to other information contained in or incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our other public filings with the SEC.\nRisk Factors Summary\nThe following is a summary of the principal risks that could adversely affect our business, conditions and financial results.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Capital\n\u2022We are not currently profitable and may never become profitable.\n\u2022Our financial results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter, which makes our results difficult to predict and could cause our results to fall short of expectations.\nRisks Related to the Commercialization and Development of Our Product Candidates\n\u2022We are heavily dependent on the commercial success of TYMLOS; we may not be able to meet expectations with respect to TYMLOS sales or attain or maintain profitability and positive cash-flow from operations.\n\u2022Our current and future product candidates may never receive regulatory approval.\n\u2022We may never receive approval for, or commercialize, our products outside of the United States.\n\u2022Any collaboration arrangements that we may enter into in the future may not be successful, which could adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates.\n\u2022Pre-clinical studies and clinical trials are very expensive, time-consuming and difficult to design and implement.\n\u2022We have sold or licensed our oncology assets; however there can be no assurance that those or other transactions will yield additional value for stockholders.\n\u2022The results of clinical trials may not support our product candidate claims.\n\u2022If serious adverse or undesirable side effects are identified during the development or commercialization of our product candidates, we may need to abandon our development or commercialization of some of our product candidates or products.\n\u2022Any product candidate for which we have or obtain marketing approval, including TYMLOS, is subject to restrictions or potential withdrawal from the market and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we experience unanticipated problems with our products, when and if any of them are approved.\n\u2022The commercial success of TYMLOS and any product candidates that we may develop and that may be approved will depend upon the degree of market acceptance by regulators, key opinion leaders, physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community.\n\u2022We may expend resources to pursue a particular product candidate or indication and fail to capitalize on product candidates or indications that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties\n\u2022We currently rely on third parties to manufacture TYMLOS and to produce our product candidates; our dependence on these parties, including any inability on our part to accurately anticipate product demand and timely secure manufacturing capacity to meet commercial or clinical product demand may impair the commercialization of TYMLOS and the research and development activities and potential commercialization of our product candidates.\n\u2022We have entered into, and in the future may enter into, licenses and/or collaborations with third parties for the development and commercialization of our product candidates. If those licenses and/or collaborations, are not successful, we may not be able to capitalize on the market potential of these product candidates.\nRisks Related to Marketing and Sale of Our Products\n\u2022If we are unable to maintain appropriate and effective commercial capabilities on our own or through partnerships or collaborations, we may not be able to continue to successfully commercialize TYMLOS or any of our product candidates or generate product revenue.\n\u2022If we cannot compete successfully against other drug companies, we may not achieve sufficient product revenues and our business will suffer.\n\u2022We may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of our products in response to product liability lawsuits.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\n\u2022If we fail to comply with our obligations in our intellectual property licenses with third parties, we could lose license rights that are important to our business.\n\u2022If our efforts to protect our intellectual property related to TYMLOS/abaloparatide-SC, and/or our other current or future product candidates fail to adequately protect these assets or if we are unable to secure all necessary intellectual property, we may lose the ability to license or successfully commercialize one or more of these products or product candidates.\n\u2022Patent terms may be inadequate to protect our competitive position on our product candidates for an adequate amount of time.\n\u2022Intellectual property litigation could cause us to spend substantial resources and distract our personnel from their normal responsibilities.\nRisks Related to Legislation and Administrative Actions\n\u2022Healthcare reform may have a material adverse effect on our industry and our results of operations.\n\u2022We are subject to healthcare laws, regulation and enforcement, and our failure to comply with those laws could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial conditions.\nRisks Related to Employee Matters and Managing Our Workforce\n\u2022If we are unable to successfully maintain and further develop internal commercialization capabilities, sales of TYMLOS or other products may be negatively impacted.\n\u2022We rely on key executive officers and scientific and medical advisors, and their knowledge of our business and technical expertise would be difficult to replace.\nRisks Relating to Our Securities\n\u2022Our stock price may be volatile, and the value of an investment in our common stock may decline.\n\u2022Our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nFor a more complete discussion of the material risks facing our business, see below.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Capital\nWe are not currently profitable and may never become profitable.\nWe are not currently profitable and may never become profitable. We had net losses of $70.2 million, $109.2 million, and $133.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $1.4 billion. Even if we succeed in our efforts in continuing to commercialize TYMLOS and our collaboration partners succeed in their efforts to commercialize abaloparatide-SC outside the U.S., we may incur losses and never achieve or maintain profitability. We also may incur additional operating and capital expenses as we:\n\u2022continue to maintain and build our internal infrastructure, including hiring additional personnel that may be required for our existing or any future product candidates, including product candidates that we acquire from other companies;\n\u2022continue to commercialize TYMLOS or any product candidates, if approved;\n\u2022continue to undertake preclinical development and clinical trials for product candidates; and\n\u2022seek regulatory approvals for product candidates.\nUnless and until we become profitable, we may need to raise additional capital to continue to operate our business. Our failure to achieve or maintain profitability or to raise additional capital could negatively impact the value of our securities.\nUnless and until we become profitable, we may need to raise additional capital, which may not be available on favorable terms, if at all, in order to continue operating our business.\nOur ability to become profitable depends upon our ability to generate sufficient revenue. Despite our commercialization of TYMLOS, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to attain or maintain profitability. Our ability to generate profits from sales of TYMLOS is subject to our ability to manufacture commercial quantities of TYMLOS with third parties at acceptable cost levels and maintain sales and marketing capabilities. Even though TYMLOS has been approved by the FDA for marketing and commercial sale for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, it may not sufficiently gain or maintain market acceptance, leadership or commercial success. For the foreseeable future, we expect to fund our operations and capital expenditures with our product revenues, existing cash and cash equivalents and short and long-term marketable securities, or through strategic financing opportunities.\nBased upon our cash and cash equivalents balance as of December 31, 2021 and funds available to us through our credit facilities, we believe that, prior to the consideration of proceeds from partnering and/or collaboration activities, we have sufficient capital to fund our development plans, U.S. commercial and other operational activities for at least twelve months from the date of this filing. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use up our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. If we fail to obtain additional capital, should we need it, we may be forced to reduce or forego sales and marketing efforts for TYMLOS or may be unable to complete our planned preclinical and clinical trials and obtain approval of our product candidates from the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities. In addition, we could be forced to discontinue product development or forego attractive business opportunities or discontinue our operations entirely. Any additional sources of financing may not be available or may not be available on favorable terms and will likely involve the issuance of additional equity securities, which will have a dilutive effect on stockholders. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the scope and progress made in our research and development activities and our clinical studies.\nOur existing and any future indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to operate our business.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $150 million of outstanding long-term debt under the Amended and Restated Credit and Security Agreement (\u201cTerm Credit Agreement\u201d) and none outstanding debt under the Amended and Restated Credit and Security Agreement (Revolving Loan) (the \u201cRevolving Credit Agreement,\u201d together with the Term Credit Agreement, the \u201cCredit Agreements\u201d), each by and between Radius Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Radius Health Ventures, Inc. (collectively with the Company, the \u201cBorrowers\u201d) and MidCap Financial Trust (\u201cMidCap\u201d), as lender. We could incur additional indebtedness in the future. Our payment obligations under the Credit Agreements reduce cash available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, research and development and general corporate needs. In addition, indebtedness under the Credit Agreements bears interest at a variable rate, making us vulnerable to increases in market interest rates. If market rates increase substantially, we will have to pay additional interest on this indebtedness, which would further reduce cash available for our other business needs.\nOur obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Borrowers and their wholly-owned subsidiaries. The security interest granted over these assets could limit our ability to obtain additional debt financing. In addition, the Credit Agreements contain affirmative and negative covenants customarily applicable to senior secured credit facilities, including covenants that, among other things, will limit or restrict our ability, subject to negotiated exceptions, to incur additional indebtedness and additional liens on our assets, engage in mergers or acquisitions or dispose of assets, pay dividends or make other distributions, voluntarily prepay other indebtedness, enter into transactions with affiliated persons, make investments, and change the nature of our businesses. In addition, we are required to maintain an amount of unrestricted cash of at least $50.0 million and to achieve net revenue for each preceding twelve month period of at least certain specified amounts. Failure to comply with the covenants in the Credit Agreements, including the minimum cash and minimum net revenue covenants, could result in the acceleration of our obligations under the Credit Agreements, and, if such acceleration were to occur, it would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows and prospects.\nThe obligations under the Credit Agreements are subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of specified events of default, including payment default, change in control, bankruptcy, insolvency, certain defaults under other material debt, certain events with respect to regulatory actions relating to abaloparatide and a material adverse change in our business, operations or other financial condition. If an event of default occurs, MidCap may declare all or any portion of the outstanding principal amount of the borrowings plus accrued and unpaid interest to be due and payable.\nIn addition, as of December 31, 2021, we had outstanding $192.8 million principal amount of our 3% Convertible Senior Notes due September 1, 2024 (the \u201cConvertible Notes\u201d). The Convertible Notes are senior unsecured obligations of us and upon conversion the notes are convertible into cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares, at the our election.\nWhile the indenture governing our Convertible Notes does not include covenants restricting the operation of our business, except in certain limited circumstances, in the event of a default under any of the Convertible Senior Notes, the applicable noteholders or the trustee under the indenture governing the applicable Convertible Senior Notes may accelerate our payment obligations under such Convertible Senior Notes, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The indenture governing our Convertible Notes also includes cross-default features providing that certain failures to pay for outstanding indebtedness would result in a default under the indenture governing our Convertible Notes. We are also required to offer to repurchase the Convertible Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change, which could include, among other things, any acquisition of our company (other than an acquisition in which at least 90% of the consideration is common stock listed on The Nasdaq Global or Global Select Market or The New York Stock Exchange), subject to the terms of the indenture governing the Convertible Notes.\nOur outstanding indebtedness and any future indebtedness, combined with our other financial obligations, could increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and market conditions, limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry and impose a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or better debt servicing options.\nIf we do not generate sufficient cash flows from operations or if future borrowings are not available to us in an amount sufficient to pay our indebtedness, including payments of principal when due on our outstanding indebtedness or, in the case of our Convertible Notes, in connection with a transaction involving us that constitutes a fundamental change under the indenture governing the Convertible Notes, or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before the maturity dates thereof, sell assets, reduce or delay currently planned activities or curtail operations, seek to raise additional capital or take other actions. We may not be able to execute any of these actions on commercially reasonable terms or at all. This, together with any of the factors described above, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or product candidates.\nIf we are unable to generate substantial product revenues, we may need to finance our cash needs through a combination of collaborations, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements, other marketing and distribution arrangements, equity offerings, royalty-based financing arrangements and debt financings. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a stockholder. Debt financing, if available and to the extent permitted under the Credit Agreement, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through marketing and distribution arrangements or other collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties or royalty-based financing arrangements, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates, or we may need to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. We have and may in the future engage in collaborations, sponsored research agreements, and other arrangements with academic researchers and institutions that have received and may receive funding from U.S. government agencies. As a result of these arrangements, the U.S. government or certain third parties may have rights in certain inventions developed during the course of the performance of such collaborations and agreements as required by law or by such agreements. If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our commercialization or product development efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nOur financial results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter, which makes our results difficult to predict and could cause our results to fall short of expectations.\nOur financial results may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control. For these reasons, comparing our financial results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful, and you should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance. Particularly over the near term as we continue to maintain and refine our commercial capabilities and commercialize TYMLOS, our revenues may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and our future quarterly and annual expenses as a percentage of our revenues may be significantly different from those we have recorded in the past or which we expect for the future. Our financial results in some quarters may fall below expectations. Any of these\nevents as well as the various risk factors listed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section could adversely affect our financial results and cause our stock price to fall.\nWe are subject to foreign currency risk.\nA portion of our commercial activities, including a significant portion of contract manufacturing processes in support of TYMLOS is conducted outside of the United States and a large portion of the costs incurred with these activities are denominated in the local currency of the country in which the activity is being conducted. As such, these costs could be subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. At present, we do not engage in hedging transactions to protect against uncertainty in future exchange rates between foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar. A decline in the value of the U.S. dollar against currencies in geographies in which we conduct clinical trials or contract manufacturing activities could have a negative impact on our research and development costs, our future inventory valuations, or our future cost of sales. We cannot predict the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, and foreign currency fluctuations in the future may adversely affect our business and our results of operations. For further discussion of our foreign currency risks, see \u201cItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d.\nAn adverse determination in any current or future lawsuits or arbitration proceedings to which we or partners or suppliers\nare a party could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe or our partners or suppliers may be the target of claims asserting violations of securities fraud and derivative actions, or other litigation or arbitration proceedings, including with respect to intellectual property rights. Any litigation or arbitration proceedings could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources. These lawsuits or arbitration proceedings may result in injunctive relief, large judgments or settlements against us, or our partners or suppliers, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and liquidity.\nWe are also subject to a variety of other types of potential claims, proceedings, investigations and litigation which may be initiated by government agencies or third parties. These include compliance matters, product regulation or safety, taxes, employee benefit plans, employment discrimination, health and safety, environmental, antitrust, customs, import/export, government contract compliance, financial controls or reporting, intellectual property, allegations of misrepresentation, false claims or false statements, commercial claims, claims regarding promotion of our product candidates, or other similar matters. In addition, government investigations related to the use of products, but not the efficacy themselves, may cause reputational harm to us. Negative publicity-whether accurate or inaccurate-about the efficacy, safety or side effects of our product candidates or product categories, whether involving us or a competitor, could materially reduce market acceptance for our product candidates, cause consumers to seek alternatives to our product candidates, result in product withdrawals, regulatory inquires or actions and cause our stock price to decline. Negative publicity could also result in an increased number of product liability claims, whether or not these claims have a basis in scientific fact. Any such claims, proceedings, investigations or litigation, regardless of the merits, might result in substantial costs, restrictions on product use or sales, or otherwise injure our business.\nRisks Related to the Commercialization and Development of Our Product Candidates\nWe are heavily dependent on the commercial success of TYMLOS; we may not be able to meet expectations with respect to TYMLOS sales or attain or maintain profitability and positive cash-flow from operations.\nOur ability to continue to successfully commercialize TYMLOS, our first and currently only approved product, is critical to the execution of our business strategy. TYMLOS may not maintain market acceptance in the United States, or in any international markets where it may subsequently be approved, among physicians, patients, and third-party payors, and may not be or remain commercially successful. The degree of market acceptance and commercial success of TYMLOS will depend on a number of factors, including the following:\n\u2022the acceptance of TYMLOS by patients and the medical community and the availability, perceived advantages and relative cost, safety and efficacy of alternative and competing treatments;\n\u2022the cost-effectiveness of TYMLOS, availability and level of coverage and reimbursement by third-party payors, including state and federal governments, pharmacy benefit managers and health insurance plans, the willingness and ability of patients to pay for TYMLOS, and the commensurate discounts, price concessions or rebates required to secure coverage and reimbursement by third-party payors;\n\u2022the effectiveness of our marketing, sales, and distribution strategy and efforts and the degree to which the approved labeling supports promotional initiatives for commercial success;\n\u2022the occurrence of any side effects, adverse reactions or misuse, or any unfavorable publicity in these areas;\n\u2022the ability of our third-party manufacturer(s) to manufacture commercial supplies of TYMLOS at acceptable costs, to remain in good standing with regulatory agencies, and to develop, validate and maintain commercially viable manufacturing processes that are, to the extent required, compliant with GMP regulations;\n\u2022our ability to remain compliant with laws and regulations that apply to us and our commercial activities;\n\u2022our ability to comply with changes in legislation or regulations in state or federal government programs that increase manufacturer financial obligations;\n\u2022our ability to obtain marketing approvals from foreign regulatory authorities, where and as applicable;\n\u2022FDA-mandated package inserts or labeling requirements;\n\u2022the actual market size for TYMLOS, which may be different than expected;\n\u2022the sufficiency of our drug supply to meet commercial and clinical demands which could be negatively impacted if our projections regarding the potential number of patients are inaccurate, we are subject to unanticipated regulatory requirements, our current drug supply is destroyed or negatively impacted at our manufacturing sites, storage sites or in transit, or any significant portion of our TYMLOS supply expires before we are able to sell it; and\n\u2022our ability to maintain, enforce and defend third-party challenges to our intellectual property rights in and to TYMLOS.\nWe may experience fluctuations in sales of TYMLOS from period to period and, ultimately, we may never generate sufficient revenues from TYMLOS to reach or maintain profitability or sustain our anticipated levels of operations. Any inability on our part to continue to successfully commercialize TYMLOS in the United States and any international markets where it may subsequently be approved, or any significant delay, could have a material adverse impact on our ability to execute upon our business strategy.\nOur current and future product candidates may never receive regulatory approval.\nOther than TYMLOS, we have no drug products for sale and may never be able to develop additional approved and marketable drug products. The research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, approval, sale, marketing and distribution of drug products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA in the United States and by comparable foreign regulatory authorities. We cannot assure you that we will receive the approvals necessary to commercialize any additional product candidates, including any product candidates we are currently developing or may acquire or develop in the future.\nObtaining approval of a product candidate is an extensive, lengthy, expensive and uncertain process, and may be delayed, limited or denied for many reasons, including:\n\u2022we may not be able to demonstrate that the product candidate is safe and effective to the satisfaction of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities;\n\u2022the results of our clinical studies may not meet the level of statistical or clinical significance required by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory activities for marketing approval;\n\u2022the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with the number, design, size, conduct or implementation of our clinical studies;\n\u2022we may be unable to demonstrate that the product candidate\u2019s clinical and other benefits outweigh its safety risks;\n\u2022the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with our interpretation of data from our preclinical studies and clinical studies or may require that we conduct additional studies;\n\u2022we may experience delays in testing, validation, manufacturing and delivery of our product candidates to the clinical sites;\n\u2022we may experience delays in having patients complete participation in a study or return for post-treatment follow-up;\n\u2022we may experience delays or difficulties in initiating clinical study sites;\n\u2022the FDA may not accept clinical data from clinical trials conducted by individual investigators or in countries where the standard of care is potentially different from the United States; and\n\u2022the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may identify deficiencies in the manufacturing processes or facilities of our third-party manufacturers.\nIn addition, the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may change their approval policies or adopt new regulations or guidance.\nThe approval process may also be delayed by changes in government regulation, future legislation or administrative action or changes in policy or guidance that occur prior to or during the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authority\u2019s review. Delays in obtaining regulatory approvals may prevent us from commercializing our product candidates.\nWe may never receive approval for, or commercialize, our products outside of the United States.\nApproval procedures vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from that required to obtain FDA approval. The regulatory approval process in other countries may include additional risks not detailed in these Risk Factors. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may have a negative effect on the regulatory process in others.\nOur collaboration agreements, including with Teijin, or any collaboration arrangements that we may enter into in the future may not be successful, which could adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates.\nThe continued development and commercialization of our product candidates will require substantial cash to fund expenses. For some of our product candidates, we have and may again decide to collaborate with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for the development and potential commercialization of those product candidates. For example, in July 2017, the Company entered into Teijin Agreement with Teijin for abaloparatide-SC in Japan. We will face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators and/or partners. Moreover, licensing arrangements are complex and time consuming to negotiate, document and implement. We may not be successful in our efforts to establish and implement such arrangements should we so choose to enter into such arrangements.\nThe terms of any collaborations or other arrangements that we may establish may not be favorable to us. If that were to occur or if we are not successful in entering into collaborations or other arrangements, we may have to curtail the development of a particular product candidate, reduce or delay its development program or one or more of our other development programs, delay its potential commercialization or reduce the scope of our sales or marketing activities, or increase our expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense. If we elect to increase our expenditures to fund development or commercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional capital, which may require us to divert capital from our other business strategies and initiatives, or may not be available to us at all. If we do not have sufficient funds, we will not be able to bring our product candidates to market and generate additional product revenue.\nOur current and any future collaborations or other arrangement may not be successful. The success of our collaboration or other arrangements will depend heavily on the efforts and activities of our future collaborators and/or partners. Collaborators and/or partners generally have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaborations or other arrangements. If a collaborator or partner fails to provide sufficient effort and resources to a development program, we may not realize the full potential or intended benefit of the collaboration or arrangement, and the development program may be delayed or curtailed.\nPre-clinical studies and clinical trials are very expensive, time-consuming and difficult to design and implement.\nPre-clinical studies and human clinical trials are very time consuming, expensive and difficult to design and implement, in part because they are subject to rigorous regulatory requirements. Furthermore, failure can occur at any stage of the trials. Events that may prevent successful completion of pre-clinical studies and clinical trials include:\n\u2022changes in government regulation or guidance with respect to pre-clinical studies or clinical trials that change the requirements for approval, including the size of any such trials;\n\u2022unforeseen safety issues or lack of effectiveness during clinical trials;\n\u2022unforeseen issues with drug supply, including batch failures and other supply chain issues;\n\u2022actions, or failures to act, by clinical research organizations or other organizations contracted to perform services for pre-clinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u2022slower than expected rates of patient recruitment and enrollment in the overall population or other prespecified populations;\n\u2022failure of sites to comply with requirements for conducting clinical trials;\n\u2022inability to monitor patients adequately during or after treatment; and\n\u2022inability or unwillingness of medical investigators to follow our clinical protocols.\nThere can be no assurance that Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3 testing will be completed successfully within any specified period of time, if at all. For example, delays in subject enrollment or interruptions in clinical trial supplies or investigational product may significantly extend a trial past its anticipated end date. In addition, we, the FDA, or other equivalent regulatory authorities and ethics committees with jurisdiction over our studies may suspend our clinical trials at any time if it appears that we are exposing participants to unacceptable health risks or if the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities find deficiencies in our regulatory submissions or the conduct of these trials. Therefore, we cannot predict with any certainty the schedule for existing or future clinical trials. Any such unexpected expenses or delays in our clinical trials could increase our need for additional capital, which may not be available on favorable terms or at all.\nWe have sold or licensed our oncology assets; however there can be no assurance that those or other transactions will yield additional value for stockholders.\nIn 2020, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Berlin-Chemie AG - Menarini Group (\u201cBerlin-Chemie\u201d) for elacestrant. We also sold RAD140 to Ellipses Pharma (\u201cEllipses\u201d). While both the Berlin-Chemie and Ellipses transactions provided for certain upfront payments, much of the consideration payable to us is in the form of development and sales milestones and royalties. There can be no assurances that we, Berlin-Chemie or Ellipses will be able to meet the conditions\nnecessary for such milestones or royalties to be paid. Further, under our license agreement with Berlin-Chemie we retained certain ongoing obligations with respect to elacestrant, which may be time-consuming, distracting to management and disruptive to our business operations, and if we are unable to effectively manage the process, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nAny strategic acquisition or divestment decision involves risks and uncertainties, and we cannot guarantee that any completed or potential transaction or other strategic option, if identified, evaluated and consummated, will provide greater value to our stockholders than that reflected in our current stock price. The success of any completed or potential transaction would be dependent upon a number of factors that may be beyond our control, including, among other factors, market conditions, industry trends and the interest of third parties in our assets, which may be in the early stages of clinical development.\nAny uncertainties related to consummating any future transaction may result in the loss of potential business opportunities and may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners.\nThe results of clinical trials may not support our product candidate claims.\nEven if our clinical trials are completed as planned, we cannot be certain that the results will support regulatory approval of our product candidates. Success in preclinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful, and we cannot be sure that the results of later clinical trials will replicate the results of prior clinical trials and preclinical testing. The clinical trial process may fail to demonstrate that our product candidates are safe for humans and effective for proposed uses. This failure would cause us to abandon a product candidate and may delay development of other product candidates. Any delay in, or termination of, our clinical trials will delay the submission of our NDAs to the FDA or equivalent applications to foreign regulatory authorities and, ultimately, our ability to commercialize our product candidates and generate product revenues. Alternatively, even if we obtain regulatory approval, that approval may be for indications or patient populations that are not as broad as intended or desired or may require labeling that includes significant use or distribution restrictions or safety warnings. We may also be required to perform additional or unanticipated clinical trials to obtain approval or be subject to additional post-marketing testing requirements to maintain regulatory approval. In addition, regulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of the product or impose restrictions on its distribution in the form of a modified REMS. In addition, our clinical trials to date have generally involved small patient populations. Because of the small sample sizes, the results of these clinical trials may not be indicative of future results.\nIn addition, third parties could conduct clinical trials using the product candidates we license. We would have no control over how these trials are conducted and the results could potentially contradict the results we have obtained, or will obtain, from the clinical trials we conduct.\nIf serious adverse or undesirable side effects are identified during the development or commercialization of our product candidates, we may need to abandon our development or commercialization of some of our product candidates or products.\nUndesirable side effects caused by our product candidates could cause us, regulatory authorities, and/or ethics committees to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in a more restrictive label or cause the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other comparable foreign authorities and potential product liability claims. If our product candidates result in undesirable side effects or have characteristics that are unexpected, we may need to abandon their development. Drug-related side effects could affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete the trial or result in potential product liability claims. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly.\nAdditionally, if we or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by TYMLOS, abaloparatide-SC or any product candidate that may receive marketing approval, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:\n\u2022our clinical trials may be put on hold;\n\u2022regulatory authorities may withdraw or limit approvals of such product;\n\u2022regulatory authorities may require additional warnings on the label;\n\u2022regulatory authorities may require us to adopt REMS, which could include a medication guide outlining the risks of such side effects for distribution to patients, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, and other risk minimization tools;\n\u2022regulatory authorities may require us to conduct additional post-market studies, including clinical studies, to assess the safety of the product;\n\u2022we could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients; and\n\u2022our reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the particular product or product candidate and could significantly harm our business, results of operations and prospects.\nAny product candidate for which we have or obtain marketing approval, including TYMLOS, is subject to restrictions or potential withdrawal from the market and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we experience unanticipated problems with our products, when and if any of them are approved.\nTYMLOS and any product candidate for which we have or obtain marketing approval are subject to continuing requirements of and review by the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities. These requirements include, but are not limited to submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration and listing requirements, cGMP requirements relating to quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, and requirements regarding the distribution of drug products, including drug samples to physicians and recordkeeping. Marketing approval of TYMLOS and any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product candidate may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, or contain requirements for costly post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety and/or efficacy of the product.\nThe FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs to ensure drugs are marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. The FDA imposes stringent restrictions on manufacturers\u2019 communications regarding off-label use and, if we market TYMLOS or any of our product candidates which may be approved for other than their approved indications, we may be subject to enforcement action for off-label marketing.\nIn addition, later discovery of previously unknown problems with our products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may yield various results, including:\n\u2022restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of a product, withdrawal of a product from the market, or voluntary or mandatory product recalls;\n\u2022restrictions on the labeling of a product;\n\u2022requirements to conduct post-marketing clinical trials;\n\u2022fines, warning or untitled letters or holds on clinical trials;\n\u2022refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit;\n\u2022suspension or withdrawal of marketing approvals;\n\u2022refusal to permit the import or export of our products;\n\u2022product seizure or detention; or\n\u2022injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nIn addition, the FDA\u2019s policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit, or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature, or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability, which would adversely affect our business.\nThe commercial success of TYMLOS and any product candidates that we may develop and that may be approved will depend upon the degree of market acceptance by regulators, key opinion leaders, physicians, patients, third-party payors, and others in the medical community.\nEven if the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities approve one or more of our product candidates, physicians may not prescribe our products and patients may not use them. Acceptance and use of any of our products will depend upon a number of factors including:\n\u2022perceptions by members of the healthcare community, including physicians and key opinion leaders, about the safety and effectiveness of our drug;\n\u2022the approved indicated uses for our product;\n\u2022the efficacy and safety of the product as demonstrated in clinical trials;\n\u2022cost-effectiveness of our product relative to competing products;\n\u2022the prevalence and severity of adverse side effects;\n\u2022availability and level of coverage and reimbursement by third-party payors, including state and federal governments, pharmacy benefit managers and health insurance plans, the willingness and ability of patients to pay for TYMLOS, and the commensurate discounts, price concessions or rebates required to secure coverage and reimbursement by third-party payors; and\n\u2022effectiveness of marketing and distribution efforts by us and our licensees and distributors, if any.\nIf any product candidate is approved but does not achieve or maintain an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, hospitals, healthcare payors and patients, we may not generate sufficient revenue from these products and we may not become or remain profitable, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur ability to successfully commercialize products depends in part on the extent to which coverage and reimbursement for the costs of our products and related treatments will be available in the United States and worldwide from government authorities and health benefit programs, private health insurers and other organizations.\nOur ability to continue to successfully commercialize TYMLOS or any of our product candidates, if approved, will depend in large part on the scope of coverage and amount of reimbursement by third-party payors. Government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health plans, decide which drugs they will cover and establish reimbursement levels. Coverage and reimbursement may vary among third-party payors. Coverage may not be available, and reimbursement may not be adequate, for our current and any future products that we may develop and commercialize. Also, coverage and reimbursement policies may reduce the demand for, or the price paid for, our products. Patients who are prescribed medications for the treatment of their conditions, and their prescribing physicians, generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with their prescription drugs. Patients are unlikely to use our or our partners\u2019 products unless coverage is provided, and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of such products. Third-party payors may limit coverage or impose conditions on coverage. A third-party payor\u2019s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will apply or patient copayment will be at an acceptable level. In addition, pharmaceutical manufacturers are required by law to offer certain purchasers discounts and rebates and often also need to offer third party payors discounts or rebates on the cost of drugs dispensed to the payors\u2019 members in order to increase the possibility of favorable coverage and adequate cost sharing thresholds for patients. We may be required to provide such rebates to some third-party payors in relation to our product(s). Adequate third-party reimbursement, taking into account such rebates as applicable, may not be available and we may not be able to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate profit, including a return on our investment in product development. See \u201cGovernment Regulation-Pricing and Reimbursement\u201d.\nWe expect to experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of our current and any future products due to the healthcare reforms discussed below, the trend toward initiatives aimed at reducing healthcare costs, the increasing influence of managed care, the scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing, the ongoing debates on reducing government spending and additional legislative proposals. There has been significant scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing and the resulting costs of pharmaceutical products that could cause significant operational and reimbursement changes for the pharmaceutical industry. There have been a number of federal and state efforts to address drug costs, which generally have focused on increasing transparency around drug costs or limiting drug prices, price increases or other related costs. Healthcare reform efforts or any future legislation or regulatory actions aimed at controlling and reducing healthcare costs, including through measures designed to limit reimbursement, restrict access or impose unfavorable pricing modifications on pharmaceutical products, could impact our ability to obtain or maintain reimbursement for our products at satisfactory levels, or at all, which could materially harm our business and financial results.\nDecisions in the European Union on pricing and reimbursement of medicinal products are based upon national rules subject to the control of the Transparency Directive, which aims to ensure the transparency measures established by EU countries to control the pricing and reimbursement of medicinal products. The Transparency Directive defines a series of procedural requirements designed to verify that national pricing and reimbursement decisions do not create obstacles to the pharmaceutical trade within the EU\u2019s Internal Market. The competent authorities of each of the EU Member States have adopted individual policies and rules regulating the pricing and reimbursement of medicinal products in their territory. These national measures controlling pricing and reimbursement often vary widely in nature, scope and application. However, a major element that they have in common is an increased move toward reduction in the reimbursement price of medicinal products, a reduction in the number and type of products selected for reimbursement, and an increased preference for generic products over innovative products. These efforts have mostly been executed through these countries\u2019 existing price-control methodologies, including price cuts, mandatory rebates, value-based pricing, and reference pricing (i.e., referencing prices in other countries and using those reference prices to set a price). It is increasingly common in many EU Member States for Marketing Authorization Holders to be required, in order to obtain support for reimbursement under national health systems and, therefore, practical access to the market to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness or added value benefit of their products as compared to products (which are considered as standard of care) already subject to pricing and reimbursement in specific countries. In order for drugs to be evaluated positively under such criteria, pharmaceutical companies may need to re-examine, and consider altering, a number of traditional functions relating to the selection, study, and management of drugs, whether currently marketed, under development, or being evaluated as candidates for research and/or development.\nFuture legislation, including the current versions being considered at the federal and state level in the United States and at the national level in EU Member States, or regulatory actions implementing recent or future legislation may have a significant\neffect on our business. If government and other healthcare payors do not provide adequate coverage and reimbursement levels for TYMLOS or our product candidates, once approved, market acceptance of our products could be reduced. In addition, negotiating prices with government authorities under current and proposed legislation can delay the commercialization of our product candidates.\nWe may expend resources to pursue a particular product candidate or indication and fail to capitalize on product candidates or indications that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nWe narrowly focus on research programs and product candidates that we identify for specific indications. As a result, we may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with other product candidates or for other indications that later prove to have greater commercial potential. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. Our spending on current and future research and development programs and product candidates for specific indications may not yield any commercially viable products. If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through collaboration, licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such product candidate.\nInterim, \u201ctopline,\u201d and preliminary data from our clinical trials that we announce or publish from time to time may change as more patient data become available and are subject to confirmation, audit, and verification procedures that could result in material changes in the final data.\nFrom time to time, we may publicly disclose preliminary or topline data from our preclinical studies and clinical trials, which is based on a preliminary analysis of then-available data, and the results and related findings and conclusions are subject to change following a more comprehensive review of the data related to the particular study or trial. We also make assumptions, estimations, calculations, and conclusions as part of our analyses of data, and we may not have received or had the opportunity to fully and carefully evaluate all data.\nFurther, others, including regulatory agencies, may not accept or agree with our assumptions, estimates, calculations, conclusions or analyses or may interpret or weigh the importance of data differently, which could impact the potential of the particular program, the likelihood of marketing approval or commercialization of the particular product candidate, any approved product, and our company in general. In addition, the information we choose to publicly disclose regarding a particular study or clinical trial is derived from information that is typically extensive, and you or others may not agree with what we determine is material or otherwise appropriate information to include in our disclosure.\nIf the interim, topline, or preliminary data that we report differ from actual results, or if others, including regulatory authorities, disagree with the conclusions reached, our ability to obtain approval for, and commercialize, our product candidates may be harmed, which could harm our business, operating results, prospects or financial condition.\nIf we experience delays in the enrollment of patients in our clinical trials, our clinical trials and receipt of necessary regulatory approvals could be delayed or prevented.\nWe may not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials for some of our product candidates if we are unable to locate and enroll a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in these trials as required by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities. In addition, many of our competitors have ongoing clinical trials for product candidates that could be competitive with our product candidates, and patients who would otherwise be eligible for our clinical trials may instead enroll in clinical trials of our competitors\u2019 product candidates. In addition, our ability to enroll patients may be significantly delayed by the evolving COVID-19 pandemic and we do not know the extent and scope of such delays at this point.\nEnrollment delays in our clinical trials may result in increased development costs for our product candidates, which would cause the value of our company to decline and limit our ability to obtain additional financing.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is having and is expected to continue to have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including our commercial operations and sales, clinical trials, preclinical studies, and employees.\nThe Coronavirus disease 2019 (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) pandemic continues to evolve, and to date has led to the implementation of various responses, including government-imposed quarantines, travel restrictions, vaccine rollouts and other public health safety measures. It has also had a substantial effect on worldwide economies, causing fluctuations in the capital markets and significant supply chain issues.\nSince March 2020, our employees have worked remotely and will continue to do so indefinitely. We have selectively resumed in-person interactions by our customer-facing personnel in compliance with local and state restrictions. We also continue to engage with customers virtually as we seek to continue to support healthcare professionals and patient care.\nHowever, our ability to engage in personal interactions with physicians and customers remains limited, and it is unknown when in-person interactions will be fully resumed.\nNotwithstanding the various measures we have taken to address the pandemic, COVID-19 could affect the health and availability of our workforce as well as those of the third parties we rely on taking similar measures. If members of our management and other key personnel in critical functions across our organization are unable to perform their duties or have limited availability due to COVID-19, we may not be able to execute on our business strategy and/or our operations may be negatively impacted.\nBusiness interruptions from the current COVID-19, or any future, pandemic may also adversely impact the third parties we solely rely on to sufficiently manufacture TYMLOS and to produce our product candidates in quantities we require, which may adversely impact the commercialization of TYMLOS and our research and development activities and potential commercialization of our product candidates.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic could worsen in countries that are afflicted with COVID-19, could continue to spread to additional countries, or could return to countries where the pandemic has been partially contained, each of which could further adversely impact our ability to commercialize TYMLOS, or conduct clinical trials and our business generally, and could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial condition and results. In addition, the trading prices for our common stock and other biopharmaceutical companies have been, and will likely continue to be, highly volatile as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and may limit our ability to raise additional capital.\nSeparately, in response to the global pandemic of COVID-19, on March 10, 2020, the FDA announced its intention to postpone most foreign inspections of manufacturing facilities and products through April 2020, and subsequently, on March 18, 2020, the FDA announced its intention to temporarily postpone routine surveillance inspections of domestic manufacturing facilities. In July 2021, the FDA stated that it had begun transitioning back to standard operations for domestic inspections, while continuing to prioritize mission-critical work for foreign inspections. However, further delays or setbacks are possible in the future. As a result, review, inspection, and other timelines for our product candidates may be materially delayed for an unknown period of time. Regulatory authorities outside the U.S. may adopt similar restrictions or other policy measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. If a prolonged government shutdown occurs, or if global health concerns continue to prevent the FDA or other regulatory authorities from conducting their regular inspections, reviews, or other regulatory activities, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA or other regulatory authorities to timely review and process our marketing applications, clinical trial authorizations, or other regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will directly or indirectly impact our business, results of operations and financial condition will inevitably depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning COVID-19, such as the existence of additional variants of the disease, the actions taken to contain it or treat its impact and the economic impact on local, regional, and national markets.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties\nWe currently rely on third parties to manufacture TYMLOS and to produce our product candidates; our dependence on these parties, including any inability on our part to accurately anticipate product demand and timely secure manufacturing capacity to meet commercial or clinical product demand may impair the commercialization of TYMLOS and the research and development activities and potential commercialization of our product candidates.\nWe have no experience in drug formulation or manufacturing and do not intend to establish our own manufacturing facilities. We lack the resources and expertise to internally formulate or manufacture TYMLOS or our product candidates in the quantities needed to meet commercial demand for TYMLOS, or to internally conduct our research and development activities and clinical trials for our product candidates. Therefore, we rely on, and expect to continue relying on for the foreseeable future, a limited number of third parties to manufacture and supply materials (including raw materials and subunits), drug substance, or API, and drug product, as well as to perform additional steps in the manufacturing process, such as filling, labeling, and storage of TYMLOS and our product candidates. This reliance on third parties increases the risk that we do not have sufficient quantities of our product candidates or products or such quantities at an acceptable cost or quality, which could delay, prevent or impair our development or commercialization efforts.\nWe have entered into agreements with contract manufacturers to manufacture TYMLOS in the quantities needed to meet commercial demand and our product candidates for use in research and development activities and clinical trials. These contract manufacturers are currently our only source for the production and formulation of TYMLOS and our product candidates. If our contract manufacturers are unable to produce, in a timely manner, adequate supplies of TYMLOS or our product candidates to meet our needs, we would be required to seek new contract manufacturers that may require us to modify our finished product formulation and modify or terminate our clinical studies. Any modification of our finished product or modification or termination of our clinical studies could adversely affect the commercial potential of TYMLOS or any product candidate that\nmay be approved and impair our ability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals, which would materially harm our business and impair our ability to raise capital.\nIn addition, the facilities and processes and controls used by our contract manufacturers to manufacture TYMLOS and our product candidates must be approved by the EMA and by the FDA pursuant to inspections that will be conducted following our regulatory approval submissions. We do not control the facilities or manufacturing process and are completely dependent on our contract manufacturing partners for compliance with cGMPs for manufacture of both active drug substances and finished drug products. If our contract manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA or other regulatory authorities, they will not be able to secure and/or maintain regulatory approval for their manufacturing facilities. In addition, we have no control over the ability of our contract manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel. If the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority does not approve our contract manufacturers for the manufacture of our product candidates or if they withdraw any such approval in the future, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which would significantly impact our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for or market, with respect to TYMLOS, or for our product candidates, if approved.\nWe depend on a number of single source contract manufacturers to supply key components of abaloparatide. For example, we depend on PPL, which has agreed to produce supplies of abaloparatide API to support the abaloparatide-SC and abaloparatide-TD clinical studies and the commercial supplies of TYMLOS. We also depend on Vetter and Ypsomed for the production of finished drug product clinical and commercial supplies of TYMLOS, Kindeva for the production of abaloparatide-TD. If our relationship with any of these contract manufacturers is terminated, or if they are unable to produce abaloparatide or related components in required quantities, on a timely basis or at all, and/or in compliance with the terms of our agreements, our business and financial condition would be materially harmed. Because the manufacturing process for abaloparatide-TD requires the use of Kindeva's proprietary technology, Kindeva is the sole source for supplies of abaloparatide-TD.\nOur anticipated future reliance on a limited number of third-party manufacturers exposes us to the following risks, among others:\n\u2022We may be unable to identify manufacturers on acceptable terms, or at all, because the number of potential manufacturers is limited and the FDA must inspect any manufacturers for cGMP compliance as part of our application.\n\u2022A new manufacturer would have to be educated in, or develop substantially equivalent processes for, production of our products after receipt of FDA approval, if any.\n\u2022Our third-party manufacturers might be unable to formulate and manufacture our drugs or related components in the volume and of the quality required to meet our clinical needs and commercial needs.\n\u2022Our contract manufacturers may not perform as agreed or may not remain in the contract manufacturing business for the time required.\n\u2022Manufacturers are subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspection by the FDA and corresponding state agencies to ensure strict compliance with cGMP, and other government regulations and corresponding foreign standards, and we do not have control over third-party manufacturers\u2019 compliance with these regulations and standards.\n\u2022We may not own, or may have to share, the intellectual property rights to any improvements made by our third-party manufacturers in the manufacturing process for our product candidates.\n\u2022Our third-party manufacturers may be subject to litigation or arbitration with respect to the manufacturing and supply of our products, including claims of intellectual property infringement by third parties.\nEach of these risks could delay our clinical trials, the approval of our product candidates by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities or the commercialization of TYMLOS or any of our product candidates that may be approved or result in higher costs or deprive us of potential product revenues.\nOur drug development programs depend upon third-party researchers, investigators and collaborators who are outside our control.\nWe depend upon independent researchers, investigators and collaborators, to conduct our preclinical studies and clinical trials under agreements with us. These third parties are not our employees and we cannot control the amount or timing of resources that they devote to our programs. We and our third-party researchers, investigators and collaborators are required to comply with good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements, which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA, the Competent Authorities of the Member States of the European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d), and comparable foreign regulatory authorities for all of our products in clinical development. Regulatory authorities enforce these GCPs through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and trial sites. If we or any of these third parties fail to comply with applicable GCPs, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA, EMA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing\napplications or require a more restrictive label for the product. We cannot assure you that upon inspection by a given regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that any of our clinical trials comply with GCP regulations. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with product produced under cGMP regulations. Our or our contract manufacturers\u2019 failure to comply with these regulations may delay ongoing or planned clinical trials or require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process. Failure by us or by third parties we engage to comply with regulatory requirements can also result in fines, adverse publicity, and civil and criminal sanctions. Moreover, our business may be implicated if any of these third parties violates federal or state fraud and abuse or false claims laws and regulations or healthcare privacy and security laws. If outside collaborators fail to devote sufficient time and resources to our drug-development programs, or if their performance is substandard, the approval of our FDA or foreign regulatory authority applications, if any, and our introduction of new drugs, if any, will be delayed. These collaborators may also have relationships with other commercial entities, some of whom may compete with us. If our collaborators assist competitors at our expense, our competitive position would be harmed.\nWe have entered into, and in the future may enter into, licenses and/or collaborations with third parties for the development and commercialization of our product candidates. If those licenses and/or collaborations, are not successful, we may not be able to capitalize on the market potential of these product candidates.\nWe have in the past, currently have, and may in the future, seek third-party licensees and/or collaborators for the development and commercialization of some of our products and product candidates on a selective basis. Our likely licensees and/or collaborators for any arrangements include large and mid-size pharmaceutical companies, regional and national pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies.\nTo the extent we have, and if we do enter into any further such arrangements with any third parties, we will likely have limited control over the amount and timing of resources that our licensees and/or collaborators dedicate to such development or commercialization activities. Our ability to generate revenues from our license and/or collaboration arrangements will depend on our licensees\u2019 and/or collaborators\u2019 abilities and efforts to successfully perform the functions assigned to them in these arrangements. Licenses and collaborations involving our product candidates would pose numerous risks to us, including the following:\n\u2022licensees and/or collaborators have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these arrangements and may not perform their obligations as expected;\n\u2022licensees and/or collaborators may deemphasize or not pursue development and commercialization of our products or product candidates or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs based on clinical trial results, changes in their strategic focus, or available funding or external factors such as an acquisition that diverts resources or creates competing priorities;\n\u2022licensees and/or collaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial program, stop a clinical trial or abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new formulation of a product candidate for clinical testing;\n\u2022licensees and/or collaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with our products or product candidates if they believe that competitive products are more likely to be successfully developed or can be commercialized under terms that are more economically attractive than ours; license or collaboration arrangements may subject us to exclusivity provisions which could restrict our ability to compete in certain territories, including those licensed to the licensee and/or collaborator;\n\u2022a licensee or collaborator with marketing and distribution rights to multiple products may not commit sufficient resources to the marketing and distribution of our product relative to other products;\n\u2022licensees or collaborators may not properly obtain, maintain, defend or enforce our intellectual property rights or may use our proprietary information and intellectual property in such a way as to invite litigation or other intellectual property related proceedings that could jeopardize or invalidate our proprietary information and intellectual property or expose us to potential litigation or other intellectual property related proceedings;\n\u2022disputes may arise between the licensees and/or collaborators and us that result in the delay or termination of the research, development or commercialization of our products or product candidates or that result in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts management attention and resources;\n\u2022licenses and/or collaborations may be terminated and, if terminated, may result in a need for additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable product candidates;\n\u2022license and/or collaboration agreements may not lead to development or commercialization of product candidates in the most efficient manner or at all; and\n\u2022if a licensee or collaborator of ours were to be involved in a business combination, the continued pursuit and emphasis on our product development or commercialization program could be delayed, diminished or terminated.\nIf our license or collaboration arrangements are not successful, our business, financial condition, results of operations, prospects and development and commercialization efforts may be adversely affected. Any termination or expiration of our\nlicense or collaboration agreements could adversely affect us financially or harm our business reputation, development and commercialization efforts.\nRisks Related to Marketing and Sale of Our Products\nIf we are unable to maintain appropriate and effective commercial capabilities on our own or through partnerships or collaborations, we may not be able to continue to successfully commercialize TYMLOS or any of our product candidates or generate product revenue.\nWe established an internal sales force to market and sell TYMLOS in the United States to specialists and continue to pursue collaborative arrangements to market and sell abaloparatide-SC outside of the United States. Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to enter into and maintain collaborative relationships for such capabilities, the collaborators\u2019 or partners\u2019 strategic interest in our products and product candidates and such collaborators\u2019 or partners\u2019 ability to successfully develop, market, and sell any such products.\nIn addition, our ability to maintain effective commercial, medical affairs, marketing, sales, market access, managerial and other non-technical capabilities will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to:\n\u2022identify, recruit, hire, train, incentivize and retain commercial and medical affairs personnel, including a sales force with appropriate technical expertise;\n\u2022train our sales representatives, to deliver clear and compelling messages within the scope of the approved labeling and in accordance with other applicable FDA requirements regarding TYMLOS, or any of our product candidates that may be approved, and to be credible and persuasive in educating physicians on the appropriate situations to consider prescribing as set forth in the approved labeling;\n\u2022ensure our commercial customer-facing team, including sales, market access, and field logistics professionals, effectively build relationships with their respective customers;\n\u2022manage a geographically dispersed national commercial customer-facing organization; and\n\u2022manage our growth and the integration of new personnel.\nIf we cannot compete successfully against other drug companies, we may not achieve sufficient product revenues and our business will suffer.\nThe market for our products and product candidates is characterized by intense competition and rapid technological advances. TYMLOS and any of our product candidates that may receive FDA or foreign regulatory authority approval will compete with a number of existing and future drugs and therapies developed, manufactured and marketed by others. Existing or future competing products may provide greater therapeutic convenience or clinical or other benefits for a specific indication than our products, or may offer comparable performance at a lower cost. If TYMLOS or any of our potential products fail to capture and maintain market share, we may not achieve sufficient product revenues and our business will suffer.\nTYMLOS competes in the U.S. against well-known treatment options, including teriparatide, marketed by Lilly in the U.S. as Forteo. TYMLOS may also face competition from generic or biosimilar versions of teriparatide. The availability of a generic or biosimilar teriparatide on the market would likely exert pricing and reimbursement pressure on the anabolic class in which TYMLOS competes. In order to compete successfully, we will have to demonstrate to patients, physicians and third-party payors that treatment with TYMLOS is worthwhile and is a better alternative to existing or new therapies.\nWe may also face competition from companies that seek to market generic versions of TYMLOS through an Abbreviated New Drug Application (\u201cANDA\u201d).\nWe face significant competition from many fully integrated pharmaceutical companies and smaller companies that are collaborating with larger pharmaceutical companies, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations. Many of these competitors have compounds already approved or in development. In addition, many of these competitors, either alone or together with their collaborative partners, operate larger research and development programs or have substantially greater financial resources than we do, as well as significantly greater experience in:\n\u2022developing drugs;\n\u2022undertaking preclinical testing and human clinical trials;\n\u2022obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of drugs;\n\u2022formulating and manufacturing drugs; and\n\u2022launching, marketing, distributing, and selling drugs.\nDevelopments by competitors may render our products or technologies obsolete or non-competitive.\nThe biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. Our product TYMLOS, and our product candidates, if approved, will or may compete against new or existing therapies. In addition, a large number of companies are pursuing the development of pharmaceuticals that target the same diseases and conditions that we are targeting. We face competition from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in the United States and abroad. In addition, companies doing business in different but related fields represent substantial competition. Many of these organizations competing with us have substantially greater capital resources, larger research and development staffs and facilities, longer drug development history in obtaining regulatory approvals, and greater manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we do. These organizations also compete with us to attract qualified personnel and parties for acquisitions, joint ventures or other collaborations, and therefore, we may not be able to hire or retain qualified personnel to run all facets of our business. These risks could render our products or technologies obsolete or non-competitive.\nWe may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of our products in response to product liability lawsuits.\nThe testing and marketing of medical products entail an inherent risk of product liability. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization of our products. Our inability to obtain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable cost to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of pharmaceutical products we develop, alone or with collaborators.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations in our intellectual property licenses with third parties, we could lose license rights that are important to our business.\nWe are a party to a number of intellectual property license agreements with third parties and expect to enter into additional license agreements in the future. Our existing license agreements impose, and we expect that any future license agreements will impose, various diligence, milestone payment, royalty, insurance and other obligations on us. If we fail to comply with these obligations, our licensors may have the right to terminate these agreements, in which event we might not be able to develop and market any product that is covered by these agreements. Termination of these licenses or reduction or elimination of our licensed rights may result in our having to negotiate new or reinstated licenses with less favorable terms. The occurrence of such events could materially harm our business.\nIf our efforts to protect our intellectual property related to TYMLOS/abaloparatide-SC, and/or our other current or future product candidates fail to adequately protect these assets or if we are unable to secure all necessary intellectual property, we may lose the ability to license or successfully commercialize one or more of these products or product candidates.\nOur commercial success is significantly dependent on intellectual property related to our portfolio of product and product candidates. We are either the licensee or assignee of numerous issued and pending patent applications that cover various aspects of our assets, including TYMLOS/abaloparatide-SC, and our other product candidates. We could encounter challenges or difficulties in maintaining and/or defending our intellectual property both in the United States and abroad.\nWe and Ipsen are also co-assignees to U.S. Patent No. 7,803,770 that we believe provides exclusivity until April 28, 2031 for abaloparatide-SC. We and Ipsen are also co-assignees to U.S. Patent Nos. 8,148,333 and 8,748,382 for the therapeutic formulation for abaloparatide-SC that we believe provides exclusivity until November 8, 2027 and October 3, 2027, respectively.\nWe and Kindeva are co-assignees to several foreign and corresponding U.S. patents and patent applications, which cover various aspects of abaloparatide for microneedle application. Any issued patents resulting from these applications will have a statutory expiration date of 2036, not taking into account extension under any applicable laws. However, pending patent applications in the United States and elsewhere may not issue since the interpretation of the legal requirements of patentability in view of claimed inventions are not always predictable. Additional intellectual property covering abaloparatide-TD technology exists in the form of proprietary information protected as trade secrets. These can be accidentally disclosed to, independently derived by or misappropriated by competitors, possibly reducing or eliminating the exclusivity advantages of this form of intellectual property, thereby allowing those competitors more rapid entry into the marketplace with a competitive product, which reduces our advantage with abaloparatide-TD. In addition, trade secrets may in some instances become publicly available through required disclosures in regulatory files. Alternatively, competitors may sometimes reverse engineer a product once it becomes available on the market. Even where a competitor does not use an identical technology for the delivery of abaloparatide, it is possible that they could achieve an equivalent or even superior result using another technology. Such occurrences could lead to either one or more alternative competitor products becoming available on the market and/or one or\nmore generic competitor products on the market gaining market share and causing a corresponding decrease in market share and/or price for abaloparatide-TD even if it were to be successfully developed and approved by the FDA.\nSince patents are technical legal documents that are frequently subject to intense litigation pressure, there is risk that even if one or more patents related to our products does issue and is asserted in litigation, it is possible that the patent(s) will be found invalid, unenforceable and/or not infringed in the course of that litigation or other proceedings. Finally, the intellectual property laws and practices can vary considerably from one country to another and also can change with time. As a result, we could encounter challenges or difficulties in building, maintaining and defending our intellectual property both in the United States and abroad.\nWe may become party to, or threatened with, future adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding intellectual property rights with respect to patents issued or licensed to us, including interference proceedings or post grant or inter partes reviews, reexaminations, or other proceedings before the USPTO. Third parties also may assert infringement claims against us in courts in various jurisdictions. If we are found to infringe a third-party's intellectual property rights, we could be required to obtain a license from such third-party to continue developing and marketing our products and technology. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. We could be forced, including by court order, to cease commercializing the infringing technology or product. In addition, we could be found liable for monetary damages. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing our product candidates or force us to cease some of our business operations, which could materially harm our business. Claims that we have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties could have a similar negative impact on our business.\nOur trademarks are considered to be material to our business. These trademarks are covered by registrations or pending applications for registration in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and in other countries. Trademark protection continues in some countries for as long as the mark is used and, in other countries, for as long as it is registered. Registrations generally are for fixed, but renewable, terms. We cannot assure you that the trademark protection that we have pursued or will pursue in the future will afford us significant commercial protection.\nTrade secret protection is available only for trade secrets as defined by applicable laws. Trade secret laws may vary depending upon the jurisdiction and various statutes. Trade secrets do not prevent reverse engineering by competitors. We cannot assure you that information that we have sought or will seek to maintain secret is or will be a trade secret under the applicable law or will afford us significant commercial protection.\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for our technology and products, or if our licensors are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for the technology or products that we license from them, our competitors could develop and commercialize technology and products similar or identical to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our technology and products may be adversely affected.\nOur success depends in large part on our and our licensors' ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in the United States and other countries with respect to our proprietary technology and products. In some circumstances, we may not have the right to control the preparation, filing and prosecution of patent applications, or to maintain the patents, covering technology or products that we license from third parties. Therefore, we cannot be certain that these patents and applications will be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business. In addition, if third parties who license patents to us fail to maintain these patents, or lose rights to those patents, the rights we have licensed may be reduced or eliminated.\nThe patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has in recent years been the subject of much litigation. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our and our licensors' patent rights are highly uncertain. Our and our licensors' pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued that protect our technology or products or that effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection. The laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Assuming the other requirements for patentability are met, in the United States, prior to March 16, 2013, the first to make the claimed invention was entitled to the patent, or a \"first-to-invent\" system, while outside the United States, the first to file a patent application is entitled to the patent, or a \"first-to-file\" system. With the implementation of the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, the United States now has a first-to-file system for patent applications filed on or after March 16, 2013. We may become involved in opposition, interference or derivation proceedings challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all.\nTherefore, we cannot be certain that we or our licensors were the first to make the inventions claimed in our owned and licensed patents or pending patent applications, or that we or our licensors were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. An adverse determination in any such proceeding could reduce the scope of, or invalidate our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our technology or products and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize products without infringing third-party patent rights.\nEven if our owned and licensed patent applications issue as patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection, prevent competitors from competing with us or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. Our competitors may be able to circumvent our owned or licensed patents by developing similar or alternative technologies or products in a non-infringing manner. The issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its scope, validity or enforceability, and our owned and licensed patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. Any challenges may result in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, which could limit our ability to stop or prevent us from stopping others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and products. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are approved or commercialized. As a result, our owned and licensed patents may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours.\nOf particular concern for a company like ours, having one marketed product, is that third parties may seek to market generic versions of TYMLOS by filing an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) Application with the FDA in which they claim that patents protecting TYMLOS owned or licensed by us and listed with the FDA in what is called \"the Orange Book\" are invalid, unenforceable and/or not infringed, a so-called Paragraph IV filing. April 28, 2021 is the first opportunity under United States law for a generic company to file an ANDA and make a Paragraph IV filing. If such a filing is made, we may need to defend and/or assert our patents, including by filing lawsuits against the Paragraph IV filer alleging patent infringement. In any of these types of proceedings, a court or other agency with jurisdiction may find our patents invalid, not infringed and/or unenforceable, which would have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. During the period in which such litigation is pending, the uncertainty of its outcome may cause investors to disfavor our stock, and our stock price could decline. Even if we are successful in prosecuting such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nPatent terms may be inadequate to protect our competitive position on our product candidates for an adequate amount of time.\nPatents have a limited lifespan. In the United States, if all maintenance fees are timely paid, the unadjusted or unextended expiration of a patent is generally 20 years from its earliest U.S. non-provisional filing date. Various extensions may be available, but the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. Even if patents covering our product candidates are obtained, once the patent life has expired for a product candidate, we may be open to competition from competitive medications, including generic medications. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such product candidates might expire before or shortly after such product candidates are commercialized. As a result, our owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing product candidates similar or identical to ours for a meaningful amount of time, or at all.\nThe primary composition of matter patent covering TYMLOS in the United States and several additional countries has expired. We own or have licensed rights to a limited number of patents directed toward methods of treating osteoporosis with the therapeutic dose for TYMLOS and for the therapeutic formulation of TYMLOS. We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications for TYMLOS, our other drug candidates, or our research technologies or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future; nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting TYMLOS, our other drug candidates or our other technology.\nPayments, fees, submissions and various additional requirements must be met in order for pending patent applications to advance in prosecution and issued patents to be maintained. Rigorous compliance with these requirements is essential to procurement and maintenance of patents integral to our product portfolio.\nPeriodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and various other governmental fees on patents and/or patent applications will come due for payment periodically throughout the lifecycle of patent applications and issued patents. In order to help ensure that we comply with any required fee payment, documentary and/or procedural requirements as they might relate to any patents for which we are an assignee or co-assignee, we employ competent legal help and related professionals as needed to comply with those requirements. Our outside patent counsel uses third parties for patent annuity payments. Failure to meet a required fee payment, document production or procedural requirement can result in the abandonment of a pending patent application or the lapse of an issued patent. In some instances, the defect can be cured through late compliance but there are\nsituations where the failure to meet the required event cannot be cured. Any failures could compromise the intellectual property protection around our preclinical or clinical candidates and possibly weaken or eliminate our ability to protect our eventual market share for that product.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed.\nIn addition to our patented technology and products, we rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information, to maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect these trade secrets, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties that have access to our trade secrets, such as our corporate collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties. We also enter into confidentiality and invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and consultants. However, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for any breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to, or independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position would be harmed.\nIf we infringe the rights of third parties, we could be prevented from selling products and could be forced to pay damages and defend against litigation.\nIf our products, methods, processes and other technologies infringe the proprietary rights of other parties, we could incur substantial costs and may have to:\n\u2022obtain licenses, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all;\n\u2022abandon an infringing drug candidate;\n\u2022redesign our products or processes to avoid infringement;\n\u2022stop using the subject matter claimed in the patents held by others;\n\u2022pay damages; or\n\u2022defend litigation or administrative proceedings which may be costly whether we win or lose, which could result in a substantial diversion of our financial and management resources.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents or misappropriate our trademarks or trade secrets. To counter infringement, misappropriation, or unauthorized use, we may be required to file proceedings, which can be expensive and time consuming. In addition, in such a proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours is invalid and/or unenforceable, confidential information is not a trade secret under the appropriate statute or was not misappropriated, a trademark was not protectable or misappropriated, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation proceeding could put one or more of our patents or other intellectual property rights at risk, such as by of being invalidated and/or interpreted narrowly. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. In addition, our licensors may have rights to file and prosecute these types of claims, and we may be reliant on them to do so.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers.\nSome of our employees were previously employed at universities or other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although we try to ensure that our employees do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or these employees have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such employee's former employer. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nIntellectual property litigation could cause us to spend substantial resources and distract our personnel from their normal responsibilities.\nEven if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses and could distract our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities, delaying the development of our product candidates. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments, and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Litigation or other proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce our resources available for development activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to adequately conduct any litigation or proceedings. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of any litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their substantially greater financial resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace.\nRisks Related to Legislation and Administrative Actions\nHealthcare reform may have a material adverse effect on our industry and our results of operations.\nIn the U.S., federal and state governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to reform delivery of, or payment for, health care, which include initiatives to reduce the cost of healthcare. For example, in March 2010, the U.S. Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (the \u201cHealthcare Reform Act\u201d), which expanded health care coverage through Medicaid expansion, implemented the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d for health insurance coverage (by imposing a tax penalty on individuals who did not obtain insurance) and changed the coverage and reimbursement of drug products under government healthcare programs.\nBased upon efforts by the Trump administration, there have been ongoing attempts to modify or repeal all or certain provisions of the Healthcare Reform Act. For example, tax reform legislation was enacted at the end of 2017 that eliminated the tax penalty established under the Healthcare Reform Act for individuals who do not maintain mandated health insurance coverage beginning in 2019. The Healthcare Reform Act has also been subject to judicial challenge. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the latest judicial challenge to the Healthcare Reform Act brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the Healthcare Reform Act.\nBeyond the Healthcare Reform Act, there have been ongoing health care reform efforts. Some recent healthcare reform efforts have sought to address certain issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including an expansion of telehealth coverage under Medicare and accelerated or advanced Medicare payments to healthcare providers. Other reform efforts affect pricing or payment for drug products. For example, the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program has been subject to statutory and regulatory changes and the discount that manufacturers of Medicare Part D brand name drugs must provide to Medicare Part D beneficiaries during the coverage gap increased from 50% to 70%. Additional reform efforts are likely. The Biden administration has focused on reforms that would address the high cost of drugs. In response to an Executive Order from President Biden, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services issued a comprehensive plan for addressing high drug prices that describes a number of legislative approaches and identifies administrative tools to address the high cost of drugs. In addition, Democrats included drug pricing reform provisions reflecting elements of the plan in a broader proposed spending package in late 2021 - such as capping Medicare Part D patients out-of-pocket costs; establishing penalties for drug prices that increase faster than inflation in Medicare; and authorizing the federal government to negotiate prices on certain, select high cost drugs under Medicare Parts B and D.\nHealthcare reform efforts have been and may continue to be subject to scrutiny and legal challenge. For example, revisions to regulations under the federal anti-kickback statute would remove protection for traditional Medicare Part D discounts offered by pharmaceutical manufacturers to pharmacy benefit managers and health plans. Pursuant to court order, the removal was delayed and recent legislation imposed a moratorium on implementation of the rule until January 1, 2026.\nThere have also been efforts by government officials or legislators to implement measures to regulate prices or payment for pharmaceutical products, including legislation on drug importation. Recently, there has been considerable public and government scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing and proposals to address the perceived high cost of pharmaceuticals. There have also been recent state legislative efforts to address drug costs, which generally have focused on increasing transparency around drug costs or limiting drug prices. Adoption of new legislation regulating drug pricing at the federal or state level could further affect demand for, or pricing of, our products.\nGeneral legislative cost control measures may also affect reimbursement for our products. The Budget Control Act of 2011, as amended, resulted in the imposition of 2% reductions in Medicare (but not Medicaid) payments to providers in 2013 and remains in effect through 2030 (except May 1, 2020 to March 31, 2022) unless additional Congressional action is taken. Any significant spending reductions affecting Medicare, Medicaid or other publicly funded or subsidized health programs that may be implemented and/or any significant taxes or fees that may be imposed on us could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nThe full impact on our business of these laws, or future laws and regulations is uncertain. We cannot predict whether other legislative or administrative changes will be adopted, if any, or how such changes would affect the pharmaceutical industry generally or our business in particular.\nWe expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product candidates once approved or additional pricing pressures, and may adversely affect our operating results. Such legislation may also reduce our flexibility in setting prices for our product candidates, or in taking price increases.\nWe are subject to healthcare laws, regulation and enforcement, and our failure to comply with those laws could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial conditions.\nOur business operations and current and future arrangements with investigators, healthcare professionals, consultants, third-party payors, patient organizations and customers, may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations now or in the future. These laws may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we conduct our operations, including how we research, market, sell and distribute our product candidates, if approved. Within the U.S., such laws include:\n\u2022The federal anti-kickback statute makes it illegal for any person or entity to knowingly and willfully, directly or indirectly, solicit, receive, offer, or pay any remuneration that is in exchange for or to induce the referral of business, including the purchase, order, lease of any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. The term \u201cremuneration\u201d has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value.\n\u2022Federal false claims and false statement laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to, or approval by, federal programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, claims for items or services, including drugs, that are false or fraudulent.\n\u2022The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\u201cHIPAA\u201d), as amended, which prohibits executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private health plans, or making false statements relating to healthcare matters and which also imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information on certain types of entities, which include many healthcare providers and health plans with which we interact;\n\u2022The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which among other things, strictly regulates drug product and medical device marketing, prohibits manufacturers from marketing such products prior to approval or for unapproved indications and regulates the distribution of samples;\n\u2022Federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers;\n\u2022Federal laws, including the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, that require pharmaceutical manufacturers to report certain calculated product prices to the government or provide certain discounts or rebates to government authorities or private entities, often as a condition of reimbursement under government healthcare programs; and\n\u2022The so-called \u201cfederal sunshine\u201d law, which requires pharmaceutical and medical device companies to monitor and report certain financial interactions with physicians, certain non-physician practitioners and teaching hospitals to the federal government for re-disclosure to the public.\nAlso, many states have similar laws and regulations, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws that may be broader in scope and may apply to claims reimbursed by private payors as well as government programs or regardless of reimbursement. Additionally, we may be subject to state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the federal government\u2019s and/or pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines, impose specific restrictions on interactions between pharmaceutical companies and healthcare providers or require pharmaceutical companies to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures. Other state laws may require pharmaceutical companies to file reports relating to pricing and marketing information and state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives. Finally, there are state laws governing the privacy and security of health information, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA. Many of these laws and regulations also contain ambiguous requirements or require administrative guidance for implementation.\nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. Given the breadth of the laws and regulations, limited guidance for certain laws and regulations and evolving government interpretations of the laws and regulations, governmental authorities may possibly conclude that our operations and commercial activities in connection with TYMLOS or any product candidate that may be approved may not comply with such laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other\ngovernmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Further, defending against any such actions can be costly, time-consuming and may require significant personnel resources. Therefore, even if we are successful in defending against any such actions that may be brought against us, our business may be impaired.\nWe may be exposed to liability claims associated with the use of hazardous materials and chemicals.\nOur research and development activities may involve the controlled use of hazardous materials and chemicals. Although we believe that our safety procedures for using, storing, handling and disposing of these materials comply with federal, state and local laws and regulations, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental injury or contamination from these materials. In the event of such an accident, we could be held liable for any resulting damages and any liability could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous or radioactive materials and waste products may require us to incur substantial compliance costs that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRecent decisions from the European General Court on public access to clinical trial data held by the EMA could result in disclosure of our pre-clinical and clinical trial data to competitors, or other third parties, which could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn the EU, Regulation 1049/2001/EC, commonly known as the EU Freedom of Information Regulation or Public Access Regulation (the \u201cTransparency Regulation\u201d), allows any EU citizens and any natural or legal persons residing or having their headquarters in an EU country to request access to the documents held by a EU institution on grounds relating to public interest. The Transparency Regulation applies to the EMA, which has implemented the provisions in its established policy. The EMA policy favors public access, subject to certain limited exceptions if disclosure undermines, among others, the protection of commercial interests. The EMA policy has been the subject of a number of recent rulings of the EU General Court in the following cases: Pari Pharma GmbH v EMA (Case T-235/1); MSD Animal Health Innovation and Intervet International v EMA(Case T-729/15); PTC Therapeutics International v EMA (Case T-718/15); Intercept Pharma and Intercept Pharmaceuticals v EMA (Case T-377/18); and Amicus Therapeutics UK and Amicus Therapeutics v EMA (Case T-33/17). These decisions responded to demands for greater transparency and disclosure of pre-clinical and clinical data and validated the EMA\u2019s transparency policy to provide greater public access to information held and documents drawn up by the EMA. These decisions clarified that there is no presumption of confidentiality of documents held by the EMA, that the potential risk of misuse of the data by a competitor is not relevant to an assessment of confidentiality under the Transparency Regulation and the argument that data exclusivity or protection in countries outside the EU may be lost due to use of the disclosed documents does not make the data in question confidential. In two of these cases, the rulings of the General Court were appealed to the Court of Justice of the European Union (Cases C-178/18 P - MSD Animal Health Innovation and Intervet International v EMA and C-175/18 P - PTC Therapeutics International v EMA). The Court of Justice upheld the rulings of the General Court and dismissed the appeals.\nThe potential risk to our business under the Transparency Regulation is significant. For example, our marketing authorisation application for abaloparatide-SC in the EU was reviewed centrally by the EMA and its advisory committees, which application was rejected in January 2019. According to the established EMA policy, the information contained in our marketing authorisation application, responses we provided to the questions raised by the EMA and its advisory committees as well as the assessment reports drawn up by the EMA and its advisory committees were not disclosed during the course of the EMA\u2019s review. However, now that the EMA has completed its review of our marketing application, such information may now be susceptible to disclosure to third parties, including to our competitors, in light of the recent rulings of the General Court and the Court of Justice in relation to the Transparency Regulation. The potential disclosure of such information to third parties, including our competitors, and the potential loss of data exclusivity or protections in countries outside the EU could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nThe EMA has also implemented a policy for the proactive publication of clinical data submitted by pharmaceutical companies to support their applications for marketing authorization. The implementation of this policy is currently suspended due to Brexit and the relocation of the EMA to the Netherlands. While, due to this suspension, the clinical data contained in our application for marketing authorization for abaloparatide-SC in the EU was not published, such proactive publication by the EMA cannot be excluded should the implementation of the EMA policy for the proactive publication of clinical data be resumed by the EMA.\nWe are subject to anti-corruption laws, as well as export control laws, customs laws, sanctions laws and other laws governing our operations. If we fail to comply with these laws, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, other remedial measures and legal expenses, be precluded from developing manufacturing and selling certain products outside the\nUnited States or be required to develop and implement costly compliance programs, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur operations are subject to anti-corruption laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d), the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, or Bribery Act, and other anti-corruption laws that apply in countries where we do business and may do business in the future. The FCPA, Bribery Act and these other laws generally prohibit us, our officers, and our employees and intermediaries from bribing, being bribed or making other prohibited payments to government officials or other persons to obtain or retain business or gain some other business advantage. Compliance with the FCPA, in particular, is expensive and difficult, particularly in countries in which corruption is a recognized problem. In addition, the FCPA presents particular challenges in the pharmaceutical industry, because, in many countries, hospitals are operated by the government, and doctors and other hospital employees are considered foreign officials. Certain payments to hospitals in connection with clinical trials and other work have been deemed to be improper payments to government officials. Our clinical trials are conducted around the world, and our payments to hospitals may lead to FCPA enforcement actions.\nThough we currently do not have any partners that commercialize our products in other countries, we may in the future operate in jurisdictions that pose a high risk of potential FCPA or Bribery Act violations, and we may participate in collaborations and relationships with third parties whose actions could potentially subject us to liability under the FCPA, Bribery Act or local anti-corruption laws. In addition, we cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted. If we expand our operations outside of the United States, we will need to dedicate additional resources to comply with numerous laws and regulations in each jurisdiction in which we plan to operate.\nWe are also subject to other laws and regulations governing our international operations, including regulations administered by the governments of the UK and the United States, and authorities in the EU Member States, including applicable export control regulations, economic sanctions on countries and persons, customs requirements and currency exchange regulations, collectively referred to as the Trade Control laws. In addition, various laws, regulations and executive orders also restrict the use and dissemination outside of the United States, or the sharing with certain non-U.S. nationals, of information classified for national security purposes, as well as certain products and technical data relating to those products. If we expand our presence outside of the United States, it will require us to dedicate additional resources to comply with these laws, and these laws may preclude us from developing, manufacturing, or selling certain products and product candidates outside of the United States, which could limit our growth potential and increase our development costs.\nThere is no assurance that we will be completely effective in ensuring our compliance with all applicable anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA, the Bribery Act or other legal requirements, including Trade Control laws. If we are not in compliance with the FCPA, Bribery Act and other anti-corruption laws or Trade Control laws, we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement and other sanctions and remedial measures, and legal expenses, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. The SEC also may suspend or bar issuers from trading securities on U.S. exchanges for violations of the FCPA\u2019s accounting provisions. Any investigation of any potential violations of the FCPA, the Bribery Act, other anti-corruption laws or Trade Control laws by U.S., U.K. or other authorities could also have an adverse impact on our reputation, our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may fail to comply with evolving European Union and other privacy laws, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to the General Data Protection Regulation, (EU) 2016/679, (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which became effective on May 25, 2018. GDPR deals with the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data. The GDPR imposes a broad range of strict requirements on companies subject to the GDPR, including requirements relating to having legal bases for processing personal information relating to identifiable individuals and transferring such information outside the EEA, including to the United States, providing details to those individuals regarding the processing of their personal information, keeping personal information secure, having data processing agreements with third parties who process personal information on our behalf, responding to individuals\u2019 requests to exercise their rights in respect of their personal information, reporting security breaches involving personal data to the competent national data protection authority and affected individuals, appointing data protection officers, conducting data protection impact assessments, and record-keeping. The GDPR increases substantially the penalties to which we could be subject in the event of any non-compliance, including fines of up to 10,000,000 Euros or up to 2% of our total worldwide annual turnover for certain comparatively minor offenses, or up to 20,000,000 Euros or up to 4% of our total worldwide annual turnover for more serious offenses. Given the limited enforcement of the GDPR to date, we face uncertainty as to the exact interpretation of the new requirements on our trials and we may be unsuccessful in implementing all measures required by data protection authorities or courts in interpretation of the new law.\nIn particular, national laws of member states of the EU have implemented national laws which may partially deviate from the GDPR and impose different and more restrictive obligations from country to country, so that we do not expect to operate in\na uniform legal landscape in the EU. Also, as it relates to processing and transfer of genetic data, the GDPR specifically allows member state nations to enact laws that impose additional and more specific requirements or restrictions, and European laws have historically differed quite substantially in this field, leading to additional uncertainty.\nIn addition, we must also ensure that we maintain adequate safeguards to enable the transfer of personal data outside of the EEA, in particular to the United States, in compliance with EU data protection laws. We expect that we will continue to face uncertainty as to whether our efforts to comply with our obligations under EU privacy laws will be sufficient. If we are investigated by an EU Member State data protection authority, we may face fines and other penalties. Any such investigation or charges by EU Member State data protection authorities could have a negative effect on our existing business and on our ability to attract and retain new clients or pharmaceutical partners. We may also experience hesitancy, reluctance, or refusal by European or multi-national clients or pharmaceutical partners to continue to use our products and solutions due to the potential risk exposure as a result of the current (and, in particular, future) data protection obligations imposed on them by certain data protection authorities in interpretation of current law, including the GDPR. Such clients or pharmaceutical partners may also view any alternative approaches to compliance as being too costly, too burdensome, too legally uncertain, or otherwise objectionable and therefore decide not to do business with us. Any of the foregoing could materially harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nFor more information concerning the implications of Brexit for our activities in compliance with the EU data protection laws, please refer to the Risk Factor entitled \u201cThe United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the European Union may have a negative effect on global economic conditions, financial markets and our business\u201d.\nRisks Related to Employee Matters and Managing Our Workforce\nWe may encounter difficulties with managing the size and makeup of our workforce, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nAlthough we have already added several capabilities, we may need to add additional qualified personnel and resources as we continue to grow our TYMLOS business and expand into other therapeutic areas. In particular, we may need to grow or transition our internal sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities to market TYMLOS and any other drug that we may successfully develop. That growth or transition would impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including the need to identify, recruit, maintain and integrate additional employees, and may take time away from running other aspects of our business, including development and commercialization of our product candidates.\nIn connection with our development of RAD011, our cannabidiol oral solution asset, we have hired or entered into consulting agreements with certain individuals who will provide assistance with the management and oversight of the assets\u2019 development and commercialization. There can be no guarantee that these individuals will smoothly and successfully integrate into our workforce or workstreams or accomplish the development or commercialization activities assigned to them within the desired timelines.\nOur future financial performance and our ability to commercialize our product candidates and to compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to manage our workforce effectively. In particular, as our commercialization plans and strategies change and develop, we will recruit and train new personnel. To that end, we must be able to:\n\u2022manage our development efforts effectively\u037e\n\u2022integrate additional management, administrative and manufacturing personnel\u037e and\n\u2022maintain sufficient administrative, accounting and management information systems and controls.\nWe may not be able to accomplish these tasks or successfully manage our operations and, accordingly, may not achieve our research, development, and commercialization goals. Our failure to accomplish any of these goals could harm our financial results and prospects.\nIf we are unable to successfully maintain and further develop internal commercialization capabilities, sales of TYMLOS or other future approved products may be negatively impacted.\nWe have built a commercial team and established the organizational infrastructure we believe necessary for successful commercialization of TYMLOS in the United States. We will need to commit significant time, financial and managerial resources to maintain and further develop our marketing and sales force to ensure they have the technical expertise required to address any challenges we may face with our continued commercialization of TYMLOS or the commercialization of any other product we may launch. Factors that may inhibit our efforts to maintain and develop our commercialization capabilities include:\n\u2022an inability to retain an adequate number of effective commercial personnel;\n\u2022our ability to train new sales personnel, who may have limited experience with our company or our products, to deliver a consistent and compliant message regarding our products that will be compelling to physicians who may prescribe them;\n\u2022an inability to equip sales personnel with effective materials, including medical and sales literature to help them educate physicians and our healthcare providers regarding our products and its proper administration;\n\u2022unforeseen costs and expenses associated with maintaining and further developing an independent sales and marketing organization.\nIf we are not successful in maintaining an effective commercial infrastructure, we may have difficulty generating product revenue, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nWe may enter into or seek to enter into business combinations and acquisitions which may be difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, divert management attention or dilute stockholder value.\nWe may enter into business combinations and acquisitions as part of our broader business strategy, including the continued expansion of our product portfolio. We have limited experience in such activities, which are typically accompanied by a number of risks, including:\n\u2022the difficulty of integrating the operations and personnel;\n\u2022the potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management;\n\u2022the potential for unknown liabilities and expenses;\n\u2022the failure to achieve the expected benefits of the combination or acquisition;\n\u2022the maintenance of acceptable standards, controls, procedures and policies; and\n\u2022the impairment of relationships with employees as a result of any integration of new management and other personnel.\nIf we are not successful in completing business combinations or acquisitions that we may pursue in the future, we would be required to reevaluate our business strategy and we may have incurred substantial expenses and devoted significant management time and resources in seeking to complete these activities. In addition, we could use substantial portions of our available cash as all or a portion of the purchase price, or we could issue additional securities as consideration for these acquisitions, which could cause our stockholders to suffer significant dilution.\nWe rely on key executive officers and scientific and medical advisors, and their knowledge of our business and technical expertise would be difficult to replace.\nWe are highly dependent on our chief executive officer and our principal scientific, regulatory and medical advisors. We do not have \"key person\" life insurance policies for any of our officers. The loss of the technical knowledge and management and industry expertise of any of our key personnel could result in delays in product development, loss of customers and sales and diversion of management resources, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nIf we are unable to hire additional qualified personnel, our ability to grow our business may be harmed.\nWe will need to hire additional qualified personnel with expertise in preclinical testing, clinical research and testing, government regulation, formulation and manufacturing and sales and marketing. We compete for qualified individuals with numerous biopharmaceutical companies, universities and other research institutions. Competition for such individuals is intense, and we cannot be certain that our search for such personnel will be successful. Attracting and retaining qualified personnel will be critical to our success.\nSignificant disruptions of information technology systems or breaches of data security could adversely affect our business.\nOur business is increasingly dependent on critical, complex and interdependent information technology systems to support business processes as well as internal and external communications. Our computer systems are vulnerable to breakdown, malicious intrusion and computer viruses. Any failure to protect against breakdowns, malicious intrusions and computer viruses may result in the impairment of production and key business processes. In addition, our systems are potentially vulnerable to data security breaches, whether by employees or others, which may expose sensitive data to unauthorized persons. Such data security breaches could lead to the loss of trade secrets or other intellectual property, or could lead to the public exposure of personal information of our employees, clinical trial patients, customers, and others. Such disruptions and breaches of security could expose us to liability and have a material adverse effect on the operating results and financial condition of our business.\nRisks Relating to Our Securities\nOur stock price may be volatile, and the value of an investment in our common stock may decline.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, following announcement of results from various clinical trials discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our stock price fluctuated substantially, reaching a high of $22.31 and a low of $6.74 in\nclosing price on The NASDAQ Global Market. The trading price of our common stock may be subject to future wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022actions or delays by the FDA, EMA or other foreign regulatory authority in respect of any NDA, MAA or other application we may submit for any of our product candidates;\n\u2022results of clinical trials of our product candidates or those of our competitors;\n\u2022our operating performance and the operating performance of similar companies;\n\u2022the success of competitive products;\n\u2022the overall performance of the equity markets;\n\u2022the number of shares of our common stock publicly owned and available for trading;\n\u2022threatened or actual litigation;\n\u2022changes in laws or regulations relating to our products, including changes in the structure of healthcare payment systems;\n\u2022any major change in our board of directors or management;\n\u2022publication of research reports about us or our industry or positive or negative recommendations or withdrawal of research coverage by securities analysts;\n\u2022large volumes of sales or other transfers of our shares of common stock by existing stockholders;\n\u2022general political, economic and market conditions; and\n\u2022the other factors described in this \"Risk Factors\" section.\nIn addition, the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the companies whose shares trade in the stock market. Securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the market price of a company's securities. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in very substantial costs, divert our management's attention and resources and harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nBecause we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, will be your sole source of gain.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain all of our future earnings, if any, to finance the growth and development of our business. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\nFuture sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase common stock, including pursuant to our equity incentive plans, could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to fall.\nAdditional capital will be needed in the future to continue our planned operations. To the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution. We may sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time. If we sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in more than one transaction, investors may be materially diluted by subsequent sales. These sales may also result in material dilution to our existing stockholders, and new investors could gain rights superior to our existing stockholders.\nPursuant to our equity incentive plan, our management is authorized to grant stock options and other equity-based awards to our employees, directors and consultants and pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan, eligible employees may also participate in an employee stock purchase plan sponsored by us. All such awards will become eligible for sale in the public market in the future, subject to certain legal and contractual limitations, which will result in dilution to our existing shareholders.\nWe may be required to pay severance benefits to our employees who are terminated under certain circumstances, which could harm our financial condition or results.\nEach of our executive officers is party to an employment agreement, and each of our other employees is party to an agreement or participates in a plan, which provides severance benefits including cash payments for severance and other benefits and acceleration of vesting of stock options and other equity awards in the event of a termination under certain circumstances. The payment of these severance benefits could harm our financial condition and results. The accelerated vesting of options and equity awards could result in dilution to our existing stockholders and harm the market price of our common stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions contained in our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company. These provisions could also make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. These provisions include:\n\u2022a staggered board of directors;\n\u2022authorizing the board to issue, without stockholder approval, preferred stock with rights senior to those of our common stock;\n\u2022authorizing the board to amend our bylaws and to fill board vacancies until the next annual meeting of the stockholders;\n\u2022prohibiting stockholder action by written consent;\n\u2022limiting the liability of, and providing indemnification to, our directors and officers;\n\u2022eliminating the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings; and\n\u2022requiring advance notification of stockholder nominations and proposals.\nSection 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law prohibits, subject to some exceptions, \"business combinations\" between a Delaware corporation and an \"interested stockholder,\" which is generally defined as a stockholder who becomes a beneficial owner of 15% or more of a Delaware corporation's voting stock, for a three-year period following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder.\nThese and other provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws under Delaware law could discourage potential takeover attempts, reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock and result in the market price of our common stock being lower than it would be without these provisions.\nOur ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $1,033.8 million of federal and $710.5 million of state net operating loss carryforwards available to offset future taxable income. Under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, if a corporation undergoes an \"ownership change\" (generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period), the corporation's ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income may be limited. We have completed studies through December 31, 2015, to determine whether any ownership change has occurred since our formation and have determined that transactions have resulted in two ownership changes, as defined under Section 382. There could be additional ownership changes in the future that could further limit the amount of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards that we can utilize.\nUnder the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d), the amount of post-2017 net operating loss carryforwards that we are permitted to deduct in any taxable year is limited to 80% of our taxable income in such year, where taxable income is determined without regard to the net operating loss carryforward deduction itself. The Tax Act generally eliminates the ability to carry back any net operating loss to prior taxable years, while allowing post-2017 unused net operating loss carryforwards to be carried forward indefinitely. There is a risk that due to changes under the Tax Act, regulatory changes or other unforeseen reasons, our existing net operating loss carryforwards could expire or otherwise be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nIf securities or industry analysts cease to publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which might cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.", "PERMNO": 14707, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "RDUS"}
