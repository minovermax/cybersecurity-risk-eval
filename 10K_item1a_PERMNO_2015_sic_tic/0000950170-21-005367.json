Risk Factors\nThe following are certain risks that could affect our business and our results of operations. The risks identified below are not all encompassing but should be considered in establishing an opinion of our future operations.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR COMPANY GENERALLY\nThe ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization; it continues to spread and mutate within the United States and many other parts of the world; and, it will likely have a material adverse effect on our business operations and prospects, financial condition, liquidity, cash flow, profitability and results of operations generally.\nAs the outbreak of the novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) continues both in the U.S. and globally, there has been significant volatility in the financial markets, as well as the adoption of emergency legislation (in the U.S. and globally) to address the negative physical, psychological, and financial impacts of the pandemic. The severity, magnitude, and duration of the current COVID-19 pandemic is uncertain, rapidly changing, and hard to predict. These uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the continued disruptive effect of the pandemic on the economy, our supply chain partners, our employees and customers, customer sentiment in general, traffic within shopping centers, and our stores. As the pandemic continues with new mutations of the virus making headlines every few months, consumer fear about contracting COVID-19 and recommendations or mandates from federal, state, and local authorities to avoid large gatherings of people or to self-quarantine may increase. For example, these mandates have already affected, and may continue to affect, traffic to many Vintage Stock stores. During our 2020 fiscal year, in response to the crisis and as a result of government mandates, Vintage Stock\u2019s stores were closed on average 45 days. In addition, a COVID-19 outbreak could cause Marquis Industries or Precision to shut down one or more production plants, resulting in reduced capacity and possible delivery delays. Further, continued impacts of the pandemic could materially adversely affect our near-term and long-term revenues, earnings, liquidity, and cash flows, and may require significant actions in response, including, but not limited to, employee furloughs, reduced store hours, store closings, reductions in budgeted expenses, or discounting of pricing of our products, all in an effort to mitigate such impacts. The extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business and financial results will depend largely on future developments, including the duration of the outbreak within the U.S., the impact on capital and financial markets, and the related impact on consumer confidence and spending, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. Due to the speed with which the COVID-19 situation continues to change, the breadth of its spread and the range of governmental, and community reactions, uncertainty around its duration and ultimate impact remains; therefore, any negative impact on our business, financial condition (including without limitation our liquidity), results of operations, prospects, and cash flows cannot be reasonably estimated at this time; but, the COVID-19 pandemic could lead to extended disruption of economic activity with an impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and workforce availability likely to be material.\nOur results of operations could fluctuate due to factors outside of our control.\nOur operating results have historically fluctuated significantly, and we could continue to experience fluctuations or revert to declining operating results due to factors that may or may not be within our control. Such factors include the following:\n\uf0b7fluctuating demand for our products and services;\n\uf0b7changes in economic conditions and the amount of consumers\u2019 discretionary spending;\n\uf0b7changes in technologies favored by consumers;\n\uf0b7the effect of the Chapter 11 Case on the Company and on the interests of various constituents;\n\uf0b7customer refunds or cancellations;\n\uf0b7our ability to continue to bill our customers through existing means;\n\uf0b7market acceptance of new or enhanced versions of our services or products;\n\uf0b7new product offerings or price competition (or pricing changes) by us or our competitors;\n\uf0b7with respect to our retail segment, the opening of new stores by competitors in our markets;\n\uf0b7with respect to our manufacturing segment, changes in import tariffs;\n\uf0b7the amount and timing of expenditures for the acquisition of new businesses and the expansion of our operations, including the hiring of new hiring of new employees, capital expenditures, and related costs (including wage cost increases due to historically low unemployment);\n\uf0b7recent steep increases at the consumer-level (CPI), including rising prices for gasoline, may dampen consumer spending at our retail establishments;\n\uf0b7technical difficulties or failures affecting our systems in general;\n\uf0b7the fixed nature of a significant amount of our operating expenses; and\nOur obligations under our consolidated indebtedness are significant.\nAs of September 30, 2021, we had approximately $58.2 million of total consolidated indebtedness outstanding consisting of (in 000's):\nThese financial obligations may have significant negative consequences for us, including:\n\uf0b7limiting our ability to satisfy our obligations;\n\uf0b7increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\uf0b7limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our businesses and the markets in which we operate;\n\uf0b7placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less debt;\n\uf0b7increasing our vulnerability to, and limiting our ability to react to, changing market conditions, changes in our industry and economic downturns;\n\uf0b7limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund working capital requirements, capital expenditures, debt service, acquisitions, general corporate or other obligations;\n\uf0b7subjecting us to a number of restrictive covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to pay dividends and distributions, make acquisitions and dispositions, borrow additional funds and make capital expenditures and other investments;\n\uf0b7restricting our and our wholly-owned subsidiaries ability to make dividend payments and other payments;\n\uf0b7limiting our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we must dedicate a significant portion of these funds to make principal and/or interest payments on our outstanding debt;\n\uf0b7exposing us to interest rate risk due to the variable interest rate on borrowings under certain of our credit facilities;\n\uf0b7causing our failure to comply with the financial and restrictive covenants contained in our current or future indebtedness, which could cause a default under such indebtedness and which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on us.\nIf we do not effectively manage our growth and business, our management, administrative, operational, and financial infrastructure and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nWe have expanded our Company over the past few years through the acquisition of different businesses in different industries. We intend to acquire additional businesses (possibly in different sectors) in the future. Significant expansion of our present operations will be required to capitalize on potential growth in market opportunities, will require us to add additional management personnel, and will require us to continue to upgrade our financial and management systems and controls and information technology infrastructure. Any further expansion will also place a significant strain on our existing management, operational, and financial resources. In order to manage our growth, we will need to continue to implement and improve our operational, marketing, and financial systems; to expand existing operations; to attract and retain superior management and personnel; and to train, manage, and expand our employee base. There is no assurance that we will be able to expand our operations effectively, as our systems, procedures and controls may be inadequate to support our expanded operations, and our management may fail to implement our business plan successfully.\nWe may not be able to secure additional capital to expand our existing operations.\nAlthough we currently have no material long-term need for capital expenditures at our existing operating subsidiaries, we will likely be required to make increased capital expenditures to fund our anticipated growth of operations, infrastructure, and personnel. In the future, we may need to seek additional capital through the issuance of debt (including convertible debt) or equity, depending upon the results of our operations, market conditions, or unforeseen needs or opportunities. Our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors, including:\n\uf0b7the pace of expansion of our operations;\n\uf0b7our response to competitive pressures; and\n\uf0b7future acquisitions of complementary products, technologies or businesses.\nThe sale of equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to existing stockholders. There is no assurance that any financing arrangements will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nWe have identified and disclosed in this Form 10-K material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. If we are not able to remediate these material weaknesses and maintain an effective system of internal\ncontrols, we may not be able to or timely report our financial results accurately, which could cause our stock price to fall or result in our stock being delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market.\nWe need to devote significant resources and time to comply with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSarbanes-Oxley\u201d) with respect to internal control over financial reporting. In addition, Section 404 under Sarbanes-Oxley requires that we assess the design and operating effectiveness of our controls over financial reporting that are necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial reports.\nAs reported in Part II - Item 9A, Controls and Procedures, there were material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting at September 30, 2021. Specifically, management\u2019s assessment concluded that the Company has the following material weaknesses: (a) lack of sufficient controls around the financial reporting process; (b) lack of proper segregation of duties within the financial reporting process; and (c) lack of evaluation of internal controls.\nWe expect our systems and controls to become increasingly complex to the extent that we integrate acquisitions and as our business grows. To manage our Company effectively today and with this anticipated complexity, we need to remediate these material weaknesses and continue to improve our operational, financial, and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures. Any failure to remediate these material weaknesses and implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in the implementation or operation of these controls, could harm our operating results, cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations, or make it more difficult to raise capital (or, if we are able to raise such capital, increase the cost of such capital), any one or more of which could adversely affect our business and/or jeopardize our listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market, which would harm our stock price.\nOur failure to comply with various applicable federal and state employment and labor laws and regulations could have a material, adverse impact on our business.\nVarious federal and state employment and labor laws and regulations govern our relationships with our employees. These laws and regulations relate to matters, such as employment discrimination, wage and hour laws, requirements to provide meal and rest periods or other benefits, family leave mandates, requirements regarding working conditions and accommodations to certain employees, citizenship or work authorization and related requirements, insurance and workers\u2019 compensation rules, healthcare laws and regulations (including with respect to the COVID-19 pandemic), and anti-discrimination and anti-harassment laws. Complying with these laws and regulations subjects us to substantial expense and non-compliance could expose us to significant liabilities. We could suffer losses from these and similar cases, and the amount of such losses or costs could be significant. In addition, several states and localities in which we operate (as well as the federal government) have from time-to-time enacted minimum wage increases, changes to eligibility for overtime pay, changes to paid sick leave, changes to mandatory vacation accruals, and changes to other similar requirements. These changes have increased our labor costs and may have a further negative impact on our labor costs in the future.\nA significant number of our employees are paid at rates related to the applicable minimum wage. Federal, state and local proposals that increase minimum wage requirements or mandate other employee matters will likely, to the extent implemented, materially increase our labor and other costs. Several states in which we operate have approved minimum wage increases that are above the federal minimum. As more jurisdictions implement minimum wage increases, our labor costs will continue to increase. Our ability to respond to minimum wage increases by increases in our prices depends on the willingness of our customers to pay higher prices and our perceived value relative to our competitors. Our distributors and suppliers could also be affected by higher minimum wages, benefit standards, and compliance costs, which would result in higher costs for goods and services that they supply to us.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights adequately.\nOur success depends both on our internally developed technology and licensed third-party technology. We rely on a variety of trademarks, service marks, and designs to promote our brand names and identity. We also rely on a combination of contractual provisions, confidentiality procedures, and trademark, copyright, trade secrecy, unfair competition, and other intellectual property laws to protect the proprietary aspects of our products and services. The commercially reasonable steps we take to protect our intellectual property rights may not be adequate to protect our intellectual property and may not prevent our competitors from gaining access to our intellectual property and proprietary information. In addition, we cannot provide assurance that courts will always uphold our intellectual property rights or enforce the contractual arrangements that we have entered into to obtain and protect our proprietary technology.\nThird parties, including our partners, contractors, or employees may infringe or misappropriate our copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade dress, and other proprietary rights. Any such infringement or misappropriation could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and prospects, financial condition, liquidity, cash flow, profitability, and results of operations generally. We may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights, which may result in the dilution of the brand identity of our services and the pricing of our services.\nWe may decide to initiate litigation in order to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of our proprietary rights. Any such litigation could result in substantial expense and may not adequately protect our intellectual property rights. In addition, we may be exposed to future litigation by third parties based on claims that our products or services infringe or misappropriate their intellectual property rights. Any such claim or litigation against us, whether or not successful, could result in substantial costs and harm our reputation. In addition, such claims or litigation could force us to do one or more of the following:\n\uf0b7cease selling or using any of our products and services that incorporate the subject intellectual property, which would adversely affect our revenue;\n\uf0b7attempt to obtain a license from the holder of the intellectual property right alleged to have been infringed or misappropriated, which license may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all; and\n\uf0b7attempt to redesign or, in the case of trademark claims, rename our products or services to avoid infringing or misappropriating the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may be costly and time-consuming.\nEven if we were to prevail, such claims or litigation could be time-consuming and expensive to prosecute or defend and could result in the diversion of our management\u2019s time and attention. These expenses and diversion of managerial resources could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and prospects, financial condition, cash flow, profitability, and results of operations generally.\nWe may be subject to intellectual property claims that create uncertainty about ownership or use of technology essential to our business and divert our managerial and other resources.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to operate without infringing the intellectual property rights of others. Third parties may, in the future, claim our current or future services, products, trademarks, technologies, business methods or processes infringe their intellectual property rights, or challenge the validity of our intellectual property rights. We may be subject to patent infringement claims or other intellectual property infringement claims that would be costly to defend and could limit our ability to use certain critical technologies or business methods. We may also become subject to interference proceedings conducted in the patent and trademark offices of various countries to determine the priority of inventions.\nThe defense and prosecution, if necessary, of intellectual property suits, interference proceedings, and related legal and administrative proceedings can become very costly and may divert our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. We may not prevail in any of these suits or proceedings. An adverse determination of any litigation or defense proceedings could require us to pay substantial compensatory and exemplary damages, could restrain us from using critical technologies, business methods or processes, and could result in us losing, or not gaining, valuable intellectual property rights.\nFurthermore, due to the voluminous amount of discovery frequently conducted in connection with intellectual property litigation, some of our confidential information could be disclosed to competitors during this type of litigation. In addition, public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments in the litigation could be perceived negatively by investors, and thus have an adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nData breaches involving customer or employee data stored by us could adversely affect our reputation and revenues.\nWe store confidential information with respect to our customers and employees. A compromise of our data security systems or those of businesses with which we interact could result in information related to our customers or employees being obtained by unauthorized persons. Any such breach of our systems could lead to fraudulent activity resulting in claims and lawsuits against us or other operational problems or interruptions in connection with such breaches. Any breach or unauthorized access in the future could result in significant legal and financial exposure and damage to our reputation that could potentially have an adverse effect on our business. While we also seek to obtain assurances that others with whom we interact will protect confidential information, there is a risk the confidentiality of data held or accessed by others may be compromised. If a compromise of our data security or function of our computer systems or website were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition, cash flows and liquidity and possibly, subject us to additional legal, regulatory and operating costs and damage our reputation in the marketplace.\nAlso, the interpretation and enforcement of data protection laws in the United States are uncertain and, in certain circumstances, contradictory. These laws may be interpreted and enforced in a manner that is inconsistent with our policies and practices. If we are subject to data security breaches or government-imposed fines, we may have a loss in sales or be forced to pay damages or other amounts, which could adversely affect profitability, or be subject to substantial costs related to compliance.\nTax matters, including the changes in corporate tax rates, disagreements with taxing authorities and imposition of new taxes could impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to income and other taxes in the U.S. and our operations, plans and results are affected by tax and other initiatives.\nWe are also subject to regular reviews, examinations, and audits by the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities with respect to our tax filings. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, if a taxing authority disagrees with the positions we have taken, we could face additional tax liability, including interest and penalties. There can be no assurance that payment of such additional amounts upon final adjudication of any disputes will not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.\nWe also need to comply with new, evolving or revised tax laws and regulations. The enactment of or increases in tariffs, or other changes in the application or interpretation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or on specific products that we sell or with which our products compete, may have an adverse effect on our business or on our results of operations.\nWe are involved in an ongoing SEC investigation, which could divert management\u2019s focus, result in substantial investigation expenses and have an adverse impact on our reputation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOn February 21, 2018, the Company received a subpoena from the SEC and a letter from the SEC that provided that the SEC was conducting an investigation. The subpoena requested documents and information concerning, among other things, the restatement of the Company\u2019s financial statements for the quarterly periods ended December 31, 2016, March 31, 2017, and June 30, 2017; the acquisition of Marquis Industries, Inc., Vintage Stock, Inc., and ApplianceSmart, Inc.; as well as the change in auditors in 2021. On August 12, 2020, three of the Company\u2019s corporate executive officers (together, the \u201cExecutives\u201d) each received a \u201cWells Notice\u201d from the Staff of the SEC relating to the Company\u2019s SEC investigation. On October 7, 2020, the Company received a \u201cWells Notice\u201d from the Staff of the SEC relating to the Company\u2019s previously-disclosed SEC investigation. The Wells Notices relate to, among other things, the Company\u2019s reporting of its financial performance for its fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, certain disclosures related to executive compensation, and its previous acquisition of ApplianceSmart. A Wells Notice is neither a formal charge of wrongdoing nor a final determination that the recipient has violated any law. The Wells Notices informed the Company and the Executives that the SEC Staff has made a preliminary determination to recommend that the SEC file an enforcement action against the Company and each of the Executives that would allege certain violations of the federal securities laws. The Company intends to vigorously defend against any and all allegations brought forth.\nOn October 1, 2018, the Company received a letter from the SEC requesting information regarding a potential violation of Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, based upon the timing of the Company\u2019s Form 8-K filed on February 14, 2018. The Company provided a response to the SEC on October 26, 2018. The Company is cooperating with the SEC in its inquiry.\nOn August 2, 2021, the SEC filed a civil complaint (the \u201cSEC Complaint\u201d) in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada naming the Company and two of its executive officers as defendants (collectively, the \"Defendants\").\nThe SEC Complaint alleges various financial, disclosure, and reporting violations related to income and earnings per share, purported undisclosed stock promotion and trading, and undisclosed executive compensation from 2016 through 2018. The violations are brought under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5; Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(B) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-14, 13a-13, Rule 13b2-1, 13b2-2; Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-3; and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933. The SEC seeks permanent injunctions against the Defendants, officer-and-director bars, disgorgement of profits, and civil penalties. The foregoing is only a general summary of the SEC Complaint, which may be accessed on the SEC\u2019s website at https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2021/lr25155.htm.\nThe Company continues to assert that the SEC\u2019s pursuit of this matter will not result in any benefit to investors and instead will only serve as a distraction from our core business. On October 1, 2021, the Company, filed a motion with the court to dismiss the complaint. The SEC filed its response opposing the motions on November 1, 2021. The defendants filed their reply responses to the SEC\u2019s opposition on November 15, 2021. The motions to dismiss are now under submission and the court has not yet scheduled a hearing date. Pursuant to the automatic stay of proceedings under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, all discovery has been stayed pending the motions to dismiss.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY\nWe may not be able to identify, acquire or establish control of, or effectively integrate previously acquired businesses, which could materially adversely affect our growth.\nAs part of our business strategy, we intend to pursue a wide array of potential strategic transactions, including acquisitions of new businesses, as well as strategic investments and joint ventures. Although we regularly evaluate such opportunities, we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or investment opportunities successfully, obtain sufficient financing on acceptable terms or at all to fund such strategic transactions, complete any such acquisitions and integrate the acquired businesses with our existing businesses, or manage profitable acquired businesses or strategic investments.\nThe acquisition of a company or business is accompanied by a number of risks, including:\n\uf0b7failure of due diligence during the acquisition process;\n\uf0b7adverse short-term effects on reported operating results;\n\uf0b7the potential loss of key partners or key personnel in connection with, or as the result of, a transaction;\n\uf0b7the impairment of relationships with clients of the acquired business, or our own customers, partners or employees, as a result of any integration of operations or the expansion of our offerings;\n\uf0b7the recording of goodwill and intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic impairment charges;\n\uf0b7the diversion of management\u2019s time and resources;\n\uf0b7the risk of entering into markets or producing products where we have limited or no experience, including the integration or removal of the acquired or disposed products with or from our existing products; and\n\uf0b7the inability properly to implement or remediate internal controls, procedures and policies appropriate for a public company at businesses that prior to our acquisition were not subject to federal securities laws and may have lacked appropriate controls, procedures and policies.\nThe acquisition of new businesses is costly and such acquisitions may not enhance our financial condition.\nOur growth strategy is to acquire companies and identify and acquire assets and technologies from companies in various industries that have a demonstrated history of strong earnings potential. The process to undertake a potential acquisition is time-consuming and costly. We expend significant resources to undertake business, financial, and legal due diligence on our potential acquisition target and there is no guarantee that we would acquire a target company after we complete due diligence.\nOur acquisitions could result in the use of substantial amounts of cash, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or convertible debt securities, significant write-downs of goodwill[dv1] [LV2] , and other intangible assets and exposure to undisclosed or potential liabilities of the acquired companies. To the extent that the goodwill arising from the acquisitions carried on the financial statements does not pass the annual goodwill impairment test, excess goodwill will be charged to, and reduce, future earnings.\nBecause we do not intend to use our own employees or members of management to run the daily operations at our acquired companies, business operations might be interrupted if employees at the acquired businesses were to resign, or be terminated.\nAs part of our acquisition strategy, we do not use our own employees or members of our management team to operate the acquired companies. Key members of management at these acquired companies have been in place for several years and have established relationships with their customers. Competition for executive-level personnel is strong and we can make no assurance that we will be able to retain these key members of management for any period of time. Although we have entered into employment agreements with certain of these key members of management and provided incentives to stay with the business after it has been acquired, if such key persons were to resign, we might face impairment of relationships with remaining employees or customers, which might cause long-term customers to terminate their relationships with the acquired companies, which may, in turn, materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR RETAIL SEGMENT\nVintage Stock\nEconomic conditions in the U.S. could adversely affect demand for the products we sell.\nSales of products by Vintage Stock are driven, in part, by discretionary spending by consumers. Consumers are typically more likely to make discretionary purchases, including purchasing movies, games, music, and other discretionary products when there are favorable economic conditions. Consumer spending may be affected by many\neconomic factors outside of our control, such as a decline in consumer confidence in current and future economic conditions, levels of employment, , consumer debt levels, and inflation. These and other economic factors could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe video game industry is cyclical and affected by the introduction of next-generation consoles, two of which were released in Fall 2020. The introduction of these new consoles could negatively impact the demand for existing products or Vintage Stock\u2019s pre-owned business model.\nThe video game industry is cyclical in nature because of the introduction and maturation of new technology: Two new consoles were introduced in November 2020; following the introduction of the new video game consoles, sales of these consoles and related software and accessories generally increase due to initial demand, while sales of older platforms and related products generally decrease as customers migrate to the new platforms. There is a shortage of new consoles and there is no guaranty that Vintage Stock will receive any of these new consoles to sell to its customers, or, if it does receive any of these new consoles to sell, that Vintage Stock will receive enough inventory to meet customer demand. If the new video game consoles are not successful, or the developers of video games do not make games to play on these new consoles, or there are no games that the public finds interesting to play, Vintage Stock\u2019s sales of new video game products could decline. In addition, some of the new consoles are \u201cbackwards compatible,\u201d meaning that games on the prior generation consoles may also be played on these new consoles. As a result, our customers may not be incentivized to sell to us or trade in their older games, resulting in less used product that we would like to obtain, which reduction could negatively impact Vintage Stock\u2019s pre-owned business and, in turn, could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flow, and liquidity.\nTechnological advances in the delivery and types of video, video games and PC entertainment software, as well as changes in consumer behavior related to these new technologies, could lower Vintage Stock\u2019s sales\nWhile it is currently possible to download video, video game content, and music to the current generation of video and gaming systems, downloading is somewhat constrained by bandwidth capacity and video game and movie file sizes. However, broadband speeds are increasing and downloading technology is becoming more prevalent and continues to evolve rapidly. The current game consoles from Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo have facilitated download technology. If these consoles and other advances in technology continue to expand our customers\u2019 ability to access and download the current format of video, music and games and incremental content from their games and videos through these and other sources, our customers may no longer choose to purchase videos, DVDs, video games and music in our stores or they may reduce their purchases in favor of other forms of video, digital, and game delivery. As a result, our sales and earnings could decline.\nVintage Stock may not compete effectively as browser, mobile and social video viewing and gaming becomes more popular.\nListening to music, gaming, and viewing video and digital content continues to evolve rapidly. The popularity of browser, mobile and social viewing and gaming have increased greatly, and this popularity is expected to continue to grow. Browser, mobile and social video viewing, listening to music and gaming are accessed through hardware other than the game consoles and traditional hand-held video and game devices we currently sell. If there is continued growth in popularity of browser, mobile and social viewing and gaming, our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity could be impacted negatively.\nSales of video games containing graphic violence may decrease as a result of actual violent events or other reasons, and Vintage Stock\u2019s, and our, financial results may be adversely affected as a result.\nMany popular video games contain material with graphic violence. These games receive an \u201cM\u201d or \u201cT\u201d rating from the Entertainment Software Ratings Board. As actual violent events occur and are publicized, or for other reasons, public acceptance of graphic violence in video games may decline. Consumer advocacy groups may increase their efforts to oppose sales of graphically-violent video games and may seek legislation prohibiting their sales. As a result, our sales of those games may decrease, which could negatively impact our results of operations.\nApplianceSmart\nApplianceSmart is subject to risks and uncertainties with respect to the actions and decisions of its creditors and other third parties who have interests in the Chapter 11 Case that may be inconsistent with ApplianceSmart\u2019s plans.\nApplianceSmart is subject to risks and uncertainties associated with its voluntary proceedings under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code filed with the Bankruptcy Court on December 9, 2019 (the \u201cCommencement Date\u201d). For the duration of the bankruptcy proceedings, ApplianceSmart\u2019s operations and our ability to execute the ApplianceSmart business strategy will be subject to risks and uncertainties associated with bankruptcy. These risks include:\n\uf0b7ApplianceSmart\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern;\n\uf0b7ApplianceSmart\u2019s ability to obtain Bankruptcy Court approval with respect to motions filed in the Chapter 11 Case from time to time;\n\uf0b7ApplianceSmart\u2019s ability to develop, execute, confirm and consummate a plan of reorganization with respect to the Chapter 11 Case, views and objections of creditors and other parties in interest that may make it difficult to develop and consummate a plan in a timely manner;\n\uf0b7ApplianceSmart\u2019s ability to obtain and maintain normal payment and other terms with credit card companies, customers, vendors, and service providers;\n\uf0b7ApplianceSmart\u2019s ability to maintain contracts that are critical to its operations;\n\uf0b7ApplianceSmart\u2019s ability to attract, motivate and retain management and other key employees;\n\uf0b7ApplianceSmart\u2019s ability to retain key vendors or secure alternative supply sources;\n\uf0b7ApplianceSmart\u2019s ability to fund and execute its business plan; and\n\uf0b7ApplianceSmart\u2019s ability to obtain acceptable and appropriate financing.\nThese risks and uncertainties could significantly affect its business and operations in various ways. For example, negative publicity or events associated with the Chapter 11 Case could adversely affect ApplianceSmart\u2019s relationships with its vendors and employees, as well as with customers, which in turn could adversely affect its operations and financial condition. Also, pursuant to the Bankruptcy Code, ApplianceSmart requires Bankruptcy Court approval for transactions outside the ordinary course of business, which may limit its ability to respond to certain events in a timely manner or take advantage of certain opportunities. Because of the risks and uncertainties associated with the Chapter 11 Case, we cannot predict or quantify the ultimate impact that events occurring during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Case will have on ApplianceSmart\u2019s or the Company\u2019s consolidated business, financial condition, results of operations, or the certainty as to ApplianceSmart\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. As a result of the Chapter 11 Case, realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities are subject to uncertainty. While operating under the protection of the Bankruptcy Code, and subject to Bankruptcy Court approval or otherwise as permitted in the normal course of business, ApplianceSmart may sell or otherwise dispose of a portion or all of its assets and liquidate or settle liabilities for amounts other than those reflected in our consolidated financial statements. Further, a plan of reorganization could materially change the amounts and classifications reported in its consolidated historical financial statements, which do not give effect to any adjustments to the carrying value of assets or amounts of liabilities that might be necessary as a consequence of confirmation of a plan of reorganization.\nApplianceSmart\u2019s businesses could suffer from a long and protracted restructuring.\nApplianceSmart\u2019s future results are dependent upon the successful confirmation and implementation of a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization. Failure to obtain this approval in a timely manner could adversely affect ApplianceSmart\u2019s operating results and cash flows, as its ability to obtain financing to fund its operations may be adversely affected by protracted bankruptcy proceedings. If a protracted reorganization or liquidation were to occur, there is a significant risk that ApplianceSmart\u2019s enterprise value would be substantially eroded to the detriment of all stakeholders.\nFurthermore, we cannot predict the ultimate amount of all settlement terms for the liabilities of ApplianceSmart that will be subject to the plan of reorganization. Even if a plan of reorganization were approved and implemented, its\noperating results and cash flows may be adversely affected by the possible reluctance of prospective lenders to do business with a company that may have recently emerged from bankruptcy.\nOperating as a Debtor in Possession under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code may restrict ApplianceSmart\u2019s ability to pursue its business strategies.\nUnder Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, transactions outside the ordinary course of business will be subject to the prior approval of the Bankruptcy Court, which may limit ApplianceSmart\u2019s ability to respond to certain events in a timely manner or take advantage of certain opportunities. ApplianceSmart must obtain Bankruptcy Court approval to, among other things:\n\uf0b7engage in certain transactions with its various stakeholders;\n\uf0b7buy or sell assets outside the ordinary course of business; and\n\uf0b7borrow funds for its operations, investments or other capital needs or to engage in other business activities that would be in its or our best interest.\nSufficient debtor-in-possession financing may not be available and ApplianceSmart\u2019s emergence from the Chapter 11 Case is not assured.\nIf cash flows and borrowings under any debtor-in-possession financing are not sufficient to meet ApplianceSmart\u2019s liquidity requirements, it is uncertain whether it would be able to reorganize its business. The amount that will be available for distributions to its creditors and other holders of claims against and interests in ApplianceSmart and its business, including holders of secured claims, in connection with its reorganization and consummation of a plan of reorganization is uncertain. ApplianceSmart will likely incur significant costs in connection with developing and seeking approval of a plan of reorganization, and financing, which may not be supported by certain of its stakeholders. If ApplianceSmart were unable to develop a feasible plan of reorganization, or were unable to gain access to financing to operate its business during the Chapter 11 Case, it is possible that ApplianceSmart would have to liquidate a portion or all of its assets, in which case it is likely that holders of claims would receive substantially less favorable distributions than they would receive if ApplianceSmart were to emerge as a viable, reorganized business.\nOur senior management team and other key personnel may not be able to execute the ApplianceSmart business plan as currently developed, given the substantial attention required of such individuals by the Chapter 11 Case.\nThe execution of the ApplianceSmart business plan also depends on the efforts of its senior management team and other key personnel to execute the ApplianceSmart business plan. Such individuals may be required to devote significant efforts to the prosecution of the Chapter 11 Case, thereby potentially impairing their abilities to execute the ApplianceSmart business plan and the business plan of the Company generally. Accordingly, ApplianceSmart\u2019s business plan may not be implemented as anticipated, which may cause its financial results to deviate materially from the current projections.\nApplianceSmart may be subject to claims that will not be discharged in the Chapter 11 Case, which could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and profitability.\nThe Bankruptcy Code generally provides that the confirmation of a plan of reorganization discharges a debtor from substantially all debts arising prior to confirmation and specified debts arising afterwards. With few exceptions, all claims that arose prior to the Commencement Date and before confirmation of the plan of reorganization (i) would be subject to compromise and/or treatment under the plan of reorganization or (ii) would be discharged in accordance with the Bankruptcy Code and the terms of the plan of reorganization. Any material claims not ultimately discharged by the Bankruptcy Court could have an adverse effect on ApplianceSmart\u2019s results of operations and profitability.\nIn certain limited instances, a Chapter 11 case may be converted to a case under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.\nUpon a showing of cause, the Bankruptcy Court may convert ApplianceSmart\u2019s Chapter 11 Case to a case under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. In such event, a Chapter 7 trustee would be appointed or elected to liquidate\nApplianceSmart\u2019s assets for distribution in accordance with the priorities established by the Bankruptcy Code. We believe that liquidation under Chapter 7 would result in significantly smaller distributions being made to ApplianceSmart\u2019s creditors than those provided for under a Chapter 11 proceeding because of (i) the likelihood that the assets would have to be sold or otherwise disposed of in a distressed fashion over a short period of time, rather than in a controlled manner and as a going concern, (ii) additional administrative expenses involved in the appointment of a Chapter 7 trustee, and (iii) additional expenses and claims, some of which would be entitled to priority, that would be generated during the liquidation and from the rejection of leases and other executory contracts in connection with a cessation of operations.\nApplianceSmart\u2019s, and our consolidated, financial results may be volatile and may not reflect historical trends.\nWhile in Chapter 11, we expect that ApplianceSmart\u2019s, and our consolidated, financial results may be volatile, as asset impairments and dispositions, restructuring activities, contract terminations and rejections, and claims assessments may significantly impact our consolidated financial statements. As a result, ApplianceSmart\u2019s historical financial performance may not be indicative of its financial performance after the Commencement Date. In addition, if ApplianceSmart emerges from Chapter 11, the amounts reported in subsequent consolidated financial statements may materially change relative to historical consolidated financial statements as a result of revisions to ApplianceSmart\u2019s operating plans pursuant to a plan of reorganization. Moreover, if ApplianceSmart emerges from Chapter 11, we may be required to adopt fresh-start accounting. If fresh-start accounting is applicable, our assets and liabilities will be recorded at fair value as of the fresh-start reporting date. The fair value of our assets and liabilities may differ materially from the recorded values of assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. If fresh-start accounting is required, our financial results after the application of fresh-start accounting may be materially different from historical trends.\nApplianceSmart may not have sufficient cash to maintain its operations during the Chapter 11 Case or fund its emergence from the bankruptcy.\nBecause of ApplianceSmart\u2019s financial condition, it will have heightened exposure to, and less ability to withstand, the operating risks that are customary in its industry, such as fluctuations in raw material prices and, indirectly, currency exchange rates. Any of these factors could result in the need for substantial additional funding. A number of other factors, including the Chapter 11 Case, ApplianceSmart\u2019s financial results in recent years, and the competitive environment it faces, adversely affect the availability and terms of funding that might be available to ApplianceSmart during, and upon emergence from, Chapter 11. As such, ApplianceSmart may not be able to source capital at rates and terms acceptable to it, or at all, to fund its current operations or our exit from bankruptcy. The inability to obtain necessary additional funding on acceptable terms would have a material adverse impact on ApplianceSmart and on its ability to sustain its operations, both currently and upon emergence from bankruptcy.\nA disruption in ApplianceSmart\u2019s relationships with, or in the operations of, any of ApplianceSmart\u2019s key suppliers could cause ApplianceSmart\u2019s, and our, net sales and profitability to decline.\nThe success of ApplianceSmart\u2019s business and growth strategy depends to a significant degree on the availability of open box and \u201cb-line\u201d product from its suppliers. ApplianceSmart does not have long-term supply agreements or exclusive arrangements with any of its suppliers. ApplianceSmart typically orders its inventory through the issuance of individual purchase orders to vendors, allowing ApplianceSmart to remain selective of the quality and type of product it purchases. ApplianceSmart has no contractual assurance of the continued supply of merchandise in the amount and assortment currently offered to its customers and may be subjected to rationing by suppliers. In addition, ApplianceSmart relies heavily on a relatively small number of suppliers.\nApplianceSmart\u2019s suppliers also provide it with specific types of marketing allowances and volume rebates. Failure by ApplianceSmart to continue to meet the threshold for volume rebates of discontinuance or modification by its suppliers of these incentives could have a materially adverse effect on the breadth at which the Company can achieve brand awareness that translates to net sales.\nThe financial condition of ApplianceSmart\u2019s suppliers may also adversely affect their access to capital liquidity with which to maintain their inventory, production levels, and product quality and to operate their businesses, all of which\ncould adversely affect its supply chain. Negative impacts on the financial condition of any of ApplianceSmart\u2019s suppliers may cause suppliers to reduce their offerings of customer incentives and vendor allowances, cooperative marketing expenditures and product promotions. It may also cause them to change their pricing policies, which could impact the demand for their products.\nRisk Factors Specific to Both ApplianceSmart and Vintage Stock\nAs a seller of certain consumer products, Vintage Stock and ApplianceSmart are subject to various federal, state, and local laws, regulations, and statutes related to product safety and consumer protection.\nWhile Vintage Stock and ApplianceSmart take steps to comply with these laws, there can be no assurance that they will be in compliance, and failure to comply with these laws could result in penalties that could have a negative impact on their respective businesses, financial condition, and results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. Each of them may also be subject to involuntary or voluntary product recalls or product liability lawsuits. Direct costs or reputational damage associated with product recalls or product liability lawsuits, individually or in the aggregate, could have a negative impact on future revenues and results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nInternational events could delay or prevent the delivery of products to our suppliers.\nSome of Vintage Stock\u2019s and ApplianceSmart\u2019s suppliers rely on foreign sources to manufacture a portion of the products or raw materials that we purchase from them. As a result, any event causing a disruption of imports, including natural disasters or the imposition of import restrictions or trade restrictions in the form of tariffs or quotas, could increase the cost and reduce the supply of products available to Vintage Stock and ApplianceSmart, which could lower their sales and profitability and, indirectly, ours.\nIf we are unable to renew or enter into new leases on favorable terms, our revenue growth may decline.\nAll of Vintage Stock\u2019s and ApplianceSmart\u2019s retail stores are located in leased premises. If the cost of leasing existing stores increases, neither entity can be certain that either will be able to maintain their respective existing store locations as leases expire. In addition, neither entity may be able to enter into new leases on favorable terms or at all, or may not be able to locate suitable alternative sites or additional sites for new store expansion in a timely manner. Their revenues and earnings may decline if they fail to maintain existing store locations, enter into new leases, locate alternative sites, or find additional sites for new store expansion.\nAn adverse trend in sales during the winter and holiday selling season could impact our financial results.\nOur retail business, like that of many retailers, is seasonal, with a major portion of Vintage Stock\u2019s and ApplianceSmart\u2019s sales realized around various holidays and other days, including Black Friday, President\u2019s Day, tax refund season, Memorial Day, July 4th, and Labor Day. Any adverse trend in sales during these times could negatively impact their results of operations and, indirectly, ours.\nResults of operations may fluctuate from quarter to quarter.\nVintage Stock\u2019s and ApplianceSmart\u2019s results of operations may fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending upon several factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to:\n\uf0b7the timing and allocations of new product releases;\n\uf0b7the timing of new store openings or closings;\n\uf0b7shifts in the timing or content or certain promotions or service offerings;\n\uf0b7the effect of changes in tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we are operating;\n\uf0b7acquisition costs and the integration of companies we acquire or invest in; and\n\uf0b7the costs associated with the exit of unprofitable markets or stores.\nThese and other factors could affect their respective businesses, financial condition and results of operations, cash flows and liquidity, and this makes the prediction of our financial results on a quarterly basis difficult. Also, it is possible that our quarterly financial results may be below the expectations of public market analysts.\nFailure to manage our new store openings effectively could lower our sales and profitability.\nOur growth strategy depends in part upon Vintage Stock and ApplianceSmart opening new stores and operating them profitably. Their ability to open new stores and operate them profitability depends upon a number of factors, some of which may be beyond our control. These factors include the ability to:\n\uf0b7identify new store locations, negotiate suitable leases and build out the stores in a timely and cost-efficient manner;\n\uf0b7hire and train skilled associates;\n\uf0b7integrate new stores into existing operations; and\n\uf0b7increase sales at new store locations.\nIf we fail to manage new store openings in a timely and cost-efficient manner, our growth or profits may decrease.\nIf our management information systems fail to perform or are inadequate, our ability to manage our business could be disrupted.\nWe rely on computerized inventory and management systems to coordinate and manage the activities in our stores and distribution centers. We use inventory replenishment systems to track sales and inventory. Our ability rapidly to process incoming shipments of new products and deliver them to all of our stores enables us to meet peak demand and replenish our stores to keep them in stock at optimum levels and to move inventory efficiently. If our inventory or management information systems fail to perform these functions adequately, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, if operations in any of our distribution centers were to shut down or be disrupted for a prolonged period of time or if these centers were unable to accommodate the continued store growth in a particular region, our business would suffer.\nWe may record future goodwill impairment charges or other asset impairment charges which could negatively impact our future results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have previously recorded significant goodwill as a result of our acquisition of Vintage Stock. Because we have grown in part through acquisitions, goodwill and other acquired intangible assets represent a substantial portion of our assets. We also have long-lived assets consisting of property and equipment and other identifiable intangible assets which we review both on an annual basis as well as when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If a determination is made that a significant impairment in value of goodwill, other intangible assets, or long-lived assets has occurred, such determination could require us to impair a substantial portion of our assets. Asset impairments could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause of our floating rate credit facilities, we may be adversely affected by interest rate changes.\nOur financial position may be affected by fluctuations in interest rates, as our floating rate credit facilities are subject to floating interest rates. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control. Due to our current borrowings against our floating rate credit facilities, or if we were to increase our floating rate credit borrowings, a significant increase in interest rates generally could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR FLOORING MANUFACTURING SEGMENT\nThe floor covering industry is sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, such as consumer confidence and income, corporate and government spending, interest rate levels, availability of credit and demand for housing. Significant or prolonged declines in the U.S. or global economies could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s flooring manufacturing business.\nDownturns in the U.S. and global economies, along with the residential and commercial markets in such economies, negatively impact the floor covering industry and our flooring manufacturing business. Although difficult economic conditions have improved in the U.S., there will likely be additional downturns in the future that could cause the industry to deteriorate. A significant or prolonged decline in residential or commercial remodeling or new construction activity could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nMarquis may be unable to predict customer preferences or demand accurately, or to respond to technological developments.\nMarquis operates in a market sector where demand is strongly influenced by rapidly changing customer preferences as to product design and technical features. Failure to respond quickly and effectively to changing customer demand or technological developments could materially adversely affect Marquis\u2019 business, financial condition and results of operations and, indirectly, ours.\nMarquis faces intense competition in the flooring industry that could decrease demand for its products or force it to lower its prices, which could have a material adverse effect on its business operations and prospects, financial condition, liquidity, cash flow, profitability, and results of operations generally.\nThe floor covering industry is highly competitive. Marquis faces competition from a number of manufacturers and independent distributors, many of whom have more resources than it. Maintaining its competitive position may require substantial investments in its product development efforts, manufacturing facilities, distribution network, and sales and marketing activities. Competitive pressures may also result in decreased demand for our products or force it to lower its prices. Moreover, a strong U.S. dollar, combined with lower fuel costs, may contribute to more attractive pricing for imports that compete with Marquis\u2019 products, which may put pressure on its pricing. The occurrence of one or more of these factors could materially adversely affect its business, financial condition, and results of operations and, indirectly, ours.\nIn periods of rising costs, Marquis may be unable to pass raw materials, energy and fuel-related cost increases on to its customers, which could have a material adverse effect on its business operations and prospects, financial condition, liquidity, cash flow, profitability, and results of operations.\nThe prices of raw materials and fuel-related costs vary significantly with market conditions. Although Marquis generally attempts to pass on increases in raw material, energy, and fuel-related costs to its customers, its ability to do so is dependent upon the rate and magnitude of any increase, competitive pressures, and market conditions for its products. There have been in the past, and may be in the future, periods of time during which increases in these costs cannot be recovered. During such periods of time, the occurrence of such events may materially adversely affect Marquis\u2019 business, financial condition, and results of operations and, indirectly, ours.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR STEEL MANUFACTURING SEGMENT\nThe demand for Precision Marshall\u2019s products may decrease if manufacturing in North America declines or if automakers, who manufacture their products in the U.S., do not introduce new models or their sales decline.\nThe products manufactured by Precision Marshall typically follow the North American (primarily, the U.S.) manufacturing cycle, with a large emphasis on automotive manufacturing. If North American (primarily, the U.S.) manufacturing is transferred offshore, then the need for our products to make tools and dies will decrease, which will have a negative impact on Precision Marshall\u2019s business, financial condition (including, without limitation, its liquidity), results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, we rely heavily on the sale of our products to automakers who purchase our products when they retool production lines in connection with the introduction of new models. If those automakers do not introduce a new model in any given year, Precision Marshall\u2019s our sales may decrease which\nwill have a negative impact on our business, financial condition (including, without limitation, our liquidity), results of operations, and cash flows and, indirectly, ours.\nLimited availability, or volatility in prices of raw materials and energy may constrain operating levels and reduce profit margins.\nPrecision Marshall and other steel producers have periodically faced problems obtaining sufficient raw materials in a timely manner, and sometimes at all, due to a limited number of suppliers, delays, defaults, severe weather conditions, force majeure events (including public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and general national supply chain issues), shortages, or transportation problems (such as shortages of barges, vessels, rail cars or trucks, or disruption of rail lines, waterways, or natural gas transmission lines), resulting in production curtailments. As a result, Precision Marshall may be exposed to risks concerning pricing and availability of raw materials from third parties, as well as supply and logistics constraints moving its own raw materials to its plants. In addition, if the already limited number of suppliers consolidate, it would limit Precision Marshall\u2019s negotiating power for raw material purchases.\nPrecision Marshall has in the past, and may in the future, purchase raw materials from sources even when they are at above market prices. Additionally, any future decreases in iron ore, scrap, natural gas and oil prices may place downward pressure on steel prices. If steel prices decline, Precision Marshall\u2019s profit margins could temporarily be reduced, as higher cost inventory is turned over.\nShortages of qualified and trainable labor, increased labor costs, or Precision Marshall\u2019s failure to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our financial results.\nPrecision Marshall depends on skilled or trainable drug-free labor for the manufacture of its products. Precision Marshall\u2019s continued success depends on the active participation of its key employees. Precision Marshall, like other companies that reply on a trained blue-collar workforce, receives pressure from other manufacturers regarding the labor pool. Precision Marshall, aside from competing with other manufacturers, also competes with non-industrial blue-collar professions for labor. Should a significant employer move into our geographical area, such employer could draw from the current labor pool and require a substantial increase in training expense.\nOur operational footprint, unplanned equipment outages, and other unforeseen disruptions may adversely impact our results of operations.\nPrecision Marshall has adjusted its business model over time to utilize its equipment and manufacturing facility fully. Production depends on running at a moderate rate of capacity. Outages due to power outages, weather, pandemics (including the Covid-19 pandemic), or machine outages affect Precision\u2019s capability to produce at the level necessary to meet customer demand or at all.\nIt is also possible that operations may be disrupted due to other unforeseen circumstances, such as union and other foreign tariffs, free trade agreements, trade regulations, laws, and policies. Precision Marshall is also exposed to similar risks involving major customers and suppliers, such as force majeure events of raw materials suppliers that have occurred and may occur in the future. Availability of raw materials and delivery of products to customers could be affected by logistical disruptions, such as shortages of barges, ocean vessels, rail cars or trucks, or unavailability of rail lines or of the locks on the Great Lakes or other bodies of water. To the extent that lost production could not be compensated for at unaffected facilities and depending on the length of the outage, our sales and our unit production costs could be adversely affected.\nOur production and distribution workforce is unionized, and we may face labor disruptions that would interfere with our operations.\nPrecision Marshall\u2019s manufacturing employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement through the United Steelworkers and its warehouse and distribution workforce employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement through the International Association of Aeronautical and Machinists. These agreements were successfully\nrenegotiated during 2021 without a work stoppage, and were extended through September 2026 and April 2026, respectively. Future negotiations prior to the expiration of the collective bargaining agreements may result in labor unrest for which a strike or work stoppage is possible. Strikes and/or work stoppages could negatively affect Precision Marshall\u2019s operational and financial results and may increase operating expenses and, indirectly, ours.\nWe rely on third parties for transportation services, and increases in costs or the availability of transportation may adversely affect our business and operations\nPrecision Marshall\u2019s business depends on the transportation of a large number of products. It relies primarily on third parties for transportation of its products, as well as delivery of its raw materials. Any increase in the cost of the transportation of our raw materials or products, as a result of increases in fuel or labor costs, higher demand for logistics services, consolidation in the transportation industry, or otherwise, may adversely affect Precision Marshall\u2019s results of operations, as it may not be able to pass such cost increases on to its customers.\nIf any of these transportation service providers were to fail to deliver raw materials to Precision Marshall in a timely manner, it might be unable to manufacture and deliver its products in response to customer demand. In addition, if any of these third parties were to cease operations or cease doing business with Precision Marshall, it might be unable to replace them at a reasonable cost or at any cost, as there are a limited number of suppliers worldwide for Precision Marshall\u2019s raw materials.\nIn addition, such failure of a third-party transportation provider could harm Precision Marshall\u2019s reputation, negatively affect its customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on its financial position and results of operations and, indirectly, ours.\nWe face risks relating to changes in U.S. and foreign tariffs, trade agreements, laws, and policies\nPrecision Marshall\u2019s business depends on manufacturing products in North America. If tariffs were to rise disproportionally on raw materials compared to finished tools, Precision Marshall would be at risk for manufacturers to cease purchasing the products from it and instead purchasing products from third parties who are not subject to such tariffs, trade agreements, laws, and/or policies.\nThe steel industry is highly cyclical, which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nSteel consumption is highly cyclical and generally follows economic and industrial conditions both worldwide and in regional markets. This volatility makes it difficult to balance the procurement of raw materials and energy with global steel prices, our steel production and customer product demand. Precision Marshall has implemented strategic initiatives to produce more viable results during periods of economic and market downturns; but, this may not be enough to mitigate the effect that the volatility inherent in the steel industry has on our results of operations.\nAdditionally, Precision Marshall\u2019s business is reliant on certain other industries that are cyclical in nature. Precision Marshall sells to distributors, who, in turn, sell to the automotive, appliance, defense, and construction-related industries. Some of these industries exhibit a great deal of sensitivity to general economic conditions and may also face meaningful fluctuations in demand based on a number of factors outside of Precision Marshall\u2019s control, including regulatory factors, economic conditions, and raw material and energy costs. As a result, downturns, or volatility in any of the markets served could adversely affect Precision Marshall\u2019s financial position, results of operations and cash flows and, indirectly, ours.\nWe are subject to foreign currency risks, which may negatively impact our profitability and cash flows.\nThe purchase of raw material and certain necessary equipment are transactions that often take place with foreign countries. The weakening of the of the U.S. Dollar against the Euro negatively affects the price that Precision Marshall pays for raw materials and equipment. Volatility in the markets and exchange rates for foreign currencies and contracts in foreign currencies could have a significant impact on Precision Marshall\u2019s reported financial results and condition and, indirectly, ours.\nCompliance with existing and new environmental regulations, environmental permitting and approval requirements may result in delays or other adverse impacts on planned projects, our results of operations and cash flows.\nSteel producers in the U.S., along with their customers and suppliers, are subject to numerous federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations concern the generation, storage, transportation, disposal, emission or discharge of pollutants, contaminants and hazardous substances into the environment, the reporting of such matters, and the general protection of public health and safety, natural resources, wildlife and the environment. Steel producers in the EU are subject to similar laws. These laws continue to evolve and are becoming increasingly stringent. The ultimate impact of complying with such laws and regulations is not always clearly known or determinable because regulations under some of these laws have not yet been promulgated or are undergoing revision. Additionally, compliance with certain state and local requirements could result in substantially increased capital requirements and operating costs. Compliance with current or future regulations could entail additional costs for additional systems and could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows. Failure to comply with the requirements may result in administrative, civil, and criminal penalties, revocation of permits to conduct business or construct certain facilities, substantial fines or sanctions, enforcement actions (including orders limiting our operations or requiring corrective measures), natural resource damages claims, cleanup and closure costs, and third-party claims for property damage and personal injury as a result of violations of, or liabilities under, environmental laws, regulations, codes and common law. The amount and timing of environmental expenditures is difficult to predict, and, in some cases, liability may be imposed without regard to contribution or to whether we knew of, or caused, the release of hazardous substances.\nIn addition, Precision Marshall outsources all disposal of waste material, non-compliance by third party providers could result in additional costs to defend environmental claims or additional costs to replace the outsourced entities.\nThere can be no assurance that future approvals, licenses and permits will be granted or that Precision Marshall will be able to maintain and renew the approvals, licenses, and permits it currently holds. Failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, compliance with the environmental permitting and approval requirements may be costly and time consuming and could result in delays or other adverse impacts on planned projects, our results of operations and cash flows.\nIncreasing pressure to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from steelmaking operations to comply with EU regulations as well as societal expectations could increase costs to manufacture future raw materials or reduce the amount of materials being manufactured.\nPrecision Marshall relies on raw material sources in the EU and USA. Tightening of those requirements in the EU and/or sources in the USA could deter steel produces from producing the raw material for our products or result in significant price increases of our raw material.\nGENERAL RISK FACTORS\nAn SEC investigation has resulted in the filing by the SEC of the SEC Complaint and at least one stockholder derivative class action, which could divert management's focus, or result in substantial litigation expense. Adverse developments in our ongoing proceeding or future legal proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and prospects, reputation, financial condition, results of operations, or stock price.\nOn February 21, 2018, the Company received a subpoena from the SEC and a letter from the SEC stating that it is conducting an investigation. On October 1, 2018, the Company received a letter from the SEC requesting information regarding a potential violation of Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, based upon the timing of the Company\u2019s Form 8-K filed on February 14, 2018. On August 12, 2020, three of the Company\u2019s corporate executive officers (together, the \u201cExecutives\u201d) each received a \u201cWells Notice\u201d from the Staff of the SEC relating to the Company\u2019s SEC investigation. On October 7, 2020, the Company received a \u201cWells Notice\u201d from the Staff of the SEC relating to the Company\u2019s previously-disclosed SEC investigation. On August 2, 2021, the SEC Complaint was filed and, on August 13, 2021, the Sieggreen Class Action was filed. On October 1, 2021, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the SEC Complaint. The SEC filed its response opposing the motions on November 1, 2021. The defendants filed their reply responses to the SEC\u2019s opposition on November 15, 2021. The motions to dismiss are now under\nsubmission and the court has not yet scheduled a hearing date. Pursuant to the automatic stay of proceedings under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, all discovery has been stayed pending the motions to dismiss.\nWe may be subject to additional investigations, arbitration proceedings, audits, regulatory inquiries and similar actions, including matters related to intellectual property, employment, securities laws, disclosures, tax, accounting, class action and product liability, as well as regulatory and other claims related to our business and our industry, which we refer to collectively as legal proceedings. We cannot predict the outcome of any particular proceeding, or whether ongoing investigations will be resolved favorably or ultimately result in charges or material damages, fines or other penalties, enforcement actions, bars against serving as an officer or director, or practicing before the SEC, or civil or criminal proceedings against us or members of our senior management.\nLegal proceedings in general, and securities and class action litigation and regulatory investigations in particular, can be expensive and disruptive. Our insurance, to the extent maintained, may not cover all claims that may be asserted against us and we are unable to predict how long the legal proceedings to which we are currently subject will continue. An unfavorable outcome of any legal proceeding may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations, prospects, or our stock price. Any proceeding could negatively impact our reputation among our stakeholders. Furthermore, publicity surrounding ongoing legal proceedings, even if resolved favorably for us, could result in additional legal proceedings against us, as well as damage our image.\nDue to our concentrated stock ownership, public stockholders may have no effective voice in our management and the trading price of our common stock may be adversely affected.\nAs of December 22, 2021, Isaac Capital Group LLC (\u201cICG\u201d), together with Jon Isaac, our President and CEO and the President and sole member of ICG, control approximately 46.2% of the outstanding voting power of our company (assuming the exercise of all outstanding and exercisable warrants held by them). Jon Isaac has the sole power to vote the shares of our common stock owned by ICG. As a result, Jon Isaac, both individually and through ICG, is able to exercise significant influence over all matters that require us to obtain stockholder approval, including the election of directors to our Board and approval of significant corporate transactions that we may consider, such as a merger or other sale of our Company or its assets. Moreover, such a concentration of voting power could have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring us. This significant concentration of share ownership may also adversely affect the trading price for our common stock because investors may perceive disadvantages in owning stock in companies with concentrated stock ownership.\nBecause we have no current plans to pay cash dividends on our common stock for foreseeable future, you may not receive any return on investment unless you sell your shares of common stock for a price greater than your purchase price for your shares.\nWe may retain future earnings, if any, for future operation, expansion, and debt repayment and, with the exception of dividends payable on shares of our Series E Preferred Stock, we have no current plans to pay cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. In addition, our ability to pay dividends may be limited by covenants of any existing and future outstanding indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur. Therefore, any return on your investment would likely come only from an increase in the market value of our common stock. As a result, you may not receive any return on an investment in our common stock unless you sell your common stock for a price greater than your purchase price.\nCertain provisions of Nevada law, in our organizational documents and in contracts to which we are party may prevent or delay a change of control of our company.\nWe are subject to the Nevada anti-takeover laws regulating corporate takeovers. These anti-takeover laws prevent Nevada corporations from engaging in a merger, consolidation, sales of its stock or assets, and certain other transactions with any stockholder, including all affiliates and associates of the stockholder, who owns 10% or more of the corporation\u2019s outstanding voting stock, for three years following the date that the stockholder acquired 10% or more of the corporation\u2019s voting stock, except in certain situations. In addition, our amended and restated articles of\nincorporation and bylaws include a number of provisions that may deter or impede hostile takeovers or changes of control or management. These provisions include the following:\n\uf0b7the authority of our Board of Directors to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the price, rights, preferences, and privileges of these shares, without stockholder approval;\n\uf0b7stockholders must comply with advance notice requirements to transact any business at the annual meeting;\n\uf0b7all stockholder actions must be effected at a duly called meeting of stockholders and not by written consent, unless such action or proposal is first approved by our Board of Directors;\n\uf0b7special meetings of the stockholders may be called only by the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, or the President of our Company;\n\uf0b7a director may be removed from office only for cause by the holders of at least two-thirds of the voting power entitled to vote at an election of directors;\n\uf0b7our Board of Directors is expressly authorized to alter, amend or repeal our bylaws;\n\uf0b7newly-created directorships and vacancies on our Board of Directors may only be filled by a majority of remaining directors, and not by our stockholders; and\n\uf0b7cumulative voting is not allowed in the election of our directors.\nThese provisions of Nevada law and our articles of incorporation and bylaws could prohibit or delay mergers or other takeover or change of control of our company and may discourage attempts by other companies to acquire us, even if such a transaction would be beneficial to our stockholders.", "PERMNO": 92557, "SIC": 5700, "TIC": "LIVE"}
