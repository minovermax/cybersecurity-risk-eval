Risk Factors.\nWe face a variety of risks that are inherent in our business. In addition to the factors discussed in this report and in other documents we file with the SEC that could adversely affect our businesses, results of operations and financial condition, new risks may emerge at any time, and we cannot predict those risks or estimate the extent to which they may affect our business or financial performance. Therefore, the risk factors below should not be considered a complete list of potential risks that we may face.\nAny risk factor described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in any of our other SEC

pandemic has resulted in widespread volatility and deterioration in economic conditions across the United States. Governmental authorities have taken a number of steps to combat or slow the spread of COVID-19, including shutdowns of non-essential businesses, stay-at-home orders, social distancing measures, and other actions which have disrupted economic activity. Certain states are experiencing new outbreaks of COVID-19 and have re-imposed shutdowns of restaurants, entertainment, and similar venues. These disruptions and uncertainties related to shutdowns and reopenings have continued to result in a significant reduction in the number of customers at our branch locations and lowered demand for our products, which, combined with our credit tightening, has decreased our loan originations. COVID-19 has also resulted in higher unemployment in the United States, which over time may result in increased delinquencies and credit losses on finance receivables outstanding. As a result, we cannot foresee whether the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic will be effectively contained, nor can we predict the severity and duration of its impact.\nRecently, authorities have begun to distribute newly developed COVID-19 vaccines to health care workers and other priority groups, which over time are designed to create \u201cherd immunity\u201d and diminish, if not eliminate, the crisis. The success of the vaccination program will depend to a large extent on the willingness of Americans to receive vaccinations and the effectiveness of the distribution effort, both of which are uncertain at this time. Moreover, new strains of the virus are spreading in the U.S. and abroad, and it is uncertain how effective the vaccines will be against these new strains.\nWe believe that many of our customers have benefited from the enhanced benefits provided by the CARES Act, some of which, such as enhanced unemployment benefits, were available from March 2020 through July 2020. We believe they will also benefit from the CAA. The CAA provides for another round of direct payments, enhanced unemployment benefits, education funding, and aid to sectors still reeling from the economic fallout of the pandemic. While these measures may benefit many of our customers, we cannot assure you that the implementation of these measures will offset the negative impact of COVID-19 on our customers. If the CAA or any additional stimulus measures are not sufficient to remediate the financial stress on our customers as a result of the pandemic, we may experience an increase in delinquencies that could materially and adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition in future periods.\nLegal and regulatory responses to concerns about COVID-19 could result in additional regulation or restrictions affecting the conduct of our business in the future. All of the foregoing may adversely affect our income and other results of operations, make collection of our personal loans more difficult, or reduce income received from such loans or our ability to obtain financing with respect to such loans.\nFinally, to the extent that the pandemic harms our business and results of operations, many of the other risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section may be heightened.\nOur results of operations and financial condition and our borrowers\u2019 ability to make payments on their loans have been, and may in the future be, adversely affected by economic conditions and other factors that we cannot control.\nUncertainty and deterioration in general economic conditions in the U.S. and abroad historically have created a difficult operating environment for consumer lending. Many factors, including factors that are beyond our control, may impact our results of operations or financial condition and/or affect our borrowers\u2019 willingness or capacity to make payments on their loans. These factors include: unemployment levels, housing markets, energy costs and interest rates; events such as natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism, catastrophes; events that affect our borrowers, such as major medical expenses, divorce or death; and the quality of any collateral underlying our finance receivables. If we experience a future economic downturn, or if we become affected by other events beyond our control, we may experience increased credit risks, significant reductions in revenues, earnings and cash flows, difficulties accessing capital and a deterioration in the value of our investments.\nMoreover, our customers are primarily non-prime borrowers, who have historically been more likely to be affected, or more severely affected, by adverse macroeconomic conditions than prime borrowers. If a borrower defaults under a finance receivable held directly by us, we will bear a risk of loss of principal to the extent of any deficiency between the value of the collateral, if any, and the outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest on the finance receivable, which could adversely affect our cash flows from operations. The cost to service our loans may also increase without a corresponding increase in our finance charge income.\nWe also are exposed to geographic customer concentration risk. An economic downturn or catastrophic event that disproportionately affects certain geographic regions could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, including the performance of our finance receivables portfolio. See Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for quantification of our largest concentrations of net finance receivables.\nWe cannot assure you that our policies and procedures for underwriting, processing and servicing loans will adequately adapt to adverse economic or other changes. If we fail to adapt to changing economic conditions or other factors, or if such changes adversely affect our borrowers\u2019 willingness or capacity to repay their loans, our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity would be materially adversely affected.\nThere are risks associated with the acquisition or sale of assets or businesses and the formation, termination or operation of joint ventures or other strategic alliances, including the possibility of increased delinquencies and losses, difficulties with integrating loans into our servicing platform and disruption to our ongoing business, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nWe have previously acquired, and in the future may acquire, assets or businesses, including large portfolios of finance receivables, either through the direct purchase of such assets or the purchase of the equity of a company with such a portfolio. Since we will not have originated or serviced the loans we acquire, we may not be aware of legal or other deficiencies related to origination or servicing, and our review of the portfolio prior to purchase may not uncover those deficiencies. Further, we may have limited recourse against the seller of the portfolio.\nPotential difficulties we may encounter in connection with these transactions and arrangements include, but are not limited to, the following: the integration of the assets or business into our information technology platforms and servicing systems; the quality of servicing; disruption of our ongoing businesses and distraction of our management teams; incomplete or inaccurate records; inability to retain existing customers; unanticipated expenses; and potential unknown liabilities associated with the transactions, including legal liability related to origination and servicing prior to the acquisition.\nThe anticipated benefits and synergies of our future acquisitions will assume a successful integration, and will be based on projections, which are inherently uncertain, as well as other assumptions. Even if integration is successful, anticipated benefits and synergies may not be achieved.\nIf our estimates of allowance for finance receivable losses are not adequate to absorb actual losses, our provision for finance receivable losses would increase, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe maintain an allowance for finance receivable losses. To estimate the appropriate level of allowance for finance receivable losses, we consider known and relevant internal and external factors that affect finance receivable collectability, including the total amount of finance receivables outstanding, historical finance receivable charge-offs, our current collection patterns, and current and forecasted economic trends. Our methodology for establishing our allowance for finance receivable losses is based on the guidance from Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, which requires us to measure expected credit losses for financial assets at each reporting date. The allowance is primarily based on historical experience, current conditions, and our reasonable and supportable forecast of economic conditions. If customer behavior changes as a result of economic conditions and if we are unable to accurately predict how the unemployment rates, personal bankruptcy filings, and general economic conditions may affect our allowance for finance receivable losses, our allowance for finance receivable losses may be inadequate. Our allowance for finance receivable losses is an estimate, and if actual finance receivable losses are materially greater than our allowance for finance receivable losses, our results of operations could be adversely affected. Neither state regulators nor federal regulators regulate our allowance for finance receivable losses.\nOur risk management efforts may not be effective.\nWe could incur substantial losses and our business operations could be disrupted if we are unable to effectively identify, manage, monitor, and mitigate financial risks, such as credit risk, interest rate risk, prepayment risk, liquidity risk, and other market-related risks, as well as operational risks related to our business, assets and liabilities. To the extent our models used to assess the creditworthiness of potential borrowers do not adequately identify potential risks, the valuations produced will not adequately represent the risk profile of the borrowers and could result in a riskier finance receivables profile than originally identified. Our risk management policies, procedures, and techniques, including our scoring technology, may not be sufficient to identify all of the risks we are exposed to, mitigate the risks we have identified or identify concentrations of risk or additional risks to which we may become subject in the future. We also face new risks as a result of COVID-19 and the significant increase in our remote work force and digital operations. These risks may not be adequately captured by our existing risk management framework.\nChanges in market conditions, including rising interest rates, could adversely affect the rate at which our borrowers prepay their loans and the value of our finance receivables portfolio, as well as increase our financing cost, which could negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nChanging market conditions, the availability of credit, the relative economic vitality of the area in which our borrowers and their assets are located, changes in tax laws, other opportunities for investment available to our customers, homeowner mobility, and other economic, social, geographic, demographic, and legal factors beyond our control, may affect the rates at which our borrowers prepay their loans. Generally, in situations where prepayment rates have slowed, the weighted-average life of our finance receivables has increased. Any increase in interest rates may further slow the rate of prepayment for our finance receivables, which could adversely affect our liquidity by reducing the cash flows from, and the value of, the finance receivables we hold for sale or utilize as collateral in our secured funding transactions.\nMoreover, our finance receivables are fixed-rate and generally decline in value if interest rates increase. As such, if changing market conditions cause interest rates to increase substantially, the value of our finance receivables could decline. Some jurisdictions limit the maximum interest rate that we may charge on a certain population of our loans so we have limited ability to increase the interest rate on our loans made in those jurisdictions. Our yield, as well as our cash flows from operations and results of operations, could be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to increase the interest rates charged on new loans to offset any increases in our cost of funds. Accordingly, any increase in interest rates could negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nWe may be required to indemnify or repurchase finance receivables from purchasers of finance receivables that we have sold or securitized, or which we will sell or securitize in the future, if our finance receivables fail to meet certain criteria or characteristics or under other circumstances, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nThe documents governing our finance receivable sales and securitizations contain provisions that require us to indemnify the purchasers of securitized finance receivables, or to repurchase the affected finance receivables, under certain circumstances. While our sale and securitization documents vary, they generally contain customary provisions that may require us to repurchase finance receivables if:\n\u2022our representations and warranties concerning the quality and characteristics of the finance receivable are inaccurate;\n\u2022there is borrower fraud; or\n\u2022we fail to comply, at the individual finance receivable level or otherwise, with regulatory requirements in connection with the origination and servicing of the finance receivables.\nAt its maximum, our exposure to repurchases or our indemnification obligations under our representations and warranties could include the current unpaid balance of all finance receivables that we have sold or securitized, and which are not subject to settlement agreements with purchasers.\nThe risk of loss on the finance receivables that we have securitized is recognized in our allowance for finance receivable losses since all of our loan securitizations are recorded on our balance sheet. If we are required to indemnify purchasers or repurchase finance receivables that we sell or have sold that result in losses or recognize losses on securitized finance receivables that exceed our recorded allowance for finance receivable losses associated with our securitizations, this could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nOur business and reputation may be materially impacted by information system failures, cyber threats, or network disruptions.\nOur business relies heavily on information systems to deliver products and services to our customers, and to manage our ongoing operations. These systems may encounter service disruptions due to system, network or software failure, security breaches, computer viruses, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, physical or electronic break-ins, or other events or disruptions. In addition, denial-of-service attacks could overwhelm our internet sites and prevent us from adequately serving customers. Cyber threats are constantly evolving, increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. We also may face new or heightened risk due to the increase in our remote workforce and digital operations. We may have no current capability to detect certain vulnerabilities, which may allow them to persist in our system environment over long periods of time. Cyber threats can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across our computer systems and networks and those of our third-party vendors. System redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate, and our business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient to adequately address the disruption. A disruption could impair our ability to offer and process our loans, provide customer service, perform collections or other necessary business activities, which could result in a loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, or otherwise materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nThere may be losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information, including personally identifiable information, that could subject us to significant reputational, financial, legal and operational consequences.\nOur operations rely heavily on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential customer and other information including, among other things, PII, in our computer systems and networks, as well as those of third parties. Our branch offices and centralized servicing centers, as well as our administrative and executive offices, are part of an electronic information network that is designed to permit us to originate and track finance receivables and collections and perform other tasks that are part of our everyday operations. Additionally, as a result of COVID-19 and the significant increase in our remote work force and digital operations, our vulnerability to unauthorized access to confidential information may increase.\nWe devote significant resources to network and data security, including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect our computer systems and data. These security measures may not be sufficient and may be vulnerable to hacking, employee error, malfeasance, system error, faulty password management or other irregularities. For example, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing usernames, passwords or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access our computer systems. Any failure, interruption, or breach in our cyber security could result in reputational harm, disruption of our customer relationships, or our inability to originate, process and service our finance receivable products.\nFurther, any of these cyber security and operational risks could expose us to lawsuits by customers for identity theft or other damages resulting from data breach involving PII or misuse of their PII and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. In addition, regulators may impose penalties and/or require remedial action if they identify weaknesses in our security systems, and we may be required to incur significant costs to increase our cyber security to address any vulnerabilities that may be discovered or to remediate the harm caused by any security breaches. As part of our business, we may share confidential customer information and proprietary information with customers, vendors, service providers, and business partners. The information systems of these third parties may be vulnerable to security breaches and, despite our best efforts, we may not be able to ensure that these third parties have appropriate security controls in place to protect the information we share with them. If our confidential information is intercepted, stolen, misused, or mishandled while in possession of a third party, it could result in reputational harm to us, loss of customer business, and additional regulatory scrutiny, and it could expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Although we have insurance that is intended to cover certain losses from such events, there can be no assurance that such insurance will be adequate or available.\nWe are also subject to the theft or misuse of physical customer and employee records at our facilities.\nOur branch offices and centralized servicing centers have physical customer records necessary for day-to-day operations that contain confidential information about our customers. We also retain physical records in various storage locations. The loss or theft of customer information from our branch offices, central servicing facilities, or other storage locations could subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and penalties and could expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, which could\nhave a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. In addition, if we cannot locate original documents (or copies, in some cases) for certain finance receivables, we may not be able to collect on those finance receivables.\nOur insurance operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including claims, catastrophic events, underwriting risks and dependence on a primary distribution channel.\nInsurance claims and policyholder liabilities are difficult to predict and may exceed the related reserves set aside for claims (losses) and associated expenses for claims adjudication (loss adjustment expenses). Additionally, events such as natural disasters, pandemic disease, cyber security breaches and other types of catastrophes, and prolonged economic downturns, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Other risks relating to our insurance operations include changes to laws and regulations applicable to us, as well as changes to the regulatory environment, such as: changes to laws or regulations affecting capital and reserve requirements; frequency and type of regulatory monitoring and reporting; consumer privacy, use of customer data and data security; benefits or loss ratio requirements; insurance producer licensing or appointment requirements; required disclosures to consumers; and collateral protection insurance (i.e., insurance some of our lender companies purchase, at the customer\u2019s expense, on that customer\u2019s loan collateral for the periods of time the customer fails to adequately, as required by the customer's loan, insure the collateral). Because our customers do not directly agree to the amount charged for collateral protection at the time it is purchased, regulators may in the future prohibit our insurance companies from providing this insurance to our lending operations. Moreover, our insurance companies are predominately dependent on our lending operations as the primary source of business and product distribution. If our lending operations discontinue offering insurance products, including as a result of regulatory requirements or rate caps, our insurance operations would need to find an alternate distribution partner for their products, of which there can be no assurance.\nOur use of derivatives exposes us to credit and market risks.\nFrom time to time, we may enter into derivative financial instruments for economic hedging purposes, such as managing our exposure to interest rate risk. By using derivative instruments, we are exposed to credit and market risks, including the risk of loss associated with variations in the spread between the asset yield and the funding and/or hedge cost, default risk, and the risk of insolvency or other inability of the counterparty to a particular derivative financial instrument to perform its obligations.\nWe may not be able to make technological improvements as quickly as some of our competitors, which could harm our ability to compete and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nThe financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes, with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial and lending institutions to better serve customers and reduce costs. Our future success and, in particular, the success of our centralized operations, will depend, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services as quickly as some of our competitors or be successful in marketing these products and services to our existing and new customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could harm our ability to compete with our competitors and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nIf goodwill and other intangible assets become impaired, it could have a negative impact on our profitability.\nGoodwill represents the amount of acquisition cost over the fair value of net assets we acquired. If the carrying amount of goodwill and other intangible assets exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Any such adjustments are reflected in our results of operations in the periods in which the impairments become known. There can be no assurance that our future evaluations of goodwill and other intangible assets will not result in findings of impairments and related write-downs, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. See Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.\nDamage to our reputation could adversely impact our business and financial results.\nOur ability to attract and retain customers and employees is significantly impacted by our reputation. Damage to our reputation can arise from a number of circumstances as a result of our actions or those of our employees or as a result of negative public opinion about the financial services industry generally. Negative public opinion can result from a number of sources, such as our lending practices, cybersecurity breaches, failures to safeguard personal information, discriminating or harassing behavior of employees toward other employees or customers, compensation practices, sales practices, environmental, social, and governance practices and disclosures, failure or perceived failure of us, our customers, or other parties to comply with laws or regulations, including companies we have made investments, and vendors with which we do business. Such negative attention and publicity directed at us could generate dissatisfaction among our customers and employees. Although we have policies and procedures in place intended to prevent and detect conduct by team members and third-party service providers that could potentially harm customers or our reputation, we cannot assure you that such policies and procedures will be fully effective in preventing such conduct. Furthermore, our actual or perceived failure to address or prevent any such conduct or otherwise to effectively manage our business or operations could result in significant reputational harm.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRY AND REGULATION\nWe operate in a highly competitive market, and we cannot ensure that the competitive pressures we face will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nThe consumer finance industry is highly competitive. Our profitability depends, in large part, on our ability to underwrite and originate finance receivables. We compete with other consumer finance companies as well as other types of financial institutions that offer similar consumer financial products and services. Some of these competitors may have greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we possess. Some competitors may also have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that may not be available to us. Banks and credit card companies, which had focused largely on prime customers following the financial crisis, have resumed lending to non-prime customers. This shift could increase competition in the markets in which we operate. Increased regulatory pressure on payday lenders could cause many of those lenders to start making more traditional installment consumer loans in order to reduce regulatory scrutiny of their practices. We cannot assure you that the competitive pressures we face will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nOur businesses are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business and failure to comply with such regulations may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nOur businesses are subject to numerous federal, state, and local laws and regulations, and various state authorities regulate and supervise our insurance operations. The laws under which a substantial amount of our consumer and real estate businesses are conducted generally: provide for state licensing of lenders and, in some cases, licensing of employees involved in real estate loans, including loan modifications; impose limits on the terms of consumer credit, including amounts, interest rates and charges; regulate whether and under what circumstances insurance and other optional products may be offered to consumers in connection with a consumer credit transaction; regulate the manner in which we use personal data; and provide for other consumer protections.\nWe are also subject to extensive servicing regulations with which we must comply when servicing our legacy real estate loans and servicing loan portfolios on behalf of other parties. Additionally, we will have to comply with these servicing regulations if we acquire loan portfolios in the future and assume the servicing obligations for the acquired loans or other financial assets. The extent of state regulation of our insurance business varies by product and by jurisdiction, but relates primarily to the following: licensing; conduct of business; periodic examination of the affairs of insurers; form and content of required financial reports; standards of solvency; limitations on dividend payments and other affiliate transactions; types of products offered; approval of policy forms and premium rates; formulas to calculate any unearned premium refund due to an insured customer; permissible investments; deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders; reserve requirements for unearned premiums, losses and other purposes; and claims processing.\nAll of our operations are subject to regular examination by state regulators and, certain aspects of our business, by federal regulators. As a whole, our entities are subject to several hundred regulatory examinations in a given year. These examinations may result in requirements to change our policies or practices, and in some cases, we are required to pay monetary fines or make reimbursements to customers. Many state regulators and some federal regulators have indicated an intention to pool their resources in order to conduct examinations of licensed entities, including us, at the same time (referred to as a \u201cmulti-state\u201d examination). This could result in more in-depth examinations, which could be costlier and lead to more significant\nenforcement actions.\nWe are also subject to potential enforcement, supervisions and other actions that may be brought by state attorneys general or other state enforcement authorities and other governmental agencies. Any such actions could subject us to civil money penalties, customer remediation and increased compliance costs, as well as damage our reputation and brand and could limit or prohibit our ability to offer certain products and services or engage in certain business practices.\nState attorneys general have stated their intention to fill any void left by diminished CFPB enforcement and have a variety of tools at their disposal to enforce state and federal consumer financial laws. First, Section 1042 of the Dodd-Frank Act grants state attorneys general the ability to enforce the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations promulgated under the Dodd-Frank Act\u2019s authority and to secure remedies provided in the Dodd-Frank Act against entities within their jurisdiction. State attorneys general also have enforcement authority under state law with respect to unfair or deceptive practices. Generally, under these statutes, state attorneys general may conduct investigations, bring actions, and recover civil penalties or obtain injunctive relief against entities engaging in unfair, deceptive, or fraudulent acts. Attorneys general may also coordinate among themselves to enter into multi-state actions or settlements. Then, several consumer financial laws like the Truth in Lending Act and Fair Credit Reporting Act grant enforcement or litigation authority to state attorneys general. If there is a perception of diminished CFPB enforcement, there may be an increase in actions brought by state attorneys general.\nWe are subject to potential changes in federal and state law, which could lower the interest-rate limit that non-depository financial institutions may charge for consumer loans or could expand the definition of interest under federal and state law to include the cost of optional products, such as insurance. Such changes could limit our interest income, insurance revenues, and other revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe believe that we maintain all material licenses and permits required for our current operations and are in substantial compliance with all applicable federal, state and local regulations, but we may not be able to maintain all requisite licenses and permits, and the failure to satisfy those and other regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our operations. In addition, changes in laws or regulations applicable to us could subject us to additional licensing, registration and other regulatory requirements in the future or could adversely affect our ability to operate or the manner in which we conduct business.\nA material failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in regulatory actions, including substantial fines or penalties, lawsuits and damage to our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nFor more information with respect to the regulatory framework affecting our businesses, see \u201cBusiness-Regulation\u201d included in this report.\nRequirements of the Dodd-Frank Act and oversight by the CFPB significantly increase our regulatory costs and burdens.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act was adopted in 2010. This law and the related regulations affect our operations in terms of increased oversight of financial services products by the CFPB, and the imposition of restrictions on the allowable terms for certain consumer credit transactions. The CFPB has significant authority to implement and enforce federal consumer finance laws, including the Truth in Lending Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Billing Act and new requirements for financial services products provided for in the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as the authority to identify and prohibit unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts and practices. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act provides the CFPB with broad supervisory, examination and enforcement authority over various consumer financial products and services, including the ability to require reimbursements and other payments to customers for alleged legal violations, and to impose significant penalties, as well as injunctive relief that prohibits lenders from engaging in allegedly unlawful practices. Further, state attorneys general and state regulators are authorized to bring civil actions to enforce certain consumer protection provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The industry investigation and enforcement provisions of Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act may adversely affect our business if the CFPB or one or more state attorneys general or state regulators believe that we have violated any federal consumer financial protection laws, including the prohibition in Title X against unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices.\nThe CFPB currently has supervisory authority over our real estate servicing activities, and may in the future have supervisory authority over at least portions of our consumer lending business. It also has the authority to bring enforcement actions for violations of laws over which it has jurisdiction regardless of whether it has supervisory authority for a given product or service. Effective in January 2014, the CFPB finalized mortgage servicing regulations, which makes it more difficult and expensive to service mortgages. The Dodd-Frank Act also gives the CFPB supervisory authority over entities that are\ndesignated as \u201clarger participants\u201d in certain financial services markets. The CFPB has published regulations for \u201clarger participants\u201d in the market of auto finance, and we have been designated as a larger participant in this market. The larger-participant rule for consumer installment loans was one of the rulemaking initiatives the CFPB designated as inactive in its Spring 2018 rulemaking agenda. It is not known if or when the CFPB may consider reactivating the rulemaking process for the larger participant rule for consumer installment loans. The CFPB\u2019s broad supervisory and enforcement powers could affect our business and operations significantly in terms of increased operating and regulatory compliance costs, and limits on the types of products we offer and the manner in which they are offered, among other things. See \u201cBusiness-Regulation\u201d included in this report for further information on the CFPB.\nThe CFPB and certain state regulators have acted against some lenders regarding, for instance, debt collection and the marketing of optional products offered by the lenders in connection with their loans. The products included debt cancellation/suspension products and other types of payment protection insurance. We collect on delinquent debt. We also sell optional insurance and non-insurance products in connection with our loans. Our debt collection practices and sales of optional insurance and non-insurance products could be challenged in a similar manner by the CFPB or state consumer lending regulators.\nSome of the rulemaking under the Dodd-Frank Act remains to be done. As a result, the complete impact of the Dodd-Frank Act remains uncertain. It is not clear what form remaining regulations will ultimately take, or how our business will be affected. No assurance can be given that the Dodd-Frank Act and related regulations or any other new legislative changes enacted will not have a significant impact on our business.\nFor more information with respect to the regulatory framework affecting our businesses, see \u201cBusiness-Regulation\u201d included in this report.\nCurrent and proposed regulations relating to consumer privacy, data protection and information security could increase our costs.\nWe are subject to a number of federal and state consumer privacy, data protection, and information security laws and regulations. For example, we are subject to the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which governs the use of PII by financial institutions. Moreover, various state laws and regulations may require us to notify customers, employees, state attorneys general, regulators and others in the event of a security breach. Federal and state legislators and regulators are increasingly pursuing new guidance, laws, and regulations relating to consumer privacy, data protection and information security. Compliance with current or future consumer privacy, data protection, and information security laws and regulations could result in higher compliance, technology or other operating costs. Any violations of these laws and regulations may require us to change our business practices or operational structure, and could subject us to material legal claims, monetary penalties, sanctions, and the obligation to compensate and/or notify customers, employees, state attorneys general, regulators and others or take other remedial actions.\nOur use of third-party vendors is subject to regulatory review.\nRecently, the CFPB and other regulators have issued regulatory guidance focusing on the need for financial institutions to perform due diligence and ongoing monitoring of third-party vendor relationships which increases the scope of management involvement and decreases the benefit that we receive from using third-party vendors. Moreover, if our regulators conclude that we have not met the standards for oversight of our third-party vendors, we could be subject to enforcement actions, civil monetary penalties, supervisory orders to cease and desist or other remedial actions, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition and operating results. Further, federal and state regulators have been scrutinizing the practices of lead aggregators and providers recently. If regulators place restrictions on certain practices by lead aggregators or providers, our ability to use them as a source for applicants could be affected.\nWe purchase and sell finance receivables, including charged-off receivables and receivables where the borrower is in default. This practice could subject us to heightened regulatory scrutiny, which may expose us to legal action, cause us to incur losses and/or limit or impede our collection activity.\nAs part of our business model, we purchase and sell finance receivables. Although the borrowers for some of these finance receivables are current on their payments, other borrowers may be in default (including in bankruptcy) or the debt may have been charged off as uncollectible. Recently, the CFPB and other regulators have significantly increased their scrutiny of the purchase and sale of debt, and collections practices undertaken by purchasers of debt, especially delinquent and charged-off debt. The CFPB has scrutinized sellers of debt for not maintaining sufficient documentation to support and verify the validity or\namount of the debt. It has also scrutinized debt collectors for, among other things, their collection tactics, attempting to collect debts that no longer are valid, misrepresenting the amount of the debt and not having sufficient documentation to verify the validity or amount of the debt. Our purchases or sales of receivables could expose us to lawsuits or fines by regulators if we do not have sufficient documentation to support and verify the validity and amount of the finance receivables underlying these transactions, or if we or purchasers of our finance receivables use collection methods that are viewed as unfair or abusive. In addition, our collections could suffer, and we may incur additional expenses if we are required to change collection practices or stop collecting on certain debts as a result of a lawsuit or action on the part of regulators.\nChanges in law and regulatory developments could result in significant additional compliance costs relating to securitizations.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act and related rulemaking and regulatory developments has resulted, and will continue to result, in the incurrence of additional compliance costs in connection with securitization transactions. The Dodd-Frank Act requires, among other things, that a securitizer retain at least a 5% economic interest in the credit risk of the securitized assets; this requirement has reduced and will continue to reduce the amount of financing obtained from such transactions. Furthermore, sponsors are prohibited from diluting the required risk retention by dividing the economic interest among multiple parties or hedging or transferring the credit risk the sponsor is required to maintain.\nRules relating to securitizations rated by nationally-recognized statistical rating agencies require that the findings of any third-party due diligence service providers be made publicly available at least five (5) business days prior to the first sale of securities, which has led and will continue to lead us to incur additional costs in connection with each securitization.\nWe may have to constrain our business activities to avoid being deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act.\nThe Investment Company Act imposes a regulatory regime that regulates the manner in which \u201cinvestment companies\u201d are permitted to conduct their business activities. We believe we have conducted, and intend to continue to conduct, our business in a manner that does not result in the Company being characterized as an investment company, including relying on certain exemptions from registration as an investment company. We rely on guidance published by the SEC staff or on our analyses of such guidance to determine our qualification under these and other exemptions. To the extent that the SEC staff publishes new or different guidance with respect to these matters, we may be required to adjust our business operations accordingly. Any additional guidance from the SEC staff could provide additional flexibility to us, or it could inhibit our ability to conduct our business operations. We cannot assure you that the laws and regulations governing our Investment Company Act status or SEC guidance regarding the Investment Company Act will not change in a manner that adversely affects our operations. If we are deemed to be an investment company, we may attempt to seek exempting relief from the SEC, which could impose significant costs and delays on our business. We may not receive such relief on a timely basis, if at all, and such relief may require us to modify or curtail our operations. If we are deemed to be an investment company, we may also be required to institute burdensome compliance requirements and our activities may be restricted.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR INDEBTEDNESS\nAn inability to access adequate sources of liquidity may adversely affect our ability to fund operational requirements and satisfy financial obligations.\nOur ability to access capital and credit may be significantly affected by disruption in the U.S. credit markets and the associated credit rating downgrades on our debt. In addition, the risk of volatility surrounding the global economic system and uncertainty surrounding regulatory reforms, such as the Dodd-Frank Act, continue to create uncertainty around access to the capital markets. Historically, we have funded our operations and repaid our debt and other obligations using funds collected from our finance receivable portfolio and new debt issuances. Our current corporate credit ratings are below investment grade and, as a result, our borrowing costs may further increase and our ability to borrow may be limited. In addition to issuing unsecured debt in the public and private markets, we have raised capital through securitization transactions and, although there can be no assurances that we will be able to complete additional securitizations or issue additional unsecured debt, we currently expect our near-term sources of capital markets funding to continue to derive from securitization transactions and unsecured debt offerings.\nAny future capital markets transactions will be dependent on our financial performance as well as market conditions, which may result in receiving financing on terms less favorable to us than our existing financings. In addition, our access to future\nfinancing and our ability to refinance existing debt will depend on a variety of factors such as our financial performance, the general availability of credit, our credit ratings and credit capacity at the time we pursue such financing.\nIf we are unable to complete additional securitization transactions or unsecured debt offerings on a timely basis or upon terms acceptable to us or otherwise access adequate sources of liquidity, our ability to fund our own operational requirements and satisfy financial obligations may be adversely affected.\nOur indebtedness is significant, which could affect our ability to meet our obligations under our debt instruments and could materially and adversely affect our business and ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry.\nOur significant indebtedness could have important consequences, including the following:\n\u2022it may require us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flows from operations to the payment of our indebtedness, which reduces the funds available for other purposes, including finance receivable originations and capital returns;\n\u2022it could limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures and reduce our flexibility in responding to changing regulatory, business and economic conditions;\n\u2022it may limit our ability to incur additional borrowings or securitizations for working capital, capital expenditures, business development, debt service requirements, acquisitions or general corporate or other purposes, or to refinance our indebtedness;\n\u2022it may require us to seek to change the maturity, interest rate and other terms of our existing debt;\n\u2022it may place us at a competitive disadvantage to competitors that are not as highly leveraged;\n\u2022it may cause a downgrade of our debt and long-term corporate ratings; and\n\u2022it may cause us to be more vulnerable to periods of negative or slow growth in the general economy or in our business.\nIn addition, meeting our anticipated liquidity requirements is contingent upon our continued compliance with our existing debt agreements. An event of default or declaration of acceleration under one of our existing debt agreements could also result in an event of default and declaration of acceleration under certain of our other existing debt agreements. Such an acceleration of our debt would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our ability to continue as a going concern. If our debt obligations increase, whether due to the increased cost of existing indebtedness or the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the consequences described above could be magnified. There can be no assurance that we will be able to repay or refinance our debt in the future.\nCertain of our outstanding notes contain covenants that restrict our operations and may inhibit our ability to grow our business and increase revenues.\nOMFC\u2019s indenture and certain of OMFC\u2019s notes contain a covenant that limits OMFC\u2019s and its subsidiaries\u2019 ability to create or incur liens. The restrictions may interfere with our ability to obtain additional financing or may affect the manner in which we structure such financing or engage in other business activities, which may significantly limit or harm our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. A default and resulting acceleration of obligations could also result in an event of default and declaration of acceleration under certain of our other existing debt agreements. Such an acceleration of our debt would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our ability to continue as a going concern. A default could also significantly limit our alternatives to refinance the debt under which the default occurred as well as other indebtedness. This limitation may significantly restrict our financing options during times of either market distress or our financial distress, which are precisely the times when having financing options is most important.\nThe assessment of our liquidity is based upon significant judgments and estimates that could prove to be materially incorrect.\nIn assessing our current financial position and developing operating plans for the future, management has made significant judgments and estimates with respect to our liquidity, including but not limited to:\n\u2022our ability to generate sufficient cash to service all of our outstanding debt;\n\u2022our continued ability to access debt and securitization markets and other sources of funding on favorable terms;\n\u2022our ability to complete on favorable terms, as needed, additional borrowings, securitizations, finance receivable portfolio sales, or other transactions to support liquidity, and the costs associated with these funding sources,\nincluding sales at less than carrying value and limits on the types of assets that can be securitized or sold, which would affect our profitability;\n\u2022the potential for downgrade of our debt by rating agencies, which would have a negative impact on our cost of, and access to, capital;\n\u2022our ability to comply with our debt covenants;\n\u2022our ability to make capital returns to OMH's stockholders;\n\u2022the amount of cash expected to be received from our finance receivable portfolio through collections (including prepayments) and receipt of finance charges, which could be materially different than our estimates;\n\u2022the potential for declining financial flexibility and reduced income should we use more of our assets for securitizations and finance receivable portfolio sales; and\n\u2022the potential for reduced income due to the possible deterioration of the credit quality of our finance receivable portfolios.\nAdditionally, there are numerous risks to our financial results, liquidity, and capital raising and debt refinancing plans that are not quantified in our current liquidity forecasts. These risks include, but are not limited, to the following:\n\u2022our inability to grow our personal loan portfolio with adequate profitability to fund operations, loan losses, and other expenses;\n\u2022our inability to monetize assets including, but not limited to, our access to debt and securitization markets;\n\u2022our inability to obtain the additional necessary funding to finance our operations;\n\u2022the effect of current and potential new federal, state and local laws, regulations, or regulatory policies and practices on our ability to conduct business or the manner in which we conduct business, as well as changes that may result from increased regulatory scrutiny of the sub-prime lending industry;\n\u2022potential liability relating to real estate and personal loans which we have sold or may sell in the future, or relating to securitized loans, if it is determined that there was a non-curable breach of a warranty made in connection with the transaction;\n\u2022the potential for increasing costs and difficulty in servicing our loan portfolio as a result of heightened regulatory scrutiny of loan servicing and foreclosure practices in the industry generally;\n\u2022the potential for additional unforeseen cash demands or acceleration of obligations;\n\u2022reduced income due to loan modifications where the borrower\u2019s interest rate is reduced, principal payments are deferred, or other concessions are made;\n\u2022the potential for declines or volatility in bond and equity markets; and\n\u2022the potential effect on us if the capital levels of our regulated and unregulated subsidiaries prove inadequate to support our current business plans.\nThe actual outcome of one or more of our plans could be materially different than expected or one or more of our significant judgments or estimates about the potential effects of these risks and uncertainties could prove to be materially incorrect. In the event of such an occurrence, if third-party financing is not available, our liquidity could be materially adversely affected, and as a result, substantial doubt could exist about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOMFC's credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to raise capital in the debt markets at attractive rates, which could negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nS&P, Moody\u2019s, and KBRA rate OMFC\u2019s debt. Ratings reflect the rating agencies\u2019 opinions of a company\u2019s financial strength, operating performance, strategic position and ability to meet its obligations. Agency ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any security, and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the issuing organization. Each agency\u2019s rating should be evaluated independently of any other agency\u2019s rating.\nThe table below outlines OMFC\u2019s long-term corporate debt ratings and outlook by rating agencies:\nCurrently, no other entity has a corporate debt rating, though they may be rated in the future.\nIf OMFC\u2019s current ratings are downgraded, it will likely increase the interest rate that we would have to pay to raise money in the capital markets, making it more expensive for us to borrow money and adversely impacting our access to capital. As a result, a downgrade of OMFC's ratings could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nOur securitizations may expose us to financing and other risks, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to access the securitization market in the future, which may require us to seek more costly financing.\nAlthough we have successfully completed a number of securitizations since 2013, we can give no assurances that we will be able to complete additional securitizations if the securitization markets become constrained. In addition, the value of any subordinated securities that we may retain in our securitizations might be reduced or, in some cases, eliminated as a result of an adverse change in economic conditions or the financial markets.\nOMFC, OMFG, and OMFH currently act as the servicers with respect to the personal loan securitization trusts and related series of asset-backed securities. If OMFC, OMFG, or OMFH defaults in its servicing obligations, an early amortization event could occur with respect to the relevant asset-backed securities and OMFC, OMFG, or OMFH, as applicable, could be replaced as servicer. Servicer defaults include, for example, the failure of the servicer to make any payment, transfer or deposit in accordance with the securitization documents, a breach of representations, warranties or agreements made by the servicer under the securitization documents and the occurrence of certain insolvency events with respect to the servicer. Such an early amortization event could damage our reputation and have materially adverse consequences on our liquidity and cost of funds.\nRating agencies may also affect our ability to execute a securitization transaction or increase the costs we expect to incur from executing securitization transactions, not only by deciding not to issue ratings for our securitization transactions, but also by altering the criteria and process they follow in issuing ratings. Rating agencies could alter their ratings processes or criteria after we have accumulated finance receivables for securitization in a manner that effectively reduces the value of those finance receivables by increasing our financing costs or otherwise requiring that we incur additional costs to comply with those processes and criteria. We have no ability to control or predict what actions the rating agencies may take in this regard.\nFurther, other matters, such as (i) accounting standards applicable to securitization transactions and (ii) capital and leverage requirements applicable to banks and other regulated financial institutions' asset-backed securities, could result in decreased investor demand for securities issued through our securitization transactions, or increased competition from other institutions that undertake securitization transactions. In addition, compliance with certain regulatory requirements, including the Dodd-Frank Act and the Investment Company Act, may affect the type of securitizations that we are able to complete.\nIf it is not possible or economical for us to securitize our finance receivables in the future, we would need to seek alternative financing to support our operations and to meet our existing debt obligations, which may be less efficient and more expensive than raising capital via securitizations and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR ORGANIZATION AND STRUCTURE\nThe Apollo-V\u00e4rde Group is OMH's largest stockholder, and may exercise significant influence over us, including through its ability to designate a majority of the members of the board of directors, and its interests may conflict with the interests of OMH's other stockholders.\nThe Apollo-V\u00e4rde Group's holdings represent approximately 40.9% of OMH's outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2020. The Apollo-V\u00e4rde Group is OMH's largest stockholder and has significant influence on all matters requiring a stockholder vote. This concentration of ownership may delay, deter or prevent acts that would be favored by OMH's other stockholders, including delaying, preventing or deterring a change in control of OMH or a merger, takeover or other business combination that may be otherwise favorable to us or OMH's other stockholders. As a result, stockholders might not receive a premium over the then-current market price of OMH's common stock upon a change in control. See additional information under \u201cBusiness Overview\u201d in Item 1 of this report.\nIn connection with the closing of the Apollo-V\u00e4rde Transaction, OMH entered into an Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement, which provides the Apollo-V\u00e4rde Group with the right to designate a majority of the members of the board of directors, plus one director, for so long as the Apollo-V\u00e4rde Group and certain of its affiliates and\npermitted transferees continue to beneficially own, directly or indirectly, at least 33% of OMH's issued and outstanding common stock. With such representation on the board of directors, the Apollo-V\u00e4rde Group is able to exercise significant influence over decisions affecting OMH, including its direction and policies, the appointment of management and any action requiring the vote of its board of directors. The interests of the Apollo-V\u00e4rde Group may not always coincide with OMH's interests or the interests of OMH's other stockholders. The Apollo-V\u00e4rde Group may seek to cause OMH to take courses of action that, in its judgment, could enhance its investment in OMH, but which might involve risks or adversely affect OMH or its other stockholders. The terms of the Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement are further described in OMH's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on June 25, 2018. The Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to that Current Report on Form 8-K, and such Current Report on Form 8-K, including Exhibit 10.1 thereto, is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.\nIn addition, the Apollo-V\u00e4rde Group and its affiliates may conduct business with any business that is competitive or in the same line of business as us, do business with any of our clients, customers or vendors, make investments in the kind of property in which we may make investments or acquire the same or similar types of assets that we may seek to acquire and may in the future acquire interests in or provide advice to businesses that directly or indirectly compete with our business or are vendors or customers.\nOMH and OMFC are holding companies with no operations and rely on our operating subsidiaries to provide us with funds necessary to meet our financial obligations and enable us to pay dividends.\nOur principal assets are the equity interests we directly or indirectly hold in our operating subsidiaries, which own our operating assets. As a result, we are dependent on loans, dividends and other payments from our subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to meet our financial obligations and enable OMH to pay dividends on its common stock. Our subsidiaries are legally distinct from us and certain of our subsidiaries are prohibited or restricted from paying dividends or otherwise making funds available to us under certain conditions. For example, our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulations that limit their ability to pay dividends or make loans or advances to us, principally to protect policyholders, and certain of OMFC's debt agreements limit the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to pay dividends. If we are unable to obtain funds from our subsidiaries, or if our subsidiaries do not generate sufficient cash from operations, we may be unable to meet our financial obligations or pay dividends, and the board may exercise its discretion not to pay dividends.\nOMH may not pay dividends on its common stock in the future, even if liquidity and leverage targets are met.\nWhile OMH intends to pay its minimum quarterly dividends, currently $0.45 per share, for the foreseeable future, and has announced its intention to evaluate dividends above the minimum every first and third quarters, all subsequent dividends will be reviewed and declared at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on many factors, including our financial condition, earnings, cash flows, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, statutory and contractual restrictions applicable to the payment of dividends, and other considerations that the board of directors deems relevant. As a result, we cannot assure you that OMH will continue to pay dividends on its common stock in the future periods, even if liquidity and target leverage objectives are met. See our \u201cDividend Policy\u201d in Part II - Item 5 of this report for further information.\nCertain provisions of an amended and restated stockholders agreement with the Apollo-V\u00e4rde Group, restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could hinder, delay or prevent a change in control of OMH, which could adversely affect the price of OMH's common stock.\nCertain provisions of the Stockholders Agreement, OMH's restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of the board of directors or the Apollo-V\u00e4rde Group. These provisions provide for:\n\u2022a classified board of directors with staggered three-year terms;\n\u2022certain rights to the Apollo-V\u00e4rde Group and certain of its affiliates and permitted transferees with respect to the designation of directors for nomination and election to the board of directors, including the ability to appoint a majority of the members of the board of directors, plus one director, for so long as the Apollo-V\u00e4rde Group and certain of its affiliates and permitted transferees continue to beneficially own, directly or indirectly at least 33% of OMH's issued and outstanding common stock;\n\u2022removal of directors only for cause and only with the affirmative vote of at least 80% of the voting interest of stockholders entitled to vote (provided, however, that for so long as the Apollo-V\u00e4rde Group and certain of its affiliates and permitted transferees beneficially own, directly or indirectly, at least 30% of OMH's issued and\noutstanding common stock, directors may be removed with or without cause with the affirmative vote of a majority of the then issued and outstanding voting interest of stockholders entitled to vote);\n\u2022no ability for stockholders to call special meetings of OMH's stockholders (provided, however, that for so long as the Apollo-V\u00e4rde Group and certain of its affiliates and permitted transferees beneficially own, directly or indirectly, at least 20% of OMH's issued and outstanding common stock, any stockholders that collectively beneficially own at least 20% of OMH's issued and outstanding common stock may call special meetings of our stockholders);\n\u2022advance notice requirements by stockholders with respect to director nominations and actions to be taken at annual meetings;\n\u2022the ability for stockholders to act outside a meeting by written consent only if unanimous, provided, however, that for so long as the Apollo-V\u00e4rde Group and certain of its affiliates and permitted transferees beneficially own, directly or indirectly, at least 20% of OMH's issued and outstanding common stock, OMH's stockholders may act without a meeting by written consent of a majority of OMH's stockholders; and\n\u2022the issuance of blank check preferred stock by the board of directors from time to time in one or more series and to establish the terms, preferences and rights of any such series of preferred stock, all without approval of OMH stockholders. Nothing in OMH's restated certificate of incorporation precludes future issuances without stockholder approval of the authorized but unissued shares of OMH's common stock.\nIn addition, these provisions may make it difficult and expensive for a third party to pursue a tender offer, change in control or takeover attempt that is opposed by the Apollo-V\u00e4rde Group, our management or the board of directors. Public stockholders who might desire to participate in these types of transactions may not have an opportunity to do so, even if the transaction is favorable to stockholders. These anti-takeover provisions could substantially impede the ability of public stockholders to benefit from a change in control or change our management and board of directors and, as a result, may adversely affect the market price of OMH's common stock and the ability of public stockholders to realize any potential change of control premium.\nSee additional information under \u201cBusiness Overview\u201d in Item 1 of this report. The terms of the Amended and Restated Stockholders\u2019 Agreement are described in OMH's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on June 25, 2018, and such Current Report on Form 8-K is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.\nCertain OMH's stockholders have the right to engage or invest in the same or similar businesses as us.\nThe Apollo-V\u00e4rde Group and its affiliates engage in other investments and business activities in addition to their ownership of OMH. Under OMH's restated certificate of incorporation, the Apollo-V\u00e4rde Group and its affiliates have the right, and have no duty to abstain from exercising such right, to engage or invest in the same or similar businesses as us, do business with any of our clients, customers or vendors or employ or otherwise engage any of our officers, directors or employees. If the Apollo-V\u00e4rde Group and its affiliates, or any of their respective officers, directors or employees acquire knowledge of a potential transaction that could be a corporate opportunity, they have no duty, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to offer such corporate opportunity to us, OMH's stockholders or our affiliates.\nIn the event that any of our directors and officers who is also a director, officer or employee of any of the Apollo-V\u00e4rde Group or its affiliates acquires knowledge of a corporate opportunity or is offered a corporate opportunity, provided that this knowledge was not acquired solely in such person\u2019s capacity as our director or officer and such person acts in good faith, then even if the Apollo-V\u00e4rde Group or its affiliates pursues or acquires the corporate opportunity or if the Apollo-V\u00e4rde Group or its affiliates do not present the corporate opportunity to us, such person is deemed to have fully satisfied such person\u2019s fiduciary duties owed to us and is not liable to us.\nLicensing and insurance laws and regulations may delay or impede purchases of OMH's common stock.\nCertain of the states in which we are licensed to originate loans and the state in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled (Texas) have laws and regulations which require regulatory approval for the acquisition of \u201ccontrol\u201d of regulated entities. In addition, the Texas insurance laws and regulations generally provide that no person may acquire control, directly or indirectly, of a domiciled insurer, unless the person has provided the required information to, and the acquisition is subsequently approved or not disapproved by the Department of Insurance (\u201cDOI\u201d). Under state insurance laws or regulations, there exists a presumption of \u201ccontrol\u201d when an acquiring party acquires as little as 10% of the voting securities of a regulated entity or of a company which itself controls (directly or indirectly) a regulated entity (the threshold is 10% under the insurance statute of Texas). Therefore, any person acquiring 10% or more of OMH's common stock may need the prior approval of the Texas insurance and/or licensing regulators, or a determination from such regulators that \u201ccontrol\u201d has not been acquired, which could significantly delay or otherwise impede their ability to complete such purchase.\nRISKS RELATED TO FINANCIAL REPORTING\nFailure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price.\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that we timely report information as specified in the rules and regulations of the SEC. We also maintain a system of internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable reports and prevent fraud.\nWe believe that a control system, no matter how well designed and managed, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. We may not be able to identify all significant deficiencies and/or material weaknesses in our internal controls in the future, and our failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur valuations may include methodologies, models, estimations and assumptions which are subject to differing interpretations and could result in changes to financial assets and liabilities that may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe allowance for finance receivable losses is a critical accounting estimate which requires us to use significant estimates and assumptions to determine the appropriate level of allowance. We estimate the allowance for finance receivable losses primarily on historical loss experience using a cumulative loss model applied to our finance receivable portfolio. Our gross loss expectation is offset by the estimate of future recoveries using historical recovery curves on the active portfolio along with accounts that were previously charged-off. We adjust the amounts determined by the model for the impact of management\u2019s economic forecast, such as the levels of unemployment and personal bankruptcy filings, and the effects of model imprecision which include any changes to underwriting criteria and portfolio seasoning. If we are unable to predict certain of these assumptions accurately, our allowance for finance receivable losses may be inadequate. If actual finance receivable losses are materially greater than our allowance for finance receivable losses, our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity could be adversely affected.\nWe use estimates, assumptions, and judgments when certain financial assets and liabilities are measured and reported at fair value. Fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based on quoted market prices and/or other observable inputs provided by independent third-party sources, when available. During periods of market disruption, including periods of significantly rising or high interest rates, rapidly widening credit spreads or illiquidity, it may be difficult to value certain assets if trading becomes less frequent or market data becomes less observable. In such cases, certain asset valuations may require significant judgment, and may include inputs and assumptions that require greater estimation, including credit quality, liquidity, interest rates and other relevant inputs. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions, or estimates in any of these areas could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nRISKS RELATED TO OMH'S COMMON STOCK\nThe market price and trading volume of OMH's common stock may be volatile, which could result in rapid and substantial losses for OMH's stockholders.\nThe market price of OMH's common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations and may decline significantly in the future. Some of the factors that could negatively affect the share price or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of OMH's common stock include: variations in our quarterly or annual operating results; changes in our earnings estimates (if provided) or differences between our actual financial and operating results and those expected by investors and analysts; the contents of published research reports about us or our industry or the failure of securities analysts to cover OMH's common stock in the future; additions to, or departures of, key management personnel; any increased indebtedness we may incur in the future; announcements by us or others and developments affecting us; actions by institutional stockholders or the Apollo-V\u00e4rde Group; litigation and governmental investigations; changes in market valuations of similar companies; speculation or reports by the press or investment community with respect to us or our industry in general; increases in market interest rates that may lead purchasers of OMH's shares to demand a higher yield; announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, dispositions, strategic relationships, joint ventures or capital commitments; and general market, political and economic conditions, including any such conditions and local conditions in the markets in which our borrowers are located.\nThese broad company, market and industry factors may decrease the market price of OMH's common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. Volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities may result in securities class action litigation. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources.\nFuture offerings of debt or equity securities by us may adversely affect the market price of OMH's common stock.\nIn the future, we may attempt to obtain financing or to further increase our capital resources by issuing additional shares of OMH's common stock or offering debt or other equity securities, including debt securities convertible into equity or shares of preferred stock. Future acquisitions of consumer finance portfolios and/or consumer finance lending or servicing businesses could require substantial additional capital in excess of cash from operations. We would expect to finance the capital required for acquisitions through a combination of additional issuances of equity, corporate indebtedness, asset-backed acquisition financing and/or cash from operations.\nIssuing additional shares of OMH's common stock or other equity securities or securities convertible into equity may dilute the economic and voting rights of OMH's stockholders at the time of such issuance or reduce the market price of OMH's common stock or both. Upon liquidation, holders of debt securities and preferred shares, if issued, and lenders with respect to other borrowings would receive a distribution of our available assets prior to the holders of OMH's common stock. Debt securities convertible into equity could be subject to adjustments in the conversion ratio pursuant to which certain events may increase the number of equity securities issuable upon conversion. Preferred shares, if issued, could have a preference with respect to liquidating distributions or a preference with respect to dividend payments that could limit our ability to pay dividends to the holders of OMH's common stock. Our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, which may adversely affect the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. Thus, holders of OMH's common stock bear the risk that our future offerings may reduce the market price of OMH's common stock and dilute their stockholdings in us.\nThe market price of OMH's common stock could be negatively affected by sales of substantial amounts of OMH's common stock in the public markets.\nAs of December 31, 2020, approximately 40.9% of OMH's outstanding common stock was held by the Apollo-V\u00e4rde Group and, subject to certain restrictions set forth in an amended and restated stockholders agreement, can be resold into the public markets in the future in accordance with the requirements of the Securities Act. A decline in the price of OMH's common stock, whether as a result of sale of stock by the Apollo-V\u00e4rde Group or otherwise, might impede our ability to raise capital through the issuance of additional common stock or other equity securities.\nThe future issuance of additional common stock in connection with our incentive plans, acquisitions or otherwise will dilute all other stockholdings.\nOMH has an aggregate of 1,865,651,598 shares of common stock authorized but unissued as of February 1, 2021. OMH may issue all of these shares of common stock without any action or approval by OMH's stockholders, subject to certain exceptions. OMH also intends to continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities and may issue common stock in connection with these acquisitions. Any common stock issued in connection with our incentive plans, acquisitions, the exercise of outstanding stock options or otherwise would dilute the percentage ownership held by existing OMH's stockholders.\nGENERAL RISKS\nWe are a party to various lawsuits and proceedings and may become a party to various lawsuits and proceedings in the future which, if resolved in a manner adverse to us, could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nIn the normal course of business, from time to time, we have been named, and may be named in the future, as a defendant in various legal actions, including governmental investigations, examinations or other proceedings, arising in connection with our business activities. Certain of the legal actions may include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. Some of these proceedings are pending in jurisdictions that permit damage awards disproportionate to the actual economic damages alleged to have been incurred. A large judgment that is adverse to us could cause our reputation to suffer, encourage additional lawsuits against us and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. For additional information regarding pending legal proceedings and other contingencies, see Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.\nCertain operations rely on external vendors.\nWe rely on third-party vendors to provide products and services necessary to maintain day-to-day operations, including a portion of our information systems, communication, data management and transaction processing. Accordingly, we are exposed to the risk that these vendors might not perform in accordance with the contracted arrangements or service level agreements because of changes in the vendor\u2019s organizational structure, financial condition, support for existing products and services, or strategic focus. Such failure to perform could be disruptive to our operations and have a materially adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. These third parties are also sources of risk associated with operational errors, system interruptions or breaches and unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. If the vendors encounter any of these issues, we could be exposed to disruption of service, damage to reputation and litigation.\nIf we lose the services of any of our key management personnel, our business could suffer.\nOur future success significantly depends on the continued service and performance of our key management personnel. Competition for these employees is intense and we may not be able to attract and retain key personnel. We do not maintain any \u201ckey man\u201d or other related insurance. If we are unable to attract appropriately qualified personnel, we may not be successful in originating loans and servicing our customers, which could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEmployee misconduct could harm us by subjecting us to monetary loss, significant legal liability, regulatory scrutiny and reputational harm.\nOur reputation is critical to developing and maintaining relationships with our existing and potential customers and third parties with whom we do business. There is a risk that our employees could engage in misconduct that adversely affects our business. For example, if an employee were to engage-or be accused of engaging-in illegal or suspicious activities including fraud or theft, we could suffer direct losses from the activity, and in addition we could be subject to regulatory sanctions and suffer serious harm to our reputation, financial condition, customer relationships, and ability to attract future customers or employees. Employee misconduct could prompt regulators to allege or to determine, based upon such misconduct, that we have not established adequate supervisory systems and procedures to inform employees of applicable rules or to detect and deter violations of such rules. It is not always possible to deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent misconduct may not be effective. Misconduct by our employees, or even unsubstantiated allegations of misconduct, could result in a material adverse effect on our reputation and our business.", "PERMNO": 14229, "SIC": 6141, "TIC": "OMF"}
