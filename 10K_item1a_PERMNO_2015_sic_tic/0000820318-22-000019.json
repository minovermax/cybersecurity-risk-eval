RISK FACTORS\nThe following are certain risk factors that could affect our business, results of operations, financial position or cash flows. These risk factors should be considered along with the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, because these factors could cause our actual results or financial condition to differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. The following discussion is not an all-inclusive listing of risks, although we believe these are the material risks that we face. If any of the following occur, our business, results of operations, financial position, or cash flows could be adversely affected. You should carefully consider these factors, as well as the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, when evaluating an investment in our securities.\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Our Industry\nInvestments in future markets of potential significant growth may not result in the expected return.\nWe continue to make investments in programs with the goal of gaining a greater share of end markets using semiconductor lasers and other components, including those used for 3D sensing, power electronics and emerging 5G technology. We cannot guarantee that our investments in capital and capabilities will be sufficient. The potential end markets, as well as our ability to gain market share in such markets, may not materialize on the timeline anticipated or at all. We cannot be sure of the end market price, specification, or yield for products incorporating our technologies. Our technologies could fail to fulfill, partially or completely, our target customers\u2019 specifications. We cannot guarantee the end market customers\u2019 acceptance of our technologies. Further, we may be unable to fulfill the terms of our contracts with our target customers, which could result in penalties of a material nature, including damages, loss of market share, and loss of reputation.\nOur competitive position depends on our ability to develop new products and processes.\nTo meet our strategic objectives, we must develop, manufacture, and market new products and continue to update our existing products and processes to keep pace with market developments to address increasingly sophisticated customer requirements. Our success in developing and selling new and enhanced products and processes depends upon a variety of factors, including strategic product selection, efficient completion of product design and development, timely implementation of manufacturing and assembly processes, effective sales and marketing, and high-quality and successful product performance in the market.\nThe introduction by our competitors of products or processes using new developments that are better or faster than ours could render our products or processes obsolete or unmarketable. We intend to continue to make significant investments in research, development, and engineering to achieve our goals. There can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new products or enhancements to our existing products and processes in a manner which satisfies customer needs or achieves market acceptance. The failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow our business and maintain our competitive position and on our results of operations and/or financial condition.\nOur products may contain defects that are not detected until deployed, which could increase our costs, reduce our revenues, cause us to lose key customers, or expose us to litigation related to our products.\nSome systems that use our products are inherently complex in design and require ongoing maintenance. As a result of the technological complexity of our products, in particular our excimer laser annealing tools used in the flat panel display market, changes in our or our suppliers\u2019 manufacturing processes or the inadvertent use of defective materials by us or our suppliers could result in a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields and product reliability. Our customers may also discover defects in our products after the products have been fully deployed and operated under peak stress conditions. In addition, some of our products are combined with products from other vendors which may contain defects. Should problems occur, it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem. If we are unable to correct defects or other problems, we could experience, among other things, loss of customers, increased costs of product returns and warranty expenses, damage to our brand reputation, failure to attract new customers or achieve market acceptance, diversion of development and engineering resources, or legal action by our customers. The occurrence of any one or more of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nOur competitive position may still require significant investments.\nWe continuously monitor the marketplace for strategic opportunities, and our business strategy includes expanding our product lines and markets through both internal product development and acquisitions. Consequently, we expect to continue to consider strategic acquisition of businesses, products, or technologies complementary to our business. This may require significant investments of management time and financial resources. If market demand is outside our organic capabilities, if a strategic acquisition is required and we cannot identify one or execute on it, and/or if financial investments that we undertake distract management, do not result in the expected return on investment, expose us to unforeseen liabilities, or jeopardize our ability to comply with our credit facility covenants due to any inability to integrate the business, adjust to operating a larger and more complex organization, adapt to additional political and other requirements associated with the acquired business, retain staff, or work with customers, we could suffer a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nWe may be unable to successfully implement our acquisitions strategy or integrate acquired companies and personnel with existing operations.\nWe have acquired several companies, including Finisar Corporation (\u201cFinisar\u201d) in September 2019 and Coherent in July 2022. We expect to expand and diversify our operations with additional acquisitions, but we may be unable to identify or complete prospective acquisitions for many reasons, including increasing competition from other potential acquirers, the effects of consolidation in our industries, and potentially high valuations of acquisition candidates. In addition, applicable antitrust laws and other regulations may limit our ability to acquire targets or force us to divest an acquired business line. If we are unable to identify suitable targets or complete acquisitions, our growth prospects may suffer, and we may not be able to realize sufficient scale and technological advantages to compete effectively in all markets.\nTo the extent that we complete acquisitions, we may be unsuccessful in integrating acquired companies or product lines with existing operations, or the integration may be more difficult or more costly than anticipated. We expect to incur substantial expenses related to the acquisition of Coherent and the related integration of Coherent and its subsidiaries. Some of the risks that may affect our ability to integrate or realize anticipated benefits from acquired companies, businesses, or assets include those associated with:\n\u2022unexpected losses of key employees of the acquired company;\n\u2022conforming the acquired company\u2019s standards, processes, procedures, and controls with our operations, including integrating enterprise resource planning systems and other key business applications;\n\u2022coordinating new product and process development;\n\u2022increasing complexity from combining operations;\n\u2022increasing the scope, geographic diversity, and complexity of our operations;\n\u2022difficulties in consolidating facilities and transferring processes and know-how;\n\u2022diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns; and\n\u2022actions we may take in connection with acquisitions, such as:\n\u25e6using a significant portion of our available cash;\n\u25e6issuing equity securities, which would dilute current shareholders\u2019 percentage ownership;\n\u25e6incurring significant debt;\n\u25e6incurring or assume contingent liabilities, known or unknown, including potential lawsuits, infringement actions, or similar liabilities;\n\u25e6incurring impairment charges related to goodwill or other intangibles; and\n\u25e6facing antitrust or other regulatory inquiries or actions.\nIn addition, the market prices of our outstanding securities could be adversely affected if the effect of any acquisitions on our consolidated financial results is dilutive or is below the market\u2019s or financial analysts\u2019 expectations, or if there are unanticipated changes in the business or financial performance of the acquired or combined company. Any failure to successfully integrate acquired businesses may disrupt our business and adversely impact our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nAlthough we expect that our acquisitions will result in cost savings, synergies, and other benefits, we may not realize those benefits, or be able to retain those benefits even if realized.\nThe success of our acquisitions will depend in large part on our success in integrating the acquired operations, strategies, technologies, and personnel. We may fail to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of an acquisition if the integration process takes longer than expected or is more costly than expected. If we fail to meet the challenges involved in successfully integrating any acquired operations or to otherwise realize any of the anticipated benefits of an acquisition, including any expected cost savings and synergies, our operations could be impaired. In addition, the overall integration of an acquired business can be a time-consuming and expensive process that, without proper planning and effective and timely implementation, could significantly disrupt our business.\nPotential difficulties that we may encounter in the integration process include:\n\u2022the integration of management teams, strategies, technologies and operations, products, and services;\n\u2022the disruption of ongoing businesses and distraction of their respective management teams from ongoing business concerns;\n\u2022the retention of, and possible decrease in business from, existing customers;\n\u2022the creation of uniform standards, controls, procedures, policies, and information systems;\n\u2022the reduction of the costs associated with combined operations;\n\u2022the integration of corporate cultures and maintenance of employee morale;\n\u2022the retention of key employees; and\n\u2022potential unknown liabilities associated with the acquired business.\nThe anticipated cost savings, synergies, and other benefits of any acquisition typically assume a successful integration of the acquired business and are based on projections and other assumptions, which are inherently uncertain. Even if integration is successful, anticipated cost savings, synergies, and other benefits may not be achieved.\nOur future success depends on continued international sales, and our global operations are complex and present multiple challenges to manage.\nWe anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future. The failure to maintain our current volume of international sales could materially affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and/or cash flows.\nWe manufacture products in numerous countries worldwide. Our operations vary by location and are influenced on a location-by-location basis by local customs, languages, and work practices, as well as different local weather conditions, management styles, and education systems. In addition, multiple complex issues may arise concurrently in different countries, potentially hampering our ability to respond in an effective and timely manner. Any inability to respond in an effective and timely manner to issues in our global operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nWe may fail to accurately estimate the size and growth of our markets and our customers\u2019 demands.\nWe make significant decisions based on our estimates of customer requirements. We use our estimates to determine the levels of business we seek and accept, production schedules, personnel needs, and other resource requirements.\nCustomers may require rapid increases in production on short notice. We may not be able to purchase sufficient supplies or allocate sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet such increases in demand. Rapid customer ramp-up and significant increases in demand may strain our resources or negatively affect our margins. Inability to satisfy customer demand in a timely manner may harm our reputation, reduce our other opportunities, damage our relationships with customers, reduce revenue growth, and/or cause us to incur contractual penalties.\nAlternatively, downturns in the industries in which we compete may cause our customers to significantly reduce their demand. With respect to orders we initiate with our suppliers to address anticipated demand from our customers, certain suppliers may have required noncancellable purchase commitments or advance payments from us, and those obligations and commitments could reduce our ability to adjust our inventory or expense levels to reflect declining market demands. Unexpected declines in customer demands can result in excess or obsolete inventory and additional charges. Because certain of our sales, research and development, and internal manufacturing overhead expenses are relatively fixed, a reduction in customer demand likely would decrease our gross margins and operating income.\nWe may encounter increased competition, and we may fail to accurately estimate our competitors\u2019 or our customers\u2019 willingness and capability to backward integrate into our competencies and thereby displace us.\nWe may encounter substantial competition from other companies in the same market, including established companies with significant resources. Some of our competitors may have financial, technical, marketing, or other capabilities that are more extensive than ours. They may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and other competitive pressures. We may not be able to compete successfully against our present or future competitors. Our failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nA significant portion of our business may be subject to cyclical market factors.\nOur business is dependent on the demand for products produced by end-users of industrial lasers, optical communication products, components for semiconductor capital equipment, and components for 3D sensing. Many of these end-users are in industries that have historically experienced a highly cyclical demand for their products. As a result, demand for our products is subject to these cyclical fluctuations. Fluctuations in demand could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nThe long sales cycles for many of our products may cause us to incur significant expenses.\nCustomers often view the purchase of our products as a significant and strategic decision. As a result, customers typically expend significant effort in evaluating, testing and qualifying our products before making a decision to purchase them, resulting in a lengthy design-in sales cycle. While our customers are evaluating our products and before they place an order with us, we may incur substantial sales and marketing and research and development expenses to customize our products to the customers\u2019 needs. We may also expend significant management efforts, increase manufacturing capacity and increase inventory of long lead-time components or materials prior to receiving an order. Even after this evaluation process, a potential customer may not purchase our products. As a result, these long sales cycles may cause us to incur significant expenses without ever receiving revenues to offset such expenses.\nWe have entered into supply agreements that commit us to supply products on specified terms.\nWe have supply agreements with some customers that require us to supply products and allocate sufficient capacity to make these products. We have also agreed to pricing schedules and methodologies that could result in penalties if we fail to meet development, supply, capacity, and quality commitments. Failure to do so may cause us to be unable to generate the amount of revenue or the level of profitability we expect from these arrangements. Our ability to realize a profit under some of these agreements will be subject to the level of customer demand, the cost of maintaining facilities and manufacturing capacity, and supply chain capability. If we fail to fulfill our commitments under these supply agreements, our business, after using all remedies available, financial conditions, and results of operations may suffer a material adverse effect.\nWe depend on highly complex manufacturing processes that require feeder materials, components, and products from limited sources of supply.\nOur operations are dependent upon a supply chain of difficult-to-make or difficult-to-refine products and materials. Some of our product inflow is subject to yield reductions from growth or fabrication losses, and thus the quantities we may receive are not consistently predictable. Customers may also change a specification for a product that our suppliers cannot meet.\nSome of our products, particularly in the OLED display industry, require designs and specifications that are at the cutting-edge of available technologies and change frequently to meet rapidly evolving market demands. By their very nature, the types of components used in such products can be difficult and unpredictable to manufacture and may only be available from a single supplier, which increases the risk that we may not obtain such components in a timely manner. Identifying alternative sources of supply for certain components could be difficult and costly, result in management distraction in assisting our current and future suppliers to meet our and our customers' technical requirements, and cause delays in shipments of our products while we identify, evaluate and test the products of alternative suppliers. Any such delay in shipment would result in a delay or cancellation of our ability to convert such order into revenues. Furthermore, financial or other difficulties faced by these suppliers or significant changes in demand for these components or materials could limit their availability. We continue to consolidate our supply base and move supplier locations. When we transition locations, we may increase our inventory of such products as a \"safety stock\" during the transition, which may cause the amount of inventory reflected on our balance sheet to increase. Additionally, many of our customers rely on sole source suppliers. In the event of a disruption of our customers' supply chain, orders from our customers could decrease or be delayed.\nWe also make products of which we are one of the world\u2019s largest suppliers. We use high-quality, optical-grade ZnSe in the production of many of our IR optical products. We are a leading producer of ZnSe for our internal use and for external sale. The production of ZnSe is a complex process requiring a highly controlled environment. A number of factors, including defective or contaminated materials, could adversely affect our ability to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields of high-quality ZnSe. Lack of adequate availability of high-quality ZnSe could have a material adverse effect upon our business. There can be no assurance that we will not experience manufacturing yield inefficiencies that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nWe produce hydrogen selenide gas, which is used in our production of ZnSe. There are risks inherent in the production and handling of such material. Our lack of proper handling of hydrogen selenide could require us to curtail our production of the gas. Our potential inability to internally produce hydrogen selenide could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nIn addition, we produce and use other high-purity and relatively uncommon materials and compounds to manufacture our products, including, but not limited to, ZnS, GaAs, yttrium aluminum garnet, yttrium lithium fluoride, calcium fluoride, germanium, selenium, telluride, Bi2Te3, and SiC. A significant failure of our internal production processes or our suppliers to deliver sufficient quantities of these necessary materials on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nFurthermore, we have historically relied exclusively on our own production capability to manufacture certain strategic components, crystals, semiconductor lasers, fiber, lasers and laser-based systems. We also manufacture certain large format optics. Because we manufacture, package and test these components, products and systems at our own facilities, and such components, products and systems are not readily available from other sources, any interruption in manufacturing would adversely affect our business.\nDelays in transportation of products and possible shortages of critical raw materials, parts, equipment and other resources may adversely affect our results of operations.\nCurrent challenges in global shipping and other aspects of commercial transportation, such as congestion in ports, a shortage in containers and a general lack of space on ships and trucks, have adversely impacted our operations. Because of this ongoing situation, we face a risk of continued supply chain disruptions. Additionally, our revenues and collections also may be adversely affected by transportation delays that could have a negative impact on the timing of payments that we receive under our sales arrangements. If these issues continue beyond the short term, our overall supply chain and our revenues derived from our sales flow could be adversely impacted.\nWe participate in the microelectronics market, which requires significant research and development expenses to develop and maintain products and a failure to achieve market acceptance for our products could have a significant negative impact on our business and results of operations.\nThe microelectronics market is characterized by rapid technological change, frequent product introductions, the volatility of product supply and demand, changing customer requirements and evolving industry standards. The nature of this market requires significant research and development expenses to participate, with substantial resources invested in advance of material sales of our products to our customers in this market. Additionally, our product offerings may become obsolete given the frequent introduction of alternative technologies. In the event either our customers\u2019 or our products fail to gain market acceptance, or the microelectronics market fails to grow, it would likely have a significant negative effect on our business and results of operations.\nThere are risks associated with our participation in the flat panel display market, including as a result of there being a relatively limited number of end customer manufacturers.\nIn the flat panel display market, it is unclear when the timing will be, or whether it will occur at all, for any further build-out of fabs for the manufacture of OLED screens, and there are a relatively limited number of manufacturers who are the end customers for our annealing products. Given macroeconomic conditions, varying consumer demand and technical process limitations at manufacturers, we may see fluctuations in orders, including periods with no or few orders, and our customers may seek to reschedule or cancel orders.\nAdditionally, challenges in meeting evolving technological requirements for these complex products by us and our suppliers could result in delays in shipments and rescheduled or cancelled orders by our customers. This could negatively impact our backlog, timing of revenues and results of operations.\nIncreases in commodity prices may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are exposed to a variety of market risks, including the effects of increases in commodity prices. Our businesses purchase, produce, and sell high-purity selenium and other raw materials based upon quoted market prices from minor metal exchanges. The negative impact from increases in commodity prices might not be recovered through our product sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings and financial condition.\nA widespread health crisis could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe outbreak of a widespread health crisis, whether global in scope or localized in an area in which we, our customers or our suppliers do business, could have a material adverse effect on our operations and the operations of our suppliers and customers. Potential impacts on our operations include:\n\u2022significant reductions in demand for one or more of our products or a curtailment to one or more of our product lines caused by, among other things, any temporary inability of our customers to purchase and utilize our products in next-stage manufacturing due to shutdown orders or financial hardship;\n\u2022workforce constraints triggered by any applicable shutdown orders or stay-at-home polices;\n\u2022disruptions to our third-party manufacturing and raw materials supply arrangements caused by constraints over our suppliers\u2019 workforce capacity, financial, or operational difficulties;\n\u2022disruption in our own ability to produce and ship products, including components we use in the production of other products;\n\u2022heightened risk and uncertainty regarding the loss or disruption of essential third-party service providers, including transportation services, contract manufacturing, marketing, and distribution services;\n\u2022requirements to comply with governmental and regulatory responses such as quarantines, import/export restrictions, price controls, or other governmental or regulatory actions, including closures or other restrictions that limit or close our operating and manufacturing facilities, restrict our workforce\u2019s ability to travel or perform necessary business functions, or otherwise impact our suppliers or customers, which could adversely impact our operating results; and\n\u2022increased operating expenses and potentially reduced efficiency of operations.\nIn the early stages of the outbreak of the global novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in 2020, we closely monitored the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on all aspects of our business, including the impact to our suppliers, customers, and employees, as well as the impact to the countries and markets in which we operate. We began focusing intensely on mitigating the adverse impacts of COVID-19 on our foreign and domestic operations, starting by protecting our employees, suppliers, and customers. We have modified our business practices for the continued health and safety of our employees - including, among other things, implementing a remote work policy to the fullest extent possible, a limited travel policy, the distribution of and mandatory use of personal protective equipment, reorganizing and adjusting the timing of manufacturing personnel shifts, temperature monitoring for entering our facilities, and a social distancing policy - and we may take further actions, or be required to take further actions, that are in the best interests of our employees.\nOur suppliers, distributors and customers have also implemented similar measures, which has resulted in, and we expect it will continue to result in, disruptions or delays and higher costs. The implementation of health and safety practices by us or our suppliers, distributors or customers could impact customer demand, supplier deliveries, our productivity, and costs, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWhile we believe that we have been successful in identifying, managing, and mitigating the economic disruption impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on us, we cannot provide any assurance that we similarly will be able to mitigate the impacts of any future widespread health crises, including as a result of any variants of COVID-19. Factors beyond our current knowledge or control, including the duration and severity of any outbreak, as well as any resulting governmental and regulatory actions, could cause any such crisis to have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nGlobal economic downturns may adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nCurrent and future conditions in the global economy have an inherent degree of uncertainty. As a result, it is difficult to estimate the level of growth or contraction of the global economy as a whole. It is even more difficult to estimate growth or contraction in various parts, sectors, and regions of the economy, including the industrial, aerospace and defense, optical communications, telecommunications, semiconductor, consumer, microelectronics, precision manufacturing, instrumentation, and life science markets in which we participate. All aspects of our forecasts depend on estimates of growth or contraction in the markets we serve. Thus, prevailing global economic uncertainties render estimates of future income and expenditures very difficult to make.\nGlobal economic downturns may affect industries in which our customers operate. These changes could include decreases in the rate of consumption or use of our customers\u2019 products. Such conditions could have a material adverse effect on demand for our customers\u2019 products and, in turn, on demand for our products.\nAdverse changes may occur in the future as a result of declining or flat global or regional economic conditions, fluctuations in currency and commodity prices, wavering confidence, capital expenditure reductions, unemployment, decline in stock markets, contraction of credit availability, or other factors affecting economic conditions. For example, factors that may affect our operating results include disruption in the credit and financial markets in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere, adverse effects of slowdowns in the U.S., European, Chinese or other Asian economies, reductions or limited growth in consumer spending or consumer credit, global trade tariffs, and other adverse economic conditions that may be specific to the Internet, e-commerce, and payments industries.\nThese changes may negatively affect sales of products and increase exposure to losses from bad debt and commodity prices, the cost and availability of financing, and costs associated with manufacturing and distributing products. Any economic downturn could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nForeign currency risk may negatively affect our revenues, cost of sales, and operating margins, and could result in foreign exchange losses.\nWe conduct our business and incur costs in the local currency of most countries in which we operate. We incur currency transaction risk whenever one of our operating subsidiaries enters into either a purchase or a sales transaction using a different currency from the currency in which it operates, or holds assets or liabilities in a currency different from its functional currency. Changes in exchange rates can also affect our results of operations when the value of sales and expenses of foreign subsidiaries are translated to U.S. dollars. We cannot accurately predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations. Further, given the volatility of exchange rates, we may not be able to effectively manage our currency risks, and any volatility in currency exchange rates may increase the price of our products in local currency to our foreign customers or\nincrease the manufacturing cost of our products, either of which may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows, and profitability.\nWe are subject to complex and rapidly changing import and export regulations which could limit our sales and decrease our profitability and we may be subject to legal and regulatory consequences if we do not comply with applicable export control laws and regulations\nObtaining export licenses can be difficult, time-consuming and require interpretation of complex regulations. Failure to obtain export licenses for these shipments could significantly reduce our revenue and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, relationships with our customers and results of operations. Additionally, failure to comply with the various regulatory requirements could subject us to significant fines, suspension of export privileges or disbarment.\nAdditionally, we are subject to the passage of and changes in the interpretation of regulation by U.S. government entities at the federal, state, and local levels and by non-U.S. agencies, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022We are required to comply with import laws and export control and economic sanctions laws, which may affect our ability to enter into or complete transactions with certain customers, business partners, and other persons. In certain circumstances, export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products, services, and technologies. We may be required to obtain an export license before exporting a controlled item, and granting of a required license cannot be assured. Compliance with the import laws that apply to our businesses may restrict our access to, and may increase the cost of obtaining, certain products and could interrupt our supply of imported inventory.\n\u2022Exported technologies necessary to develop and manufacture certain products are subject to U.S. export control laws and similar laws of other jurisdictions. We may be subject to adverse regulatory consequences, including government oversight of facilities and export transactions, monetary penalties, and other sanctions for violations of these laws. In certain instances, these regulations may prohibit us from developing or manufacturing certain of our products for specific applications outside the United States. Failure to comply with any of these laws and regulations could result in civil and criminal, monetary, and nonmonetary penalties; disruptions to our business; limitations on our ability to import and export products and services; and damage to our reputation.\nChanges in trade policies, such as increased import duties, could increase the costs of goods imported into the United States or China.\nIn March 2018, President Trump announced new steel and aluminum tariffs. Then, in July 2018, the United States imposed increased tariffs on products of Chinese origin, and China responded by increasing tariffs on U.S.-origin goods. On the export side, denial orders and placing companies on the U.S. entity list could decrease our access to customers and markets and materially impact our revenues in the aggregate. In April 2018, for example, the U.S. Department of Commerce issued a denial order against two companies in the telecommunications market. In 2019 and 2020, the U.S. Department of Commerce placed a number of entities, including Huawei, on the U.S. Entity List. If we cannot obtain relief from, or take other action to mitigate the impact of, these additional duties and restrictions and duties, our business and profits may be materially and adversely affected. Further changes in the trade policy of the United States or of other countries in which we do cross-border business, or additional sanctions, could result in retaliatory actions by other countries that could materially and negatively impact the volume of economic activity in the United States or globally, which, in turn, may decrease our access to customers and markets, reduce our revenues, and increase our operating costs.\nOur association with customers that are or become subject to U.S. regulatory scrutiny or export restrictions could negatively impact our business and create instability in our operations. Governmental actions such as these could subject us to actual or perceived reputational harm among current or prospective investors, suppliers or customers, customers of our customers, other parties doing business with us, or the general public. Any such reputational harm could result in the loss of investors, suppliers, or customers, which could harm our business, financial condition, operating results, or prospects.\nExports of certain of our products are subject to export controls imposed by the U.S. government and administered by the U.S. Departments of State and Commerce. In certain instances, these regulations may require pre-shipment authorization from the administering department. For products subject to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), administered by the Department of Commerce\u2019s Bureau of Industry and Security, the requirement for a license is dependent on the type and end use of the product, the final destination, the identity of the end user, and whether a license exception might apply. Virtually all exports of products subject to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), administered by the Department of State\u2019s Directorate of Defense Trade Controls, require a license. Certain of our products are subject to EAR controls.\nAdditionally, certain other products that we sell, including certain products developed with government funding, are subject to ITAR. Products developed and manufactured in our foreign locations are subject to export controls of the applicable foreign nation. Given the current global political climate, obtaining export licenses can be difficult and time-consuming. Failure to obtain export licenses for these shipments, or having one or more of our customers be restricted from receiving exports from us, could significantly reduce our revenue and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations. Compliance with regulations of the United States and other governments also subjects us to additional fees and costs. The absence of comparable restrictions on competitors in other countries may adversely affect our competitive position.\nOur current credit agreement and any other credit or similar agreements into which we may enter in the future may restrict our operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions regarding our business.\nOur credit agreement, dated as of July 1, 2022, by and among us, the lenders and other parties thereto, and JP Morgan Chase Bank, NA, as administrative agent and collateral agent (the \u201cNew Credit Agreement\u201d) contains a number of restrictive covenants that may impose operating and financial restrictions on us and limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interest, including restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness, grant liens, undergo certain fundamental changes, fund non-US operations, dispose of assets, make certain investments, enter into certain transactions with affiliates, and make certain restricted payments, in each case subject to limitations and exceptions set forth in the New Credit Agreement.\nThe New Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default that include, among other things, certain payment defaults, covenant defaults, cross-defaults to other indebtedness, change of control defaults, judgment defaults, and bankruptcy and insolvency defaults. Such events of default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, and financial results. Furthermore, if we are unable to repay the amounts due and payable under the New Credit Agreement, those lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness, which could force us into bankruptcy or liquidation. In the event that our lenders accelerated the repayment of the borrowings, we may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness. Any acceleration of amounts due under the New Credit Agreement would likely have a material adverse effect on us. As a result of these restrictions, we may be limited in how we conduct business, unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or business downturns, or unable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities.\nIn addition, we may enter into other credit agreements or other debt arrangements from time to time which contain similar or more extensive restrictive covenants and events of default, in which case we may face similar or additional limitations as a result of the terms of those credit agreements or other debt arrangements.\nAny inability to access financial markets from time to time to raise required capital, finance our working capital requirements or our acquisition strategies, or otherwise support our liquidity needs could negatively impact our ability to finance our operations, meet certain obligations, or implement our growth strategy.\nWe from time to time borrow under our existing credit facility or use proceeds from sales of our securities to fund portions of our operations, including working capital investments and financing of our acquisition strategies. In the past, market disruptions experienced in the United States and abroad have materially impacted liquidity in the credit and debt markets, making financing terms for borrowers less attractive and, in certain cases, have resulted in the unavailability of certain types of financing. Uncertainty in the financial markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional financing or to refinance our existing debt arrangements on favorable terms or at all, which could negatively affect our ability to fund current and future expansion as well as future acquisitions and development. These disruptions may include turmoil in the financial services industry, volatility in the markets where our outstanding securities trade, and changes in general economic conditions in the areas where we do business. If we are unable to access funds at competitive rates, or if our short-term or long-term borrowing costs increase, our ability to finance our operations, meet our short-term obligations, and implement our operating strategies could be adversely affected.\nIn the future, we may be required to raise additional capital through public or private financing or other arrangements. Such financing may not be available on acceptable terms or at all, and our failure to raise capital when needed could harm our business and prospects. Additional equity financing may be dilutive to the holders of our outstanding capital stock, and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants that may limit our ability to undertake certain activities that we otherwise would find to be desirable. Further, debt service obligations associated with any debt financing could reduce our profitability. If we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms, we may not be able to grow our business or respond to competitive pressures.\nThere are limitations on the protection of our intellectual property, and we may from time to time be involved in costly intellectual property litigation or indemnification.\nWe rely on a combination of trade secret, patent, copyright, and trademark laws, combined with employee confidentiality, noncompetition, and nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. There can be no assurance that the steps we take will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology or intellectual property. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future.\nAsserting our intellectual property rights or defending against third-party claims could involve substantial expense. In the event that a third party were successful in a claim that one of our processes infringed its proprietary rights, we could be required to pay substantial damages or royalties, or spend substantial amounts in order to obtain a license or modify processes so that they\nno longer infringe such proprietary rights. Any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nThe design, processes, and specialized equipment utilized in our engineered materials, advanced components, and subsystems are innovative, complex, and difficult to duplicate. However, there can be no assurance that others will not develop or patent similar technology, or that all aspects of our proprietary technology will be protected. Others have obtained patents covering a variety of materials, devices, equipment, configurations, and processes, and others could obtain patents covering technology similar to ours. We may be required to obtain licenses under such patents, and there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain such licenses, if required, on commercially reasonable terms, or that claims regarding rights to technology will not be asserted that may adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, our research and development contracts with agencies of the U.S. government present a risk that project-specific technology could be disclosed to competitors as contract reporting requirements are fulfilled. We also enter into development projects from time to time that might result in intellectual property developed during a project that is assigned to the other party without us retaining rights to that intellectual property or is jointly owned with the other party.\nOur global operations are subject to complex legal and regulatory requirements.\nWe manufacture products in numerous countries worldwide. Operations inside and outside of the United States are subject to many legal and regulatory requirements, some of which are not aligned with others. These include tariffs, quotas, taxes and other market barriers, restrictions on the export or import of technology, potentially limited intellectual property protection, import and export requirements and restrictions, anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, foreign investment rules and regulations, data privacy requirements, competition laws, employment and labor laws, pensions and social insurance, and environmental health and safety laws and regulations.\nCompliance with these laws and regulations can be onerous and expensive, and requirements differ among jurisdictions. New laws, changes in existing laws, and abrogation of local regulations by national laws may result in significant uncertainties in how they will be interpreted and enforced. Failure to comply with any of these foreign laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nWe may face particular data privacy and security and data protection risks due to laws and regulations regulating the protection or security of personal and other sensitive data.\nWe may face particular data privacy and security and data protection risks due to laws and regulations regulating the protection or security of personal and other sensitive data, including in particular several laws and regulations that have recently been enacted or adopted or are likely to be enacted or adopted in the future. For instance, effective May 25, 2018, the European General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) imposed additional obligations and risk upon our business and increased substantially the penalties to which we could be subject in the event of any non-compliance. GDPR requires companies to satisfy requirements regarding the handling of personal data (generally, of EU residents), including its use, protection and the rights of affected persons regarding their data. Failure to comply with GDPR requirements could result in fines of up to 20 million Euro or 4% of global annual revenues, whichever is higher. We have taken extensive measures to ensure compliance with GDPR and to minimize the risk of incurring any penalties and we continue to adapt to the developing interpretation and enforcement of GDPR as well as emerging best practice standards. For example, we have introduced an international Data Protection Organization, a European Data Protection Policy, a system for Data Protection Management and Documentation and implemented an international Intra Group Data Transfer Agreement including the EU Standard Contractual Clauses. In addition, several other jurisdictions around the world have recently enacted privacy laws or regulations similar to GDPR. For instance, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which became effective January 1, 2020 and which gives consumers many of the same rights as those available under GDPR. Several laws similar to the CCPA have been proposed in the United States at both the federal and state level. Like GDPR, other similar laws and regulations, as well as any associated inquiries or investigations or any other government actions, may be costly to comply with, result in negative publicity, increase our operating costs, require significant management time and attention, and subject us to remedies that may harm our business.\nThere also have also been recent significant developments concerning privacy and data security in China, where we have significant operations. For example, the Data Security Law of the People\u2019s Republic of China (the \u201cData Security Law\u201d) took effect in September 2021. The Data Security Law imposes data security and privacy obligations on entities and individuals carrying out data processing activities and also introduces a data classification and hierarchical protection system based on the importance of data in economic and social development and the degree of harm it may cause to national security, public interests, or legitimate rights and interests of individuals or organizations if such data are tampered with, destroyed, leaked, illegally acquired, or illegally used. The appropriate level of protection measures is required to be taken for each respective category of data. Further, the Personal Information Protection Law (the \u201cPIPL\u201d) took effect in China in November 2021. The PIPL raises the protection requirements for processing personal information. Because many specific requirements of the PIPL remain to be clarified, the ultimate impact of the PIPL currently is unknown. Fines for PIPL violations range from $7.7M to up\nto 5% of the infringing company\u2019s previous year\u2019s revenues. We may be required to make adjustments to our business practices to comply with the personal information protection laws and regulations in China.\nData breach incidents and breakdowns of information and communication technologies could disrupt our operations and impact our financial results.\nIn the course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property (both our own and that of our customers), as well as proprietary business information. We could be subject to service outages or breaches of security systems which may result in disruption, unauthorized access, misappropriation, or corruption of this information. Security breaches of our network or data, including physical or electronic break-ins, vendor service outages, computer viruses, attacks by hackers or similar breaches can create system disruptions, shutdowns, and unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. If we are unable to prevent or contain such security or privacy breaches, our operations could be disrupted or we could suffer legal claims, loss of reputation, financial loss, property damage, or regulatory penalties.\nWe use and generate potentially hazardous substances that are subject to stringent environmental regulations.\nHazardous substances used or generated in some of our research and manufacturing facilities are subject to stringent environmental regulation. We believe that our handling of such substances is in material compliance with applicable environmental, safety, and health regulations at each operating location. We invest substantially in proper personal protective equipment and process controls, including monitoring and specialized training, to minimize risks to employees, surrounding communities, and the environment that could result from the presence and handling of such hazardous substances. When exposure problems or potential exposure problems have been uncovered, corrective actions have been implemented, and re-occurrence has been minimal or nonexistent.\nWe have in place emergency response plans with respect to our generation and use of the hazardous gases, which include hydrogen selenide, hydrogen sulfide, arsine, phosphine, and silane. Special attention has been given to all procedures pertaining to these gaseous materials to minimize the chance of accidental release into the atmosphere and to provide for an integrated system for monitoring and mitigating risk.\nWith respect to the manufacturing, use, storage, and disposal of the low-level radioactive material thorium fluoride, our facilities and procedures have been inspected and licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Thorium-bearing by-products are collected and shipped as solid waste to a government-approved low-level radioactive waste disposal site in Clive, Utah.\nThe generation, use, collection, storage, and disposal of all other hazardous by-products, such as suspended solids containing heavy metals or airborne particulates, are believed by us to be in material compliance with regulations. We believe that we have obtained all of the permits and licenses required for operation of our business.\nFrom time to time new regulations are enacted, and it is difficult to anticipate how such regulations will be implemented and enforced. We continue to evaluate the necessary steps for compliance with regulations as they are enacted. The implementation of such regulations may require us to incur additional costs and expend internal resources.\nAlthough we do not know of any material environmental, safety, or health problems in our properties, processes, or products, there can be no assurance that problems will not develop in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nWe have a substantial amount of debt, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations and prevent us from fulfilling our debt-related obligations.\nAs of June 30, 2022, we had approximately $2.3 billion of outstanding indebtedness on a consolidated basis. Immediately following the closing of the Coherent acquisition on July 1, 2022, we had $5.0 billion of outstanding indebtedness, including under (i) our $850 million senior secured term loan A facility (the \u201cTerm A Facility\u201d), our $2.8 billion senior secured term loan B facility (the \u201cTerm Loan B Facility\u201d, and together with the Term A Facility, the \u201cSenior Credit Facilities\u201d) and (ii) our $990 million 5.000% senior notes due 2029 (the \u201c2029 Notes\u201d). Additionally we have $350 million of undrawn capacity under our senior secured revolving credit facility (the \u201cRevolving Credit Facility. We may also incur additional indebtedness in the future by entering into new financing arrangements. Our indebtedness could have important consequences for us, including:\n\u2022making it difficult for us to satisfy all of our obligations with respect to our debt, or to our trade or other creditors;\n\u2022increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions;\n\u2022limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions, particularly when the availability of financing in the capital markets is limited;\n\u2022requiring us to pay higher interest rates upon refinancing or on our variable-rate indebtedness if interest rates rise;\n\u2022requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations and the proceeds of any capital markets offerings or loan borrowings for the payment of interest on our debt and reducing our ability to use our cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and general corporate requirements;\n\u2022limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate; and\n\u2022placing us at a competitive disadvantage to less leveraged competitors.\nWe may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations, together with any future borrowings, to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. We may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness, on or before its maturity. We may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all. In addition, we may incur additional indebtedness in order to finance our operations, fund acquisitions, or repay existing indebtedness. If we cannot service our indebtedness, we may have to take actions such as selling assets, pursuing sales of additional debt or equity securities, or reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments, or alliances. Any such actions, if necessary, may not be able to be effected on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or on terms that would be advantageous to our stockholders, or on terms that would not require us to breach the terms and conditions of our existing or future debt agreements.\nCertain of our financial arrangements, including our Senior Credit Facilities, are made at variable rates that use interbank offered rates, or IBORs, including the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR (or metrics derived from or related to LIBOR), as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate. IBORs are or have been reformed, may cease to be available or may be declared to be no longer representative of the underlying market and economic realities. In such a case IBORs and specifically LIBOR may need to be replaced with a replacement rate. In March 2021, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to cease or otherwise declare as no longer representative certain LIBOR settings on December 31, 2021 and the remainder of the U.S. dollar LIBOR settings on June 30, 2023. The New Credit Agreement contains provisions addressing the end of the use of LIBOR as a benchmark rate of interest and a mechanism for determining an alternative benchmark rate of interest. At this time, we cannot predict how markets will respond to reform or the proposed alternative rates or the effect of any changes to IBORs or the discontinuation or non-representativeness of LIBOR. New methods of calculating IBORs that may be established or the establishment of alternative reference rates could have an adverse impact on the market value for or value of IBOR-linked securities, loans and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due to us. Changes in market interest rates may influence our financing costs, returns on financial investments and the valuation of derivative contracts and could reduce our earnings and cash flows. There is no guarantee that a transition from IBORs and specifically LIBOR to an alternative will not result in financial market disruptions, significant increases in benchmark rates, or borrowing costs to borrowers, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe agreements that govern our senior credit facilities and our 2029 Notes contain various covenants that impose restrictions on our business, which may affect our ability to operate our businesses.\nThe New Credit Agreement and the Indenture, dated as of December 10, 2021 (the \u201cIndenture), which provides for the 2029 Notes, contain various affirmative and negative covenants that will, subject to certain significant exceptions, restrict our ability to, among other things, have liens on our property, incur additional indebtedness, enter into sale and lease-back transactions, make loans, advances or other investments, make non-ordinary course asset sales, declare or pay dividends or make other distributions with respect to equity interests, and/or merge or consolidate with any other person or sell or convey certain of our assets to any one person, among other things.\nIn addition, the Term Loan A Facility and Revolving Credit Facility require that the Company maintain (i) a maximum total net leverage ratio, as defined in the New Credit Agreement, initially of 5.25 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, commencing with the end of the first full fiscal quarter after the Closing Date, stepping down to 4.00 to 1.00 at December 31, 2023 and thereafter and (ii) an interest coverage ratio, as defined in the New Credit Agreement, of at least 2.50 to 1.00.\nOur ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control. Failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could accelerate our repayment obligations under the New Credit Agreement or the Indenture, as applicable. If such indebtedness is accelerated, there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient financial resources or that we will be able to arrange financing to repay our borrowings at such time.\nUnfavorable changes in tax rates, tax liabilities, or tax accounting rules could negatively affect future results.\nAs a global company, we are subject to taxation in the United States and various other countries and jurisdictions. As such, we must exercise a level of judgment in determining our worldwide tax liabilities. Our future tax rates could be affected by changes in the composition of earnings in countries with differing tax rates or changes in tax laws as well as changes in our current or future global corporate structure. Changes in tax laws or tax rulings may have a significantly adverse impact on our effective tax rate, including the newly-enacted \u201cInflation Reduction Act of 2022\u201d and the two-pillar solution for a global minimum level of taxation by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (\u201cOECD\u201d). We are also impacted by the establishment or release of valuation allowances against deferred tax assets, changes in generally accepted accounting principles and continued eligibility for tax holiday benefits.\nThe enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d) in December 2017 significantly affected U.S. tax law by changing how the United States imposes tax on multinational corporations. The U.S. Department of Treasury has broad authority under the Tax Act to issue regulations and interpretive guidance. We have applied available guidance to estimate our tax obligations, but new guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury Department may cause us to make adjustments to our tax estimates in future periods.\nIn addition, we are subject to regular examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. This includes challenges to our intercompany transfer pricing arrangements and charges and the appropriate level of profitability for our entities. We regularly assess the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations and Competent Authority processes to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, there can be no assurance that any final determination will not be materially different from the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provision and accruals, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operation, or financial condition.\nNatural disasters or other global or regional catastrophic events could disrupt our operations, give rise to substantial environmental hazards, and adversely affect our results.\nWe may be exposed to business interruptions due to extreme weather caused by climate change and deforestation, force majeure catastrophes, natural disaster, pandemic, terrorism, or acts of war that are beyond our control. Disruptions to our facilities or systems, or to those of our key suppliers, could also interrupt operational processes and adversely impact our ability to manufacture our products and provide services and support to our customers. As a result, our business, results of operations, or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nA substantial portion of our research and development activities, manufacturing, and other critical business operations are located near major earthquake faults, for example in Santa Clara, California, an area with a history of seismic events. Any such loss or detrimental impact to any of our operations, logistics or facilities could disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenues and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility. While we have obtained insurance to cover most potential losses, after reviewing the costs and limitations associated with earthquake insurance, we have decided not to procure such insurance. We believe that this decision is consistent with decisions reached by numerous other companies located nearby. We cannot assure you that our existing insurance coverage will be adequate against all other possible losses.\nRussia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and the resulting conflict has had a negative impact on our business, may continue to negatively impact our business and may have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nIn February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine, resulting in the United States, Canada, the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) and other countries imposing economic sanctions on Russia, some of which have been expanded to include Belarus. The military conflict and the resulting sanctions have caused and are expected to continue to cause significant disruptions in logistics, availability of components and supplies used in the manufacture and services of our products and global markets. The largest source of certain gases which are utilized in the application and servicing of some of our laser products has historically been located in Ukraine. We have accelerated purchases of these gases from other limited sources outside of the conflict zone and, to date, we have avoided any material disruption to our business. Similarly, our end customers for these products are largely located in geographies which have access to these gases from local suppliers.\nA material reduction in our access to critical supplies, the disruption in the ability to source components and supplies used in the manufacture, service or use of our products and the availability of shipping and the increased costs therefor would likely negatively impact the results of our operations. Additionally, the consequences of the foregoing or other limitation on the availability of fuels to provide electricity in the EU to businesses at the same current levels could have a material adverse effect on our business, particularly with regard to our ability to manufacture and ship products at our manufacturing locations in Germany, and is likely to result in higher operating costs.\nOur success requires us to attract, retain, and develop key personnel and maintain good relations with our employees.\nWe are highly dependent upon the experience and continuing services of certain scientists, engineers, production, and management personnel. Competition for the services of these personnel is intense. There can be no assurance that we will be able to retain or attract the personnel necessary for our success. The loss of the services of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nWe contract with a number of large end-user service providers and product companies that have considerable bargaining power, which may require us to agree to terms and conditions that could have an adverse effect on our business or ability to recognize revenues.\nLarge end-user service providers and product companies comprise a significant portion of our customer base. These customers generally have greater purchasing power than smaller entities and, accordingly, often request and receive more favorable terms from suppliers, including us. As we seek to expand our sales to existing customers and acquire new customers, we may be\nrequired to agree to terms and conditions that are favorable to our customers and that may affect the timing of our ability to recognize revenue, increase our costs, and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Furthermore, large customers have increased buying power and ability to require onerous terms in our contracts with them, including pricing, warranties, and indemnification terms. If we are unable to satisfy the terms of these contracts, it could result in liabilities of a material nature, including litigation, damages, additional costs, loss of market share, and loss of reputation. Additionally, the terms these large customers require, such as most-favored customer or exclusivity provisions, may impact our ability to do business with other customers and generate revenues from such customers.\nWe may be adversely affected by climate change regulations.\nIn many of the countries in which we operate, government bodies are increasingly enacting legislation and regulations in response to potential impacts of climate change. These laws and regulations may be mandatory. They have the potential to impact our operations directly or indirectly as a result of required compliance by our customers or our supply chain. Inconsistency of regulations may also affect the costs of compliance with such laws and regulations. Assessments of the potential impact of future climate change legislation, regulation, and international treaties and accords are uncertain, given the wide scope of potential regulatory change in countries in which we operate.\nWe may incur increased capital expenditures resulting from required compliance with revised or new legislation or regulations, added costs to purchase raw materials, lower profits from sales of our products, allowances or credits under a \u201ccap and trade\u201d system, increased insurance premiums and deductibles as new actuarial tables are developed to reshape coverage, changes in competitive position relative to industry peers, changes to profit or loss arising from increased or decreased demand for goods produced by us, or changes in costs of goods sold.\nSome of our business units depend from time to time on large purchases from a few significant customers, and any loss, cancellation, reduction, or delay in purchases by these customers could harm the longevity of the business.\nA small number of customers have consistently accounted for a significant portion of our revenues, although none individually represent greater than 10% of total revenues. Our success will depend on our continued ability to develop and manage relationships with our major customers. Although we are attempting to expand our customer base, we expect that significant customer concentration will continue for the foreseeable future. We may not be able to offset any decline in revenues from our existing major customers with revenues from new customers, and our quarterly results may be volatile because we are dependent on large orders from these customers that may be reduced, delayed, or cancelled. The markets in which we have historically sold our optical subsystems and components products are dominated by a relatively small number of systems manufacturers, thereby limiting the number of our potential customers.\nOur dependence on large orders from a relatively small number of customers makes our relationship with each customer critically important to our business. We cannot ensure that we will be able to retain our major customers, attract additional customers, or that our customers will be successful in selling their products that incorporate our products. In addition, governmental trade action or economic sanctions may limit or preclude our ability to do business with certain customers. We have in the past experienced delays and reductions in orders from some of our major customers. In addition, our customers have in the past sought price concessions from us, and we expect that they will continue to do so in the future. Expense reduction measures that we have implemented over the past several years, and additional action we are taking to reduce costs, may adversely affect our ability to introduce new and improved products, which may, in turn, adversely affect our relationships with some of our key customers. Further, some of our customers may in the future shift their purchases of products from us to our competitors or to joint ventures between these customers and our competitors, or may in certain circumstances produce competitive products themselves. The loss of one or more of our major customers, any reduction or delay in sales to these customers, our inability to successfully develop relationships with additional customers, or future price concessions that we may make could significantly harm our business.\nOur operations may be adversely affected if we are unable to manufacture certain products in our manufacturing facilities.\nWe manufacture some of the components that we incorporate into our subsystem products; in other cases, we provide components to contract manufacturers to produce finished goods. For some of the components and finished goods, we are the sole manufacturer. Our manufacturing processes are highly complex, and issues are often difficult to detect and correct. From time to time we have experienced problems achieving acceptable yields in our manufacturing facilities, resulting in delays in the availability of our products. In addition, if we experience problems with our manufacturing facilities, it would be costly and require a long period of time to move the manufacture of these components and finished good products to a different facility or contract manufacturer, which could result in interruptions in supply and would likely materially impact our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, for a variety of reasons, including changes in circumstances at our contract manufacturers or our own business strategies, we may voluntarily, or be required to, transfer the manufacturing of certain products to other manufacturing sites.\nChanges in manufacturing processes are often required due to changes in product specifications, changing customer needs, and the introduction of new products. These changes may reduce manufacturing yields at our contract manufacturers and at our own manufacturing facilities, resulting in reduced margins on those products. Also, our ability to control the quality of products produced by contract manufacturers may be limited and quality issues may not be resolved in a timely manner, which could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations. In addition, many of our products are sourced from suppliers based outside of the United States, primarily in Asia. Uncertainty with respect to tax and trade policies, tariffs, and government regulations affecting trade between the United States and other countries has recently increased. Major developments in tax policy or trade relations, such as the imposition of tariffs on imported products, could increase our product and product-related costs or require us to seek alternative suppliers, either of which could result in decreased sales or increased product and product-related costs.\nFailure to accurately forecast our revenues could result in additional charges for obsolete or excess inventories or noncancellable purchase commitments.\nWe base many of our operating decisions, and enter into purchase commitments, on the basis of anticipated revenue trends that are highly unpredictable. Some of our purchase commitments are not cancellable, and in some cases we are required to recognize a charge representing an amount of material or capital equipment purchased or ordered that exceeds our actual requirements. Should revenues in future periods fall substantially below our expectations, or should we fail to accurately forecast changes in demand mix, we could be required to record substantial charges for obsolete or excess inventories or noncancellable purchase commitments.\nOur markets are unpredictable and characterized by rapid technological changes and evolving standards demanding a significant investment in research and development, and, if we fail to address changing market conditions, our business and operating results will be harmed.\nThe photonics industry is characterized by extensive research and development, rapid technological change, frequent new product introductions, changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards. Because this industry is subject to rapid change, it is difficult to predict its potential size or future growth rate. Our success in generating net sales in this industry will depend on, among other things:\n\u2022maintaining and enhancing our relationships with our customers;\n\u2022the education of potential end-user customers about the benefits of lasers and laser systems; and\n\u2022our ability to accurately predict and develop our products to meet industry standards.\nWe cannot assure you that our expenditures for research and development will result in the introduction of new products or, if such products are introduced, that those products will achieve sufficient market acceptance or to generate sales to offset the costs of development. Our failure to address rapid technological changes in our markets could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIf our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.\nUnder accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we review our intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be considered in determining whether a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or other intangible assets may not be recoverable include declines in our stock price and market capitalization or future cash flows projections. A decline in our stock price, or any other adverse change in market conditions, particularly if such change has the effect of changing one of the critical assumptions or estimates we used to calculate the estimated fair value of our reporting units, could result in a change to the estimation of fair value that could result in an impairment charge. Any such material charges, whether related to goodwill or purchased intangible assets, may have a material negative impact on our financial and operating results.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (\u201cthe Sarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d), and Nasdaq listing requirements. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. In order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, we have expended, and anticipate that we will continue to expend, significant resources, including accounting-related costs and significant management oversight.\nAny failure to develop or maintain effective controls, or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement, could delay the reporting of our financial results or cause us to be subject to investigations, enforcement actions by regulatory agencies, stockholder lawsuits, or other adverse actions requiring us to incur defense costs or pay fines, settlements, or\njudgments. Any such failures or difficulties could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock. In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market.\nRisks Relating to Our Capital Stock\nThe trading prices for our securities have been volatile in the past and may be volatile in the future.\nThe trading prices for our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market Composite varied between a high of $75.23 per share and a low of $50.14 per share in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. Likewise, the trading prices of our Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock varied between a high of $308.50 per share and a low of $215.02 per share in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. The market prices of our securities could fluctuate significantly for many reasons, including the following:\n\u2022future announcements concerning us or our competitors;\n\u2022the overall performance of equity markets;\n\u2022the trading volume of our securities;\n\u2022additions or changes to our board of directors, management, or key personnel;\n\u2022regulatory actions (including, but not limited to, developments in international trade policy) and enforcement actions bearing on manufacturing, development, marketing, or sales;\n\u2022the commencement or outcome of litigation;\n\u2022reports and recommendations of analysts and whether or not we meet the milestones, metrics, and other expectations set forth in such reports;\n\u2022gaining or losing large customers;\n\u2022the introduction of new products or services and market acceptance of such products or services;\n\u2022fluctuations in demand for our products or downturns in the industries that we serve, particularly the continued build-out of the capacity for the manufacture of OLED and the increased use of the installed base of our products in such manufacturing;\n\u2022the impact of any public health crisis on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects or those of our customers and suppliers;\n\u2022the acquisition or loss of significant manufacturers, distributors, or suppliers or an inability to obtain sufficient quantities of materials needed to provide our services;\n\u2022the issuance of common stock or other securities (including shares of common stock issued upon conversion of any shares of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock or upon conversion of our outstanding convertible notes);\n\u2022incurrence of indebtedness;\n\u2022quarterly variations in operating results;\n\u2022our ability to accurately forecast future performance;\n\u2022business acquisitions or divestitures;\n\u2022fluctuations in the economy, political events, or general market conditions; and\n\u2022changes in our operating industry generally.\nIn addition, stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years, including as a result of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, these fluctuations frequently have been unrelated to the operating performance or underlying fundamentals of the affected companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. These fluctuations may be unrelated to our performance or out of our control, and could lead to securities class action litigation that could result in substantial expenses and diversion of management\u2019s attention and corporate resources, any or all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe expect that the market price of our Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock will be influenced by yield and interest rates in the capital markets, the time remaining to the mandatory conversion date applicable to the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, our creditworthiness, and the occurrence of certain events affecting us that do not require an adjustment to the fixed conversion rates of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock. Fluctuations in yield rates in particular may give rise to arbitrage opportunities based upon changes in the relative values of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock and our common stock. Any such arbitrage could, in turn, affect the market prices of our common stock and the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock. The market price of our common stock could also be affected by possible sales of our common stock by investors who view the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock as a more attractive means of equity participation in us and by hedging or arbitrage trading activity that we expect to develop involving our common stock. This trading activity could, in turn, affect the market price of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock.\nProvisions in our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws and the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law may delay or prevent our acquisition by a third party, which could also reduce the market price of our capital stock.\nOur Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws contain provisions that could make us a less attractive target for a hostile takeover and could make more difficult or discourage a merger proposal, a tender offer, or a proxy contest. Such provisions include:\n\u2022a requirement that shareholder-nominated director nominees be nominated in advance of the meeting at which directors are elected and that specific information be provided in connection with such nomination;\n\u2022the ability of our board of directors to issue additional shares of common stock or preferred stock without shareholder approval; and\n\u2022certain provisions requiring supermajority approval (at least two-thirds of the votes cast by all shareholders entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class).\nIn addition, the BCL contains provisions that may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in our control or changes in our management. Many of these provisions are triggered if any person or group acquires, or discloses the intent to acquire, 20% or more of a corporation\u2019s voting power, subject to certain exceptions. These provisions:\n\u2022provide the other shareholders of the corporation with certain rights against the acquiring group or person;\n\u2022prohibit the corporation from engaging in a broad range of business combinations with the acquiring group or person;\n\u2022restrict the voting and other rights of the acquiring group or person; and\n\u2022provide that certain profits realized by the acquiring group or person from the sale of our equity securities belong to and are recoverable by us.\nRegardless of the amount of a person\u2019s holdings, if a shareholder or shareholder group (including affiliated persons) would be a party to certain proposed transactions with us or would be treated differently from other shareholders of ours in certain proposed transactions, the BCL requires approval by a majority of votes entitled to be cast by all shareholders other than the interested shareholder or affiliate group, unless the transaction is approved by independent directors or other criteria are satisfied. Furthermore, under the BCL, a \u201cshort-form\u201d merger of II-VI cannot be implemented without the consent of our board of directors.\nIn addition, as permitted by Pennsylvania law, an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation or other corporate action that is approved by shareholders may provide mandatory special treatment for specified groups of nonconsenting shareholders of the same class. For example, an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation or other corporate action may provide that shares of common stock held by designated shareholders of record must be cashed out at a price determined by the Company, subject to applicable dissenters\u2019 rights.\nFurthermore, the BCL provides that directors, in discharging their duties, may consider, to the extent they deem appropriate, the effects of any action upon shareholders, employees, suppliers, customers, and the communities in which the corporation\u2019s offices are located. Directors are not required to consider the interests of shareholders to a greater degree than other constituencies\u2019 interests. The BCL expressly provides that directors do not violate their fiduciary duties solely by relying on \u201cpoison pills\u201d or the anti-takeover provisions of the BCL. We do not currently have a \u201cpoison pill.\u201d\nAll of these provisions may limit the price that investors may be willing to pay for shares of our capital stock.\nIn addition, certain rights of the holders of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us. For example, if any of certain fundamental changes were to occur on or prior to July 1, 2023, holders of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock may have the right to convert their Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, at an increased conversion rate and will also be entitled to receive a make-whole amount equal to the present value of all remaining dividend payments on their Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, as described in the applicable Statement with Respect to Shares governing the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock. Likewise, if any of certain fundamental changes were to occur, we or the surviving entity would be required to make an offer to repurchase, at the option and election of the holders thereof, for cash each share of Series B Preferred Stock then outstanding. These features of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock could increase the cost of acquiring us or otherwise discourage a third party from acquiring us or removing incumbent management.\nWe do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock, holders will benefit from an investment in our common stock only if it appreciates in value and by the intended anti-dilution actions of our share-buyback program.\nWe have never declared nor paid dividends on our common stock and do not expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings to support operations and to finance the development of our business. As a result, the success of an investment in our common stock will depend entirely upon future appreciation in its value. There is no guarantee that our common stock will maintain its value or appreciate in value.\nOur ability to declare and pay dividends on our capital stock may be limited, including by the terms of our existing Credit Agreement.\nOur declaration and payment of dividends on our capital stock in the future will be determined by our board of directors (or an authorized committee thereof) in its sole discretion and will depend on our financial condition, earnings, growth prospects, other uses of cash, funding requirements, applicable Pennsylvania law, and other factors our board of directors deems relevant.\nThe terms of the New Credit Agreement contain a restriction on our ability to pay cash dividends on our capital stock. If the terms of the New Credit Agreement restrict our ability to pay cash dividends on the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, we will pay any dividends declared by our board of directors (or an authorized committee thereof) on the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock in the form of shares of common stock. In addition, credit facilities, indentures, or other financing agreements that we enter into in the future may contain provisions that restrict or prohibit our ability to pay cash dividends on our capital stock.\nIn addition, under Pennsylvania law, our board of directors may not pay dividends if after giving effect to the relevant dividend payment we (i) would not be able to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of our business or (ii) our total assets would not be greater than or equal to the sum of our total liabilities plus the amount that would be needed if we were to be dissolved at the time as of which the dividend is measured, in order to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of shareholders whose preferential rights are superior to those receiving the dividend. Even if we are permitted under our contractual obligations and Pennsylvania law to pay cash dividends on the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, we may not have sufficient cash to pay cash dividends on the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock\nTrading in preferred stock that we have issued may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe market price of our common stock is likely to be influenced by the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock and, to the extent that markets develop when applicable trading limitations no longer apply, our Series B Preferred Stock. For example, the market price of our common stock could become more volatile and could depress possible sales of our common stock to shareholders who view the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock as more attractive means of equity participation in us than owning shares of our common stock.\nOur common stock is subordinate to our existing and future indebtedness; the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock; and any other preferred stock we may issue in the future. Our Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock rank junior to all of our and our subsidiaries\u2019 consolidated liabilities.\nShares of our common stock are equity interests that rank junior to all indebtedness and other non-equity claims on us with respect to assets available to satisfy our claims, including in a liquidation of the Company. Additionally, holders of our common stock may be subject to prior dividend and liquidation rights of any holders of our preferred stock or depositary shares representing such preferred stock then outstanding.\nOur common stock ranks junior to our Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of dividends and amounts payable in the event of our liquidation, dissolution, or winding-up of our affairs. This means that, unless accumulated dividends have been paid on all the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock then outstanding through the most recently completed dividend period, no dividends may be declared or paid on our common stock and we will not be permitted to repurchase any of our common stock, subject to limited exceptions. Likewise, in the event of our voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, or winding-up of our affairs, no distribution of our assets may be made to holders of our common stock until we have paid to holders of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock then outstanding the applicable liquidation preferences.\nIn the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation, dissolution, or winding-up of our affairs, our assets will be available to pay obligations on the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock only after all of our consolidated liabilities have been paid. In addition, the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock rank structurally junior to all existing and future liabilities of our subsidiaries. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation, dissolution, or winding-up of our affairs, there may not be sufficient assets remaining, after paying our and our subsidiaries\u2019 liabilities, to pay amounts due on any or all of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock then outstanding.\nOur board of directors can issue, without approval of the holders of our common stock, preferred stock with voting and conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our common stock, the rights of holders of shares of our capital stock, or the market price of our capital stock.\nOur Articles of Incorporation authorize our board of directors to issue one or more additional series of preferred stock and set the terms of the preferred stock without seeking any further approval from our shareholders. Any preferred stock that is issued will rank ahead of our common stock in terms of dividends and liquidation rights. If we issue additional preferred stock, it may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Our board of directors also has the power, without shareholder approval, subject to applicable law, to set the terms of any such series of preferred stock that may be issued, including voting\nrights, dividend rights, preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends, and other terms, or upon our liquidation, dissolution, or winding-up of our affairs. If we issue additional preferred stock in the future that has a preference over our common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon our liquidation, dissolution, or winding-up of our affairs, or if we issue additional preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of our common stock, the rights of holders of our capital stock or the market price of our capital stock could be adversely affected. The issuance of preferred stock or even the ability to issue preferred stock could also have the effect of delaying, deterring, or preventing a change of control or other corporate action.\nThe redemption rights of the holders of Series B Preferred Stock may result in the use of our cash in such a way that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nAt any time on or after the ten-year anniversary of the applicable issuance date of the shares of our Series B Preferred Stock and subject to the procedures set forth in the terms of the Series B Preferred Stock, each holder of such shares will have the right to require us to redeem all of such holder\u2019s shares for cash at a price per share equal to the sum of the applicable stated value for such shares plus accrued or declared and unpaid dividends on such shares that had not previously been added to such stated value. This may have the effect of reducing funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes, thereby negatively affecting the interests of holders of our other capital stock, including our common stock and our Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock.\nHolders of our Series B Preferred Stock can exercise significant control over us, which could limit the ability of holders of our other capital stock to influence the outcome of key transactions, including a change of control.\nOur Series B Preferred Stock has voting rights, allowing holders to vote as one class with our common stock on an as-converted basis, subject to limited exceptions. As a result, the holders of Series B Preferred Stock have the ability to significantly influence the outcome of any matter submitted for the vote of the holders of our common stock. Holders of Series B Preferred Stock are entitled to act separately in their own respective interests with respect to their ownership interests in us and have the ability to substantially influence all matters that require approval by our shareholders, including the approval of significant corporate transactions. Additionally, we may not undertake certain actions without the prior written approval of the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock, voting separately from our common stock. Subject to certain exceptions, we must not: (1) alter or change the rights, preferences or privileges of our Series B Preferred Stock or amend, modify or supplement any provision of our organizational documents in a manner that adversely affects the rights, powers, preferences or privileges of our Series B Preferred Stock; (2) authorize or issue any senior stock (or securities convertible into senior stock), or amend or alter our articles of incorporation to increase the number of authorized or issued shares of our Series B Preferred Stock; (3) decrease the number of authorized shares of our Series B Preferred Stock (other than as permitted pursuant to a conversion, redemption or repurchase by us thereof); (4) issue any shares of our Series B Preferred Stock (other than pursuant to the amended and restated invested agreement, entered into on March 30, 2021, by and between Bain Capital Private Equity, LP (\u201cBCPE\u201d) and us (the \u201cInvestment Agreement\u201d); and (5) effect any voluntary deregistration or delisting with Nasdaq of our common stock.\nFurthermore, we may not, unless holders of Series B Preferred Stock otherwise consent in writing (or if such action is taken with respect to a Permitted Issuance (as defined in the Investment Agreement)), so long as BCPE owns at least 5% of the number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock that it held immediately following the issuance and sale of the Series B-2 Preferred Stock upon completion of our acquisition of Coherent, (i) authorize or issue any parity stock and (ii) pay any cash dividend on our common stock (other than ordinary dividends). We also may not, unless BCPE otherwise consents in writing (or if such action is taken with respect to a Permitted Issuance (as defined in the Investment Agreement)), so long as it owns at least 25% of the number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock that it held immediately following the issuance and sale of the Series B-2 Preferred Stock upon completion of our acquisition of Coherent, redeem, repurchase or otherwise acquire (or make or declare any dividend or distribution in respect of) any junior stock (subject to certain exceptions, including, among other things, ordinary dividends, non-cash dividends or other distributions paid pro rata to all holders of our common stock and, if applicable, holders of Series B Preferred Stock, repurchases of junior stock of up to $100 million on an aggregate annual basis and dividends on junior stock in kind or in the form of other junior securities or securities convertible into or exchange for such junior securities). Moreover, under the terms of the Investment Agreement, following the closing of the initial investment and for so long as BCPE beneficially owns shares of Series B Preferred Stock (or shares of our common stock issued upon the conversion thereof) that represent, in the aggregate and on an as-converted basis, at least 25% of the number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock that it held immediately following the completion of the issuance and sale of the Series B-2 Preferred Stock upon completion of our acquisition of Coherent, BCPE will have the right to nominate one designee and to designate one observer to the our board of directors. Circumstances may occur in which the interests of BCPE could conflict with the interests of holders of other outstanding capital stock, including our common stock and our Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock.\nReports published by securities or industry analysts, freelance bloggers and credit rating agencies, including projections in those reports that exceed our actual results, could adversely affect our share price and trading volume.\nResearch analysts and freelance bloggers publish their own quarterly projections regarding our operating results. These projections may vary widely from one another and may not accurately predict the results we actually achieve. Our share price may decline if we fail to meet securities research analysts\u2019 projections. Similarly, if one or more of the analysts who cover us change their recommendations regarding our common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our share price could decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, our share price or trading volume could decline.\nRegulatory actions may adversely affect the trading price and liquidity of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock.\nHolders of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock who employ, or seek to employ, a convertible arbitrage strategy with respect to the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock may be adversely impacted by regulatory developments that may limit or restrict such a strategy. The SEC and other regulatory and self-regulatory authorities have implemented various rules and may adopt additional rules in the future that restrict and otherwise regulate short selling, over-the-counter swaps, and security-based swaps, which restrictions and regulations may adversely affect the ability of investors in, or potential purchasers of, the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock to conduct a convertible arbitrage strategy with respect to the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock. This could, in turn, adversely affect the trading price and liquidity of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock.\nHolders of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock have no voting rights with respect to the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, except under limited circumstances.\nHolders of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock have no voting rights with respect to the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, except with respect to certain amendments to the terms of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, in the case of certain dividend arrearages, in certain other limited circumstances, and except as specifically required by applicable Pennsylvania law or by our amended and restated Articles of Incorporation. Holders of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock have no right to vote for any members of our board of directors, except in the case of certain dividend arrearages.\nIf dividends on any Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock have not been declared and paid for the equivalent of six or more dividend periods, whether or not for consecutive dividend periods, the holders of such Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class with holders of all other series of preferred stock ranking equally with the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock and having similar voting rights, will be entitled at our next special or annual meeting of shareholders to vote for the election of a total of two additional members of our board of directors, subject to certain limitations.\nWe depend on our subsidiaries for cash to fund our operations and expenses, including future dividend payments with respect to our outstanding preferred stock.\nA significant portion of our operations is conducted through our subsidiaries, and our ability to generate cash to meet our debt service obligations or to make future dividend payments with respect to the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock and, to the extent we elect to make such payments in cash, our Series B Preferred Stock is highly dependent on the earnings and the receipt of funds from our subsidiaries. Our subsidiaries are separate legal entities that have no obligation to make any funds available to us, whether by dividends, loans, or other payments.", "PERMNO": 11752, "SIC": 3827, "TIC": "IIVI"}
