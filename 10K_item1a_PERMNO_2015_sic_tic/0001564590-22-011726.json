Such risks and matters are numerous and diverse, may be experienced continuously or intermittently, and may vary in intensity and effect. Although the risks are organized by heading, and each risk is described separately, many of the risks are interrelated. Any of such risks and matters, individually or in combination, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, as well as on the attractiveness and value of an investment in the Company\u2019s securities. You should not interpret the disclosure of any risk factor to imply that the risk has not already materialized. While we believe we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be significant that may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in the future.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic Risks\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had and could continue to have a significant negative impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nSince the first quarter of fiscal 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the retail industry, including our business. Although the Company has experienced a strong recovery in operating results during fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020, the Company continues to monitor the impacts of COVID-19 on the macro economy as well as on the Company\u2019s and its vendor partners\u2019 operations. The full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is uncertain at this time, but we expect that it could continue to have adverse impacts on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nOn March 18, 2020, the Company temporarily closed all of its stores and subsequently furloughed the majority of its workforce. As states and localities began to ease the regulations imposed to slow the spread of COVID-19, the Company began to reopen its stores and by the end of the second quarter of 2020, substantially all of the Company\u2019s stores had reopened. The store closures resulted in a temporary material decline in revenue and operating cash flow. The Company has seen significant improvement in its operations in 2021. However, pockets of resurgence and variant strains of COVID-19 continue to emerge in parts of the world and the U.S., which could negatively impact future store performance if consumer shopping behaviors are impacted, the health of our customers and colleagues is compromised or government officials reinstate restrictions that impact our operations. As a result, there can be no assurance as to whether store closures may again be required.\n\u2022\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and particularly since the reopening of stores in 2020, the Company implemented safety measures and health and wellness precautions across its stores and facilities to mitigate risk to its customers and Company colleagues. These efforts to protect the health and well-being of customers and Company colleagues have resulted in, and will continue to result in, additional selling, general and administrative (\u201cSG&A\u201d) expenses. Further efforts to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, such as governmental requirements for employers to implement workforce vaccination-or-testing mandates, could require additional management time and focus and, possibly, significant SG&A expenses.\n\u2022\nDuring fiscal 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on economic conditions and discretionary consumer spending and consumer shopping behaviors in North America. In response to the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company reconfigured its cost base through colleague reductions, reduced discretionary spending and made investments to adapt to the changes in consumer behavior. An increased percentage of sales are now originating through digital channels. If digital sales penetration continues to increase and we are unable to offset the increased costs of fulfilling digital orders with margin expansion, delivery expense savings or other efficiencies, our results of operations could be adversely impacted.\n\u2022\nThe Company has experienced and may continue to experience delays in inventory receipts and temporary or long-term disruptions in its supply chain, as the outbreak has impacted manufacturing and distribution throughout the world. The receipt of products or raw material sourced from impacted areas has been and may continue to be slowed or disrupted, which could impact the Company\u2019s private brands or the fulfillment of merchandise orders from the Company\u2019s brand partners. Furthermore, transportation delays, worker shortages and cost increases have impacted and may continue to impact the Company, its suppliers\u2019 operations and its customers.\n\u2022\nThe Company\u2019s liquidity was negatively impacted by closures of its stores in fiscal 2020. In response, the Company took several actions to increase liquidity and financial flexibility, including entering into a new $2.9 billion asset-based credit facility and issuing $1.3 billion in aggregate principal amount of 8.375% senior secured notes due 2025 (the \u201c2025 Notes\u201d). Although the Company redeemed the entire outstanding $1.3 billion aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes in 2021, had no borrowings outstanding under the asset-based credit facility at the end of fiscal 2021, and repaid $280 million of debt prior to maturity in fiscal 2022, further resurgences of COVID-19 in the future may require the Company to incur additional debt to improve its cash position.\nThe duration and extent of the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic depends on future developments that cannot be accurately predicted at this time, such as the severity and transmission rate of the virus, the emergence and spread of variants, infection rates in areas where the Company operates, the extent and effectiveness of containment actions, including the continued availability and effectiveness of vaccines in the markets where the Company operates, and the impact of these and other factors on the Company\u2019s employees, customers, suppliers, distributors, and manufacturers. As such, the Company will continue to assess the highly uncertain financial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Further disruption of the global economy and related impacts on the Company\u2019s business may lead to triggering events that may indicate that the carrying value of certain assets, including inventories, long-lived assets, intangibles, and goodwill, may not be recoverable.\nThe impact of COVID-19 may also exacerbate other risks included in in this section, any of which could be material. The situation is continually changing, and future impacts may materialize that are not yet known.\nStrategic, Operational and Competitive Risks\nOur strategic plans and initiatives may not be successful, which could negatively affect our profitability and growth.\nIn 2020, we announced the Polaris strategy, a multi-year plan designed to stabilize profitability and position the Company for sustainable, profitable growth. Over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have refined the components of the Polaris strategy to focus where we believe we can create differentiation and drive competitive advantage, including a focus on winning with fashion and style, delivering clear value, excelling in digital shopping, enhancing store experience, modernizing supply chain and enabling transformation. Our digitally-led omni-channel strategy is committed to creating a seamless integration between physical stores and digital shopping. We plan to continue our focus on strengthening our omni-channel capabilities with investments in digital shopping experiences, data and analytics, technology infrastructure and more efficient fulfillment capabilities. These initiatives have required and will continue to require our management, colleagues, and contractors to make transformational changes in our business operations and to improve productivity. These initiatives are also subject to the ability to attract and retain skilled personnel to support the initiatives. Our ability to achieve sustainable, profitable growth is subject to the successful implementation of our strategic plans, including the Polaris strategy, and realization of anticipated benefits and savings. If we are unable to successfully execute our strategic plans and initiatives to achieve the intended results or these investments or initiatives do not perform as expected or create implementation or operational challenges, our profitability and growth could suffer.\nOur sales and operating results depend on our ability to anticipate and respond to consumer preferences and manage our inventory and merchandise selection.\nThe fashion and retail industries are subject to sudden shifts in consumer trends and consumer spending. Our sales and operating results depend in part on our ability to predict or respond to changes in fashion trends and consumer preferences in a timely manner. We develop new retail concepts and continuously adjust our inventory position in certain major and private-label brands and product categories in an effort to attract and retain customers. Any sustained failure to anticipate, identify and respond to emerging trends in lifestyle and consumer preferences could negatively affect our business and results of operations.\nOur profitability depends on our ability to manage inventory levels and merchandise selection. Overestimating customer demand for merchandise will likely result in the need to record unplanned and incremental inventory markdowns and sell excess inventory at clearance prices, which would negatively impact our gross margins and operating results. Underestimating customer demand for merchandise can lead to inventory shortages, missed sales opportunities and negative customer experiences.\nThe Company faces significant competition and challenges as consumers continue to migrate to online shopping and depends on its ability to differentiate itself in retail's ever-changing environment.\nWe conduct our retail merchandising business under highly competitive conditions. Although Macy's, Inc. is one of the nation\u2019s largest retailers, we have numerous and varied competitors at the national and local levels, including department stores, specialty stores, general merchandise stores, manufacturers\u2019 outlets, off-price and discount stores, online retailers and catalogs, among others. Competition is characterized by many factors, including assortment, advertising, price, quality, service, location, reputation and credit availability. Any failure by us to compete effectively could negatively affect our business and results of operations.\nAs consumers continue to migrate online, a trend that has accelerated with the COVID-19 pandemic, we face pressures to not only compete from a price perspective with our competitors, some of whom sell the same products, but also to differentiate Macy's, Inc\u2019s. merchandise offerings, services and shopping experiences to stay relevant in retail's ever-changing environment. We continue to significantly invest in our omnichannel capabilities, seeking to improve the profitability of our digital business through delivery expense reduction, gross margin expansion and other initiatives to support digital sales growth. We also are seeking to improve the delivery experience of our customers with strategic investments to fulfill digital sales demand and elevated delivery speed expectations. Insufficient, untimely or misguided investments in these areas could significantly impact our profitability and growth.\nIn addition, a continued decline of customer store traffic and migration of sales from brick-and-mortar stores to digital platforms could lead to additional store closures, restructuring and other costs that could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows.\nOur ability to grow depends in part on our stores remaining relevant to customers.\nWe have invested in facilities and fixtures upgrades, merchandise assortment and customer service in selected stores to improve customer retention rates and overall customer satisfaction. We have also opened new off-mall smaller store formats - Market by Macy\u2019s and Bloomie\u2019s - in selected markets to promote customer acquisition, test replacement, expansion or market entry locations, and support our omni-market capabilities. While these store investments and off-mall store formats are intended to improve the customer store experience and drive traffic, realization of these benefits may not occur.\nBecause we rely on the ability of our physical retail locations to attract customers, provide full or curated merchandise selections, drive traffic to digital channels and assist in fulfillment, returns and other omni-channel functions, providing a desirable and sought-out shopping experience is important to our financial success. Changes in consumer shopping habits, an over-malled/over-retailed environment, financial difficulties at other anchor tenants, significant mall vacancy issues, mall violence and new on- and off-mall developments could each adversely impact the traffic at current retail locations and lead to a decline in our financial condition or performance.\nWe may not be able to successfully execute our real estate strategy.\nWe continue to explore opportunities to monetize our real estate portfolio, including sales of stores as well as non-store real estate, such as warehouses, outparcels and parking garages. We also continue to evaluate our real estate portfolio to identify opportunities where the redevelopment value of our real estate exceeds the value of non-strategic operating locations. This strategy is multi-pronged and may include transactions, strategic alliances or other arrangements with mall developers or other unrelated third-parties. Due to the cyclical nature of real estate markets, the performance of our real estate strategy is inherently volatile and could have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial condition.\nOur revenues and cash requirements are affected by the seasonal nature of our business.\nOur business is seasonal, with a high proportion of revenues and operating cash flows generated during the second half of the year, which includes the fall and the months of November and December. A disproportionate amount of our revenues is realized in the fourth quarter due to this seasonality. Should sales during this period fall below our expectations, a disproportionately negative impact on our annual results of operations could occur.\nWe generally incur significant additional expenses in the period leading up to the months of November and December in anticipation of higher sales volume in those periods, including costs for additional inventory, advertising and employees. If we are not successful in executing our sales strategy during this period, we may have to sell the inventory at significantly reduced prices or may not be able to sell the inventory at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nWe depend on our ability to attract, train, develop and retain quality colleagues.\nOur business is dependent upon attracting, training, developing and retaining quality employees at all levels of the organization, and management personnel to develop and effectively execute successful business strategies. Macy's, Inc. has a large number of employees, many of whom are in entry level or part-time positions with historically high rates of turnover. Our ability to meet labor needs while controlling costs associated with hiring and training new employees is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates, minimum wage legislation and changing demographics. In recent years, low unemployment, labor shortages, intense competition for talent and a competitive wage environment have impacted our ability to attract, recruit and retain talent. In addition, the continued uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, including changing national and local regulations related to protective measures to mitigate the spread of the virus, could cause us to incur additional unexpected labor costs and other expenses and impact our ability to attract, recruit or retain employees needed for our operations.\nIncreases in labor costs and the cost of employee benefits could impact our financial results and cash flow.\nMinimum wage increases by states and wage and benefit increases to attract and retain workers in a tight labor market have increased labor costs in the retail sector. These increased costs pressure our margins and could have a negative impact on our financial results.\nOur expenses relating to employee health benefits are significant. Recent medical plan cost increases have been driven by pandemic-related business impacts, increases in participation and claims under continued health insurance coverage after leaving employment, and pharmacy claims increases. Unfavorable changes in the cost of employee health benefits could negatively affect our financial results and cash flow. Healthcare costs have risen significantly in recent years, and legislative and private sector initiatives regarding healthcare reform have resulted and could continue to result in significant changes to the U.S. healthcare system. Due to uncertainty regarding legislative or regulatory changes, we are not able to fully determine the impact that future healthcare reform could have on our company-sponsored medical plans.\nIf cash flows from our private label and co-branded credit cards decrease, our financial and operational results may be negatively impacted.\nIn 2005, in connection with the sale of most of the Company's credit card accounts and related receivable balances to Citibank, N.A. (\u201cCitibank\u201d), the Company and Citibank entered into a long-term marketing and servicing alliance pursuant to the terms of a Credit Card Program Agreement (\"Credit Card Program\"). Subsequent to this initial arrangement and associated amendments, on December 13, 2021, the Company entered into the sixth amendment to the amended and restated Credit Card Program with Citibank (the \u201cProgram Agreement\u201d), pursuant to which Citibank issues, maintains and services Macy\u2019s and Bloomingdale\u2019s private label and co-branded credit cards. Under the Program Agreement, which extends until March 31, 2030, Citibank owns the credit card receivables generated from sales through the credit cards and Macy\u2019s receives fees and shares in profits based on a tiered return on the receivables portfolio net of program expenses. Credit card revenues, net were $832 million, or approximately 3.4% of net sales, for 2021. Deterioration in economic conditions could adversely affect the volume of new credit accounts, the amount of credit card program balances and the ability of credit card holders to pay their balances. These conditions could result in the Company receiving lower payments under the credit card program.\nIn addition, recent shifts from sales through our proprietary credit cards to debit products and alternative buy-now-pay-later payment methods may result in increased costs and could have a negative impact to credit card revenues due to potentially reduced credit card receivable balances.\nCredit card operations are subject to many federal and state laws that may impose certain requirements and limitations on credit card providers. Citibank and our subsidiary bank, FDS Bank, may be required to comply with regulations that may negatively impact the operation of our proprietary credit card. This negative impact may affect our revenue streams derived from the credit cards receivables portfolio and our financial results.\nOur defined benefit plan funding requirements or plan settlement expense could impact our financial results and cash flow.\nSignificant changes in interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and timing and amount of benefit payments could affect the funded status of our plans and could increase future funding requirements of the plans. A significant increase in future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our cash flows, financial condition or results of operations.\nThese plans allow eligible retiring employees to receive lump sum distributions of benefits earned. Under applicable accounting rules, if annual lump sum distributions exceed an actuarially determined threshold of the total of the annual service and interest costs, we would be required to recognize in the current period of operations a settlement expense of a portion of the unrecognized actuarial loss, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nIf our Company\u2019s reputation and brand image are not maintained at a high level, our operations and financial results may suffer.\nWe believe our reputation and brand image are partially based on the perception that we act equitably and honestly in dealing with our customers, employees, business partners and shareholders. Our reputation and brand image may be deteriorated by any incident that erodes the trust or confidence of our customers or the general public, particularly if the incident results in significant adverse publicity or governmental inquiry. Information about us, whether or not true, may be instantly posted on social media platforms at any time, which could adversely impact our reputation or brand image. The harm could be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction. If our reputation or brand image is damaged, our customers may refuse to continue shopping with us, potential employees may be unwilling to work for us, business partners may be discouraged from seeking future business dealings with us and, as a result, our business and results of operations may suffer.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property, our brands and business could be damaged.\nWe believe that our copyrights, trademarks, trade dress, trade secrets and similar intellectual property are important assets and key elements of our strategy, including those related to our private brand merchandise. We rely on copyright and trademark law, trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, vendors and others to protect our proprietary rights. If the steps we take to protect our proprietary rights are inadequate, or if we are unable to protect or preserve the value of our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and other proprietary rights for any reason, our merchandise brands and business could be negatively affected.\nInfrastructure Risks\nUnforeseen disruptions in our distribution and fulfillment centers could have an adverse impact on our business and operations.\nOur business depends on the orderly receipt and distribution of merchandise and effective management of our distribution and fulfillment centers. Unforeseen disruptions in operations due to fire, severe weather conditions (including those that may be caused by climate change), natural disasters, health pandemics or other catastrophic events, labor disagreements, or other shipping problems may result in the loss or unavailability of inventory and/or delays in the delivery of merchandise to our stores, fulfillment centers and customers.\nA material disruption in our information technology systems could adversely affect our business or results of operations.\nWe rely extensively on our information technology systems to process transactions, summarize results and manage our business. Our information technology systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, cyber-attack or other security breaches, catastrophic events such as fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, acts of war or terrorism, and usage errors by our employees. If our information technology systems are materially damaged or cease to function properly, including a material disruption in our ability to authorize and process transactions at our stores or on our online systems, we may have to make a significant investment to fix or replace them, and we may suffer loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our operations. Any material interruption in our information technology systems could negatively affect our business and results of operations.\nIf our technology-based e-commerce systems do not function properly, our operating results could be negatively affected.\nCustomers are increasingly shopping online. We strive to anticipate and meet our customers\u2019 changing expectations and are focused on building a seamless shopping experience across our omnichannel business. Any failure to provide user-friendly, secure e-commerce platforms that offer merchandise, delivery options and shopping experiences that resonate with customers could place us at a competitive disadvantage, result in the loss of online and other sales, harm our reputation with customers and have a material adverse impact on the growth of our business and our operating results.\nInformation Security, Cybersecurity, Privacy and Data Management Risks\nA breach of our information technology systems could adversely affect our reputation, business partner and customer relationships and operations, and result in high costs.\nThrough our sales, marketing activities, and use of third-party information, we collect and store certain non-public personal information that customers provide to purchase products or services, enroll in promotional programs, register on websites, or otherwise communicate to us. This may include phone numbers, driver license numbers, contact preferences, personal information stored on electronic devices, and payment information, including credit and debit card data. We gather and retain information about employees in the normal course of business. We may share information about such persons with vendors that assist with certain aspects of our business. In addition, our online operations depend upon the transmission of confidential information over the Internet, such as information permitting cashless payments.\nWe employ safeguards for the protection of this information and have made significant investments to secure access to our information technology network, the importance of which has increased due to many of our colleagues working remotely as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. For instance, we have implemented authentication protocols, installed firewalls and anti-virus/anti-malware software, established data security breach preparedness and response plans, and conduct continuous risk assessments. We also employ encryption and other methods to protect our data, promote security awareness with our employees and work with business partners in an effort to create secure and compliant systems.\nProtections we have in place to safeguard this information may be compromised as a result of third-party security breaches, theft, cyberattacks, errors by employees or employees of third-party vendors, or contractors, misappropriation of data by employees, vendors or unaffiliated third-parties, or other irregularities that may result in persons obtaining unauthorized access to company data.\nRetail data frequently targeted by cybercriminals includes consumer credit card data, personally identifiable information, including social security numbers, and health care information. For retailers, point of sale and e-commerce websites are often attacked through compromised credentials, including those obtained through phishing, vishing and credential stuffing. Other methods of attack include advanced malware, the exploitation of software and operating vulnerabilities, and physical device tampering/skimming at card reader units. We believe these attack methods will continue to evolve. In addition, the risk of cyber-based attacks is heightened with many of our employees working and accessing our technology infrastructure remotely as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nCyber threats are increasing in scope, sophistication and frequency and bad actors are exploiting vulnerabilities to gain access to networks for the purpose of implementing ransomware, which is used to encrypt and steal data and causes public facing business interruptions. Our ability to react, mitigate and restore services from an interruption of our systems and processes is key to avoiding adverse financial impacts resulting from loss of sales, services and the cost of paying a ransom.\nRemote work due to the COVID-19 pandemic has also created additional challenges to our ability to protect remote workers, corporate networks and cloud environments. We are identifying, tracking and mitigating advanced phishing, malware and credential compromises daily. These attacks are typically occurring on home networks and migrate to the corporate network. However, despite instituting controls for the protection of information, the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service change frequently and our systems and networks may nevertheless remain vulnerable to threats and attacks. To date, no cybersecurity incident or attack has had a material impact on our business or results of operations. Unauthorized parties may attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities, or those of third parties with whom we do business, through fraud, trickery, or other forms of deception to employees, contractors, vendors and temporary staff. During the normal course of business, we have experienced and expect to continue to experience attempts to compromise our information systems. We may be unable to protect the integrity of our systems or company data. An alleged or actual unauthorized access or unauthorized disclosure of non-public personal information could:\n\u2022\nmaterially damage our reputation and brand, negatively affect customer satisfaction and loyalty, expose us to individual claims or consumer class actions, administrative, civil or criminal investigations or actions, and infringe on proprietary information; and\n\u2022\ncause us to incur substantial costs, including costs associated with remediation of information technology systems, customer protection costs and incentive payments for the maintenance of business relationships, litigation costs, lost revenues resulting from negative changes in consumer shopping patterns, unauthorized use of proprietary information or the failure to retain or attract customers following an attack. While we maintain insurance coverage that may, subject to policy terms and conditions, cover certain aspects of cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be unavailable or insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise in the continually evolving area of cyber risk.\nSupply Chain and Third-Party Risks\nWe depend on vendors and other sources of merchandise, goods and services outside the U.S. Our business could be affected by disruptions in, or other legal, regulatory, political, economic or public health issues associated with, our supply network.\nWe depend on vendors for timely and efficient access to products we sell. We source the majority of our merchandise from manufacturers located outside the U.S., primarily Asia. In the normal course of business, we provide credit enhancement to our vendors to support accounts receivable factoring and financing with third parties. Current economic conditions may adversely impact our vendors and they may be unable to access financing or become insolvent and unable to supply us with products, or we may be required to increase cash collateral levels or provide guarantees to support our vendors\u2019 financing arrangements. Any major changes in tax policy, such as the disallowance of tax deductions for imported merchandise could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and liquidity.\nIn recent months, we have experienced delays in merchandise inventory receipts and product delivery due to a continuing global shortage of vessels and air freight, port congestion, a global worker shortage impacting shipping and ports, truck driver shortages, rail congestion at major freight hubs and increasing demand for consumer goods. Although these delays have not materially impacted our operations to date, they could potentially have a material adverse impact on future product availability, product mix and sales if the delays do not improve. We are also experiencing increases in shipping rates from Trans-Pacific ocean carriers due increases in spot market rates and to shortage of shipping capacity from China and other parts of Asia, and increases in trucking costs due to truck driver shortages and fuel costs.\nThe procurement of all our goods and services is subject to the effects of price increases, which we may or may not be able to pass through to our customers. In addition, our procurement of goods and services from outside the U.S. is subject to risks associated with political or financial instability, trade restrictions, tariffs, currency exchange rates, transport capacity and costs, health pandemics and other factors relating to foreign trade. All of these factors may affect our ability to access suitable merchandise on acceptable terms, are beyond our control and could negatively affect our business, results of operations and liquidity.\nIn recent years, the U.S. has been engaged in extended trade negotiations with China, which has resulted in the implementation of tariffs on a significant number of products manufactured in China and imported into the U.S. While recent tariffs and modifications to trade agreements have not resulted in a material impact on our business, results of operations, and liquidity to date, any additional actions, if ultimately enacted, could negatively impact our ability and the ability of our third-party vendors and suppliers to source products from foreign jurisdictions, which could lead to an increase in the cost of goods and adversely affect the Company\u2019s profitability.\nWe continue to evaluate the impact of currently effective tariffs, including potential future retaliatory tariffs, as well as other recent changes in foreign trade policy and the U.S. Administration on our supply chain, costs, sales and profitability, and are working through strategies to mitigate such impact, including reviewing sourcing options and working with our vendors and merchants. At this time, it is unknown how long U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods will remain in effect or whether additional tariffs will be imposed. Depending upon their duration and implementation, as well as our ability to mitigate their impact, these changes in foreign trade policy and any recently enacted, proposed and future tariffs on products imported by us from China could negatively impact our business, results of operations and liquidity if they seriously disrupt the movement of products through our supply chain or increase their cost. In addition, while we may be able to shift our sourcing options, executing such a shift would be time consuming and would be difficult or impracticable for many products and may result in an increase in our manufacturing costs. The adoption and expansion of trade restrictions, retaliatory tariffs, or other governmental action related to tariffs or international trade agreements or policies has the potential to adversely impact demand for our products, our costs, our customers, our suppliers, and/or the U.S. economy, which in turn could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nIf our vendors, or any raw material vendors on which our vendors or our private label business relies, suffer prolonged manufacturing or transportation disruptions due to public health conditions or other unforeseen events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, our ability to source product could be adversely impacted which would adversely affect our results of operations.\nDisruption of global sourcing activities and quality and other concerns over our own brands could negatively impact brand reputation and earnings.\nEconomic and civil unrest in areas of the world where we source products, as well as shipping and dockage issues, could adversely impact the availability or cost of our products, or both. Most of the Company\u2019s goods imported to the U.S. arrive from Asia through ports located on the U.S. west coast and are subject to potential disruption due to labor unrest or shortages, security issues or natural disasters affecting any or all of these ports. In addition, in recent years, we have substantially increased the number and types of merchandise that are sold under the Company\u2019s proprietary brands. While we have focused on the quality of our proprietary branded products, we rely on third-parties to manufacture these products. Such third-party manufacturers may prove to be unreliable, the quality of our globally sourced products may vary from expectations and standards, the products may not meet applicable regulatory requirements which may require us to recall these products, or the products may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of third-parties. We face challenges in seeking indemnities from manufacturers of these products, including the uncertainty of recovering on such indemnity and the lack of understanding by manufacturers of U.S. product liability laws in certain foreign jurisdictions.\nWe also face concerns relating to human rights, working conditions and other labor rights, and conditions and environmental impact in factories or countries where merchandise that we sell is produced, as well as concerns about transparent sourcing and supply chains. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with laws and regulations relating to production of merchandise, doing business in foreign countries and importing merchandise, and to screen, train and monitor our private label vendors to ensure safe and ethical treatment of workers in our supply chain, there can be no assurance that our vendors and other third parties with whom we do business will not violate such laws and regulations or our policies, which could subject us to liability and could adversely impact our reputation, results of operations and business.\nMaterial disruptions in relationships with third-parties with whom the Company does business could adversely affect its operations.\nThe Company is a party to contracts, transactions and business relationships with various third parties, including suppliers, service providers, lenders and participants in joint ventures, strategic alliances and other commercial relationships. In some cases, we depend upon such third parties to provide products, services, advertising, technology infrastructure, development and support, data analytics, logistics, other goods and services to operate our business in the ordinary course, extensions of credit, credit card accounts and related receivables, and other matters. Furthermore, third-party vendors may sell products directly to consumers in addition to, or in some cases in lieu of, traditional wholesale channels such as independent stores and retail chains. As our business model depends on offering quality and relevant merchandise brands from third-party vendors in addition to our own private label products, any material disruption in our relationship with such vendors, or material disruption in the products or services provided by other third parties, could adversely affect our revenues, expense structure, earnings and operations.\nEconomic, Global, Legal and External Risks\nThe Company\u2019s business is subject to discretionary consumer spending, unfavorable economic and political conditions, and other related risks.\nOur sales are significantly affected by changes in discretionary spending by consumers. Consumer spending may be affected by many factors outside of our control, including general economic conditions, consumer disposable income levels, consumer confidence levels, the availability, cost and level of consumer debt, consumer behaviors towards incurring and paying debt, the cost of basic necessities and other goods, the strength of the U.S. Dollar relative to foreign currencies and the effects of the weather, natural disasters or health pandemics. These factors can have psychological or economic impacts on consumers that affect their discretionary spending habits. Any decline in discretionary spending by consumers could negatively affect our business and results of operations.\nUnfavorable global, domestic or regional economic or political conditions and other developments and risks could negatively affect our business and results of operations. For example, unfavorable changes related to interest rates, rates of economic growth, fiscal and monetary policies of governments, inflation, deflation, tax rates and policy, unemployment trends, energy prices, and other matters that influence the availability and cost of merchandise, consumer\nconfidence, spending and tourism could negatively affect our business and results of operations. Unstable political conditions, civil unrest, terrorist activities, armed conflicts or events of extreme violence, including any escalation of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, may disrupt commerce and could negatively affect our business and results of operations.\nOur business could be materially adversely affected by extreme weather conditions, natural disasters or regional or global health pandemics.\nExtreme weather conditions, including those that may be caused by climate change, in the areas in which our stores are located could negatively affect our business and results of operations. For example, frequent or unusually heavy snowfall, ice storms, rainstorms or other extreme weather conditions over a prolonged period could make it difficult for our customers to travel to our stores and thereby reduce our sales and profitability. Our business is also susceptible to unseasonable weather conditions. For example, extended periods of unseasonably warm temperatures during the winter season or cool weather during the summer season could reduce demand for a portion of our inventory and thereby reduce our sales and profitability. In addition, extreme weather conditions could result in disruption or delay of production and delivery of materials and products in our supply chain and cause staffing shortages in our stores.\nNatural disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes and earthquakes, or a combination of these or other factors, could damage or destroy our facilities or make it difficult for customers to travel to our stores, thereby negatively affecting our business and results of operations.\nPublic concern regarding the risk of contracting COVID-19 and any related variants could have a material and adverse effect on our business. The continued development of the COVID-19 pandemic could also impact future economic activity, which could lead to increased unemployment and significantly impact consumer confidence and discretionary spending.\nLitigation, legislation, regulatory developments or non-compliance could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations, inquiries and initiatives in connection with both our core business operations and our credit card and other ancillary operations (including the Credit Card Act of 2009 and the Home Owners\u2019 Loan Act of 1933). Recent and future developments relating to such matters could increase our compliance costs and adversely affect the profitability of our credit card and other operations. Our effective tax rate is impacted by a number of factors, including changes in federal or state tax law, interpretation of existing laws and the ability to defend and support the tax positions taken on historical tax returns. Certain changes in any of these factors could materially impact the Company\u2019s effective tax rate and net income.\nWe are also subject to anti-bribery, customs, child labor, truth-in-advertising and other laws, including consumer protection regulations and zoning and occupancy ordinances that regulate retailers generally and/or govern the importation, promotion and sale of merchandise and the operation of retail stores and warehouse facilities. Although we undertake to monitor changes in these laws, if these laws change without our knowledge, or are violated by importers, designers, manufacturers, distributors or agents, we could experience delays in shipments and receipt of goods or be subject to fines or other penalties under the controlling regulations, any of which could negatively affect our business and results of operations. In addition, we are regularly involved in various litigation matters that arise in the ordinary course of our business. Adverse outcomes in current or future litigation could negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nChanges in applicable environmental regulations, including increased or additional regulations to limit carbon emissions or other greenhouse gases may result in increased compliance costs, capital expenditures and other financial obligations which could affect our profitability.\nIn addition, our business is subject to complex and rapidly evolving laws addressing data privacy and data protection and companies are under increased regulatory scrutiny with respect to these matters. The Federal Trade Commission and many state attorneys general are interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards for the online collection, use, dissemination and security of data. The interpretation and application of existing laws regarding data privacy and data protection are in flux and many states are considering new regulations in this area. The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) and other applicable U.S. privacy laws or new state or federal laws may limit our ability to collect and use data, require us to modify our data processing practices or result in the possibility of fines, litigation or orders which may have an adverse effect on our business and\nresults of operations. The burdens imposed by these and other laws and regulations that may be enacted, or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, may also require us to incur substantial costs to reach compliance or change the manner in which we use data.\nOur sales and operating results could be adversely affected by product safety concerns.\nIf our merchandise offerings do not meet applicable safety standards or consumers' expectations regarding safety, we could experience decreased sales, increased costs and/or be exposed to legal and reputational risk. Events that give rise to actual, potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to government enforcement action and/or private litigation. Reputational damage caused by real or perceived product safety concerns could negatively affect our business and results of operations.\nClimate Change-Related Risks\nClimate change, or legal, regulatory, or market measures to address climate change, could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe have identified certain climate change-related risks that may impact our business over the short-, medium- and long-term. The nature of these risks depends on both the physical aspects of climate change as well as legal, regulatory, and market requirements, pressure to reduce our carbon footprint and our ability to understand and respond to rapidly evolving developments. Climate change and related measures could have adverse impacts on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nRegulatory Risks. Unfavorable global, domestic or regional economic or political conditions and other developments and risks could negatively affect our business and results of operations. For example, energy or carbon policies (both existing and emerging) that apply to our energy suppliers have the ability to impact indirect costs to our operations through shifts in energy prices. Current environmental and climate-related regulation, both at the state and federal levels, are monitored as part of our enterprise risk management process.\n\u2022\nReputational Risk. Maintaining our Company\u2019s reputation and brand image at a high level is critical to our operations and financial results. We believe our reputation and brand image are partially based on the perception that we act equitably and honestly in dealing with customers, employees, business partners and shareholders. Reputational risk in relation to climate-related issues encompasses both supply chain issues (e.g., supply disruption caused by weather events) and our position and progress toward cleaner energy production and consumption.\n\u2022\nRisk Related to Resource Use. There is increasing scrutiny on the use of resources, particularly energy sources and energy use. Pressure from regulators, consumers and other stakeholders to find alternatives and/or green solutions to sharply reduce our use of natural resources are escalating. We continue to look for ways to address these issues and continue to explore developing best practices within the industry. Through memberships in industry groups such as the Sustainable Apparel Coalition (SAC), we are working to reduce the environmental and social impact of apparel and footwear products around the world. The use of recycled material textiles emits fewer greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and conserves water and energy as compared to making virgin fiber. Additionally, we have rolled out a framework to measure the social and environmental performance of over 500 facilities, benchmarking by facility type to allow comparison of performance against that of peers.\n\u2022\nExtreme Weather Events and Natural Disasters. The risk of extreme weather events is integrated into our climate change-related enterprise risk management assessment. Our business could be affected by extreme weather conditions, regional or global health pandemics or natural disasters. Extreme weather conditions, such as frequent or unusually heavy snowfall, ice storms, rainstorms or natural disasters such as wildfire over a prolonged period could make it difficult for our customers to travel to our stores and thereby reduce our sales and profitability. Our business is also susceptible to unseasonable weather conditions, which could reduce demand for a portion of our inventory and reduce sales and profitability or could result in disruption or delay of materials in our supply chain or impact staffing in our stores.\nFinancial Risks\nInability to access capital markets could adversely affect our business or financial condition.\nChanges in the credit and capital markets, including market disruptions, limited liquidity and interest rate fluctuations, may increase the cost of financing or restrict our access to this potential source of future liquidity. A downgrade in the ratings that rating agencies assign to the Company\u2019s short- and long-term debt has and may continue to negatively impact our access to the debt capital markets and increase our cost of borrowing. In addition, our asset-based credit facility requires us to maintain a specified fixed charge coverage ratio. Our ability to comply with the ratio may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. If our results of operations deteriorate to a point where we are not in compliance with our debt covenants, and we are unable to obtain a waiver, much of our debt would be in default and could become due and payable immediately. Our assets may not be sufficient to repay in full this indebtedness, resulting in a need for an alternate source of funding. We cannot make any assurances that we would be able to obtain such an alternate source of funding on satisfactory terms, if at all, and our inability to do so could cause the holders of our securities to experience a partial or total loss of their investments in the Company.\nOur level of indebtedness may adversely affect our ability to operate our business, remain in compliance with debt covenants, react to changes in our business or the industry in which we operate, or prevent us from making payments on our indebtedness.\nAs of January 29, 2022, the aggregate principal amount of our total outstanding indebtedness was $3,295 million. Our level of indebtedness could have important consequences for the holders of our debt and equity securities. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and external conditions, including the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022\nimpair our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or general corporate or other purposes;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a material portion of our cash flows from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flows to fund working capital needs, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nexpose us to the risk of increased interest rates to the extent we make borrowings under our asset-based credit facility, which bears interest at a variable rate;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\nplace us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness; and\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to adjust to changing market conditions.\nAny of these risks could materially impact our ability to fund our operations or limit our ability to expand our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 77462, "SIC": 5311, "TIC": "M"}
