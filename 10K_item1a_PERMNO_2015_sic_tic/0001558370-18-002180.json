You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with the other information contained in this Annual Report, including our financial statements and the related notes appearing at the end of this Annual Report, before making any investment decision regarding our securities. We cannot assure you that any of the events discussed in the risk factors below will not occur. These risks could have a material and adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, and our future prospects would likely be materially and adversely affected. As a result, the trading price of our securities could decline and you may lose part or all of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Capital Needs\nWe have incurred significant losses since our inception and have a history of net losses and negative cash flow from operations.\nWe are a pharmaceutical company at an early stage of commercialization with a limited operating and commercialization history. To date, we have focused on developing ARYMO ER, our product that was approved in January 2017, and our product candidate, Egalet-002, as well as commercializing SPRIX Nasal Spray, OXAYDO and ARYMO ER. Investment in pharmaceutical product development is highly speculative because it entails substantial upfront capital expenditures and significant risk that a product candidate will fail to gain regulatory approval or become commercially viable. Similarly, investment in the commercialization of a product may be slow to achieve results. As a result, there is little historical basis upon which to assess how we will respond to competitive or economic challenges or other challenges to our business. Our business and prospects must be considered in light of the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by pharmaceutical companies in the early stages of commercialization in a difficult and changing environment.\nWe have generated substantial net losses and negative cash flow from operations since our inception, and we continue to incur significant commercialization and other expenses related to our ongoing operations for our products. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we reported a net loss of approximately $69.4 million, $90.6 million and $57.9 million, respectively.\nWe expect to incur losses and negative cash flow for the foreseeable future. Our ability to generate sufficient revenues from our products, any products that we may in-license or acquire, and, if approved, Egalet-002 and any other product candidates that we may develop and partner, will depend on numerous factors described in the following risk factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report. We expect that our gross margin may fluctuate from period to period as a result of changes in product mix sold, potentially by the introduction of new products by us or our competitors, manufacturing efficiencies related to our products and a variety of other factors. Even if we achieve profitability in the\nfuture, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods. Our prior losses and expected future losses have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders\u2019 equity and working capital.\nWe currently generate limited revenue from the sale of products and may never become profitable.\nTo date, we have generated $47.2 million in total revenue from SPRIX Nasal Spray, OXAYDO and ARYMO ER, and have generated $22.6 million in total revenue since our inception from feasibility and collaboration agreements. Under our collaboration agreement with Shionogi, we received a $10.0 million upfront payment in December 2013 and an additional $10.0 million milestone payment in April 2015, but as this agreement was terminated in December 2015, we will not generate any additional revenue under this agreement.\nOur ability to generate additional revenue and become profitable depends upon our ability to, among other things, expand the marketing of SPRIX Nasal Spray, OXAYDO and ARYMO ER and any other products that we may develop, in-license or acquire in the future. Further, even if we are able to partner our product candidates and we decide to seek and are able to successfully achieve regulatory approval for them, we do not know when any of these products will generate revenue for us, if at all. Our ability to generate revenue from our products or any partnered product candidates also depends on a number of additional factors, including our ability to:\n\u00b7\nsuccessfully satisfy any FDA post-marketing requirements for OXAYDO and ARYMO ER, including studies and clinical trials that have been required for other immediate release and extended release/long acting opioid analgesics and individual studies and clinical trials of ARYMO ER;\n\u00b7\nsuccessfully complete any necessary clinical studies and human abuse liability studies;\n\u00b7\nSuccessfully maintain all regulatory filings and labels for our products;\n\u00b7\ncomplete and submit NDAs to the FDA and obtain regulatory approval for indications for which there is a commercial market;\n\u00b7\nappropriately address generic entry into the markets for our products;\n\u00b7\nset a commercially viable price for our products;\n\u00b7\nobtain and maintain coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors, including government payors;\n\u00b7\naddress limitations in our marketing ability as a result of the claims that we are permitted to include in the label for our products, including claims regarding abuse deterrence;\n\u00b7\nfurther penetrate the market for existing products and ultimately increase sales for our products relative to our competition;\n\u00b7\nfind suitable partners to help us market, sell and distribute our products, including in other markets;\n\u00b7\nmaintain our intellectual property rights and defend our intellectual property rights from any challenges;\n\u00b7\nobtain commercial quantities of our products at acceptable cost levels;\n\u00b7\ncontinue to develop and/or reconfigure a commercial organization capable of sales, marketing and distribution for the products we intend to sell ourselves in the markets in which we have retained commercialization rights;\n\u00b7\nobtain FDA approval for additional dosage strengths and new abuse-deterrent claims for OXAYDO;\n\u00b7\nfind suitable partners to help us to develop and seek regulatory approval for our product candidates; and\n\u00b7\ncomplete and submit applications to, and obtain regulatory approval from, foreign regulatory authorities.\nIn addition, our commercial infrastructure results in significant expenses. To manage operations effectively, we will need to continue to improve our operational and management controls, reporting and information technology systems and financial internal control procedures. If we are unable to manage our operations effectively, it may be difficult for us to execute our business strategy and our operating results and business could suffer. Any failure by us to manage our operations effectively could have an adverse effect on our ability to achieve our goals.\nFurther, because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development and clinical studies required to achieve additional claims or dosage strengths for our existing products, including that our product candidates may not advance through development or our products or product candidates may not achieve the endpoints of applicable clinical trials, we are unable to predict the timing or amount of increased expenses, or when or if we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. Even if we are able to complete the process described above, we anticipate incurring significant costs associated with commercializing these products.\nEven if we are able to generate meaningful revenues from the sale of our products, we may not become profitable and may need to obtain additional funding to continue operations. If we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels, need to license or abandon one or more of our products and/or be forced to reduce our operations.\nOur current significant indebtedness and any future debt obligations expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition and may result in further dilution to our shareholders.\nIn April 2015, we completed an offering of $61.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.50% convertible senior notes due 2020, or the 5.50% Notes. Interest on the 5.50% Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year, commencing in October 2015, and the 5.50% Notes mature on April 1, 2020. In addition, in August 2016, we completed the initial closing of our offering of up to $80.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 13% senior secured notes, or our Senior Secured Notes. We issued $40.0 million aggregate principal amount of our Senior Secured Notes at the initial closing, and an additional $40.0 million aggregate principal amount of our Senior Secured Notes in January 2017. Interest on our Senior Secured Notes accrues at a rate of 13% per annum and is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 20th and September 20th of each year. On each such payment date, we will also pay an installment of principal on the Senior Secured Notes in an amount equal to 15% (or 17% if certain sales targets are not met) of the aggregate net sales of OXAYDO, SPRIX Nasal Spray, ARYMO ER and Egalet-002 for the two-consecutive fiscal quarterly period most recently ended, less the amount of interest paid on the Senior Secured Notes on that payment date. The Senior Secured Notes mature on September 20, 2033. On December 20, 2017, we entered into exchange agreements with certain holders of our outstanding 5.50% Notes. Holders of, in the aggregate, approximately $36.4 million of outstanding principal amount of the 5.50% Notes agreed to exchange those notes for, in the aggregate, (i) approximately $23.9 million of 6.50% convertible senior notes due 2024 (\u2018\u20186.50% Notes\u2019\u2019), (ii) a warrant exercisable for 3.5 million shares of our Common Stock and (iii) payments, in cash, of all accrued but unpaid interest as of the closing on the 5.50% Notes exchanged in the transaction (the \u201cExchange\u201d). Interest is payable semiannually in arrears on January 1 and July 1 of each year commencing on July 1, 2018 and the 6.50% notes mature December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2017, our total consolidated indebtedness was approximately $128.5 million\nOur ability to make payments on the 5.50% Notes, the 6.50% Notes and the Senior Secured Notes depends on our ability to generate cash in the future. We expect to experience negative cash flow for the foreseeable future as we fund our operations and capital expenditures. There can be no assurance that we will be in a position to repay this indebtedness when due or obtain extensions of the maturity dates. We anticipate that we will need to secure additional funding in order for us to be able to satisfy our obligations when due. For example, on February 28, 2018 the closing price of our common stock was $0.75, which is significantly less than the mandatory conversion price under the indenture governing the 5.50% Notes. If the remaining outstanding 5.50% Notes were to mature while our stock price remains \u201cunderwater,\u201d we would be required to repay the principal amount in cash. We cannot guarantee that future financing will be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nWhen we issued the 6.50% Notes in the Exchange, we were required to reserve for issuance 20,593,103 shares of our common stock, which, if issued, would dilute the stock ownership of our current equity holders. If any additional funding involves the sale of equity securities or convertible securities, it would result in the issuance of additional shares of our capital stock, which would result in dilution to our stockholders. In addition, the indebtedness under the Senior Secured Notes is secured by substantially all of our assets, including our intellectual property. As a result, a default under the Senior Secured Notes indenture could result in the loss of some or all of our assets and intellectual property, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Further, the indentures governing the 5.50% Notes, the 6.50% Notes and the Senior Secured Notes also contain certain customary covenants that limit or restrict our ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness or repay existing indebtedness, grant any security interests, pay cash dividends, repurchase our common stock, make loans, or enter into certain transactions without prior consent. If we are delisted from the Nasdaq Global Market, we could be required to repay the holders of our 5.50% Notes in cash and if we are not able to obtain or maintain listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market, we could be required to repay the holders of our 6.50% Notes in cash. The terms of the agreements governing any of our future indebtedness may have similar or additional limitations and restrictions.\nThis level of debt could have important consequences to you as an investor in our securities. For example, it could:\n\u00b7\nlimit our flexibility in planning for and executing the further development, clinical testing, approval and marketing of our products or product candidates, if successfully partnered;\n\u00b7\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to any of our competitors that are less leveraged than we are;\n\u00b7\nreduce the amount of funds available to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;\n\u00b7\nincrease our vulnerability to both general and industry-specific adverse economic conditions;\n\u00b7\nlimit our ability to engage in acquisitions or other business development activities; and\n\u00b7\nlimit our ability to obtain additional funds.\nIn addition, as the magnitude of our principal and interest payments on the Senior Secured Notes will be proportionate to the revenues generated by our products, the nature of the Senior Secured Notes will reduce the amount of cash flow from net product sales that is available for other corporate purposes.\nSee \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d for a more detailed discussion of the 5.50% Notes, the 6.50% Notes and the Senior Secured Notes.\nServicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness, including the remaining 5.50% Notes, the 6.50% Notes and the Senior Secured Notes, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations. Further, the indentures governing our 5.50% Notes, 6.50% Notes and Senior Secured\nNotes each contain cross-default provisions which could be triggered in the event of a default under any one indenture, which would adversely impact our cash flow and financial condition.\nIn addition, certain provisions in our outstanding notes could require accelerated payment of principal and interest. For example, our 5.50% Notes, of which $24.6 million remain outstanding after the Exchange, provide that the delisting of our Common Stock from the Nasdaq Global Market would constitute a \u201cfundamental change\u201d under the 5.50% Notes, which would entitle each holder, at the holder\u2019s option, to require us to repurchase for cash all or any portion of such holder\u2019s 5.50% Notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon. On November 24, 2017, we received a notice from The Nasdaq Stock Market (\"Nasdaq\") that we were not in compliance with Nasdaq's Listing Rule 5450(b)(2)(A) (the \"Rule\"), as the minimum market value of our Common Stock had been below $50 million for 30 consecutive business days. Further, on March 8, 2018, we received a notice from Nasdaq that since the minimum closing bid price for our Common Stock had been below $1.00 for 30 consecutive business days, we did not meet the minimum closing bid price requirement in the Rule.\nFurther, if we were to be delisted from the Nasdaq Global Market and are unable to qualify for or maintain listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market because our minimum market value of our Common Stock is below $35 million or our minimum closing bid price is below $1.00, in each case for 30 consecutive business days (or otherwise), a complete delisting from Nasdaq would qualify as a \u201cfundamental change\u201d under our 6.50% Notes, which would entitle the holder, at the holder\u2019s option, to require us to repurchase for cash all or any portion of such holder\u2019s 6.50% Notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof. See \u201cRisks Related to Ownership of Our Securities -- We may fail to qualify for continued listing on The NASDAQ Global Market which could make it more difficult for our stockholders to sell their shares\u201d\nIf our common stock is ultimately delisted from the Nasdaq Global Market and we are required to pay the outstanding principal and interest on the 5.50% Notes at that time, or if our Common Stock is ultimately delisted from Nasdaq entirely, and we are required to, in addition, pay the outstanding principal and interest on the 6.50% Notes at that time, our financial condition would be adversely affected. In addition, the indenture governing our Senior Secured Notes limits our ability, and in some cases prohibits us, from making unscheduled payments on subordinated indebtedness, including the 5.50% Notes and the 6.50% Notes. To the extent that we are unable to make such a payment in accordance with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, it could result in a default under that document and/or other adverse consequences.\nIf we are unable to refinance our remaining 5.50% Notes or if we are delisted from Nasdaq, our cash flow and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nAlthough we recently completed the Exchange and were able to refinance $36.4 million of the previously outstanding $61 million principal amount of our 5.50% Notes, $24.6 million of our 5.50% Notes remain outstanding and if not refinanced, will mature on April 1, 2020. In addition, as noted above, if we are unable to regain compliance with the Rule, we could be delisted from the Nasdaq Global Market and such delisting would enable the holders of the remaining $24.6 million principal amount of 5.50% Notes to require us to repurchase for cash all or any portion of such holder\u2019s 5.50% Notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon. Such a large cash outlay would deplete our cash reserves and negatively impact our ability to fund our operations, including as a result of limitations contained in the indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes. If we are unable to refinance the 5.50% Notes, we could be forced to pay off the 5.50% Notes prior to their maturity, which would adversely impact our cash flow and financial condition. Further, if we are delisted from the Nasdaq Global Market and are not eligible for listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market because we are unable to satisfy the market value of listed securities standard and/or the equity standard, the \u201cfundamental change\u201d provision under the 6.50% Notes would be triggered and the holders of our 6.50% Notes would have the right to require us to repurchase for cash prior to maturity all or a portion of such holder\u2019s 6.50% Notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof. This would also adversely impact our cash flow and financial condition and, in certain circumstances, could result in a default under our Senior Secured Notes, which would have a material adverse effect on us and could result in our seeking bankruptcy protection.\nThe report of our independent registered public accounting firm contains explanatory language that substantial doubt exists about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe report of our independent registered public accounting firm on our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017 contains explanatory language that substantial doubt exists about our ability to continue as a going concern. As noted, our outstanding convertible notes contain redemption features in the event we are not able to maintain our Nasdaq listing. We continue to seek other sources of capital and alternatives to maintain our listing on the Nasdaq, but if we are unable to obtain sufficient financing to support and complete these activities, then we would, in all likelihood, experience severe liquidity problems and may have to curtail our operations. In addition, volatility in the capital markets may be a significant obstacle to raising the required funds. If we curtail our operations, we may be placed into bankruptcy or undergo liquidation, the result of which will adversely affect the value of our common shares.\nThe consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. If the going concern basis were not appropriate for these financial statements, adjustments would be necessary in the carrying value of assets and liabilities, the reported expenses and the balance sheet classifications used.\nBased on our current operating plan, if we are able to gain compliance with the continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq and avoid a delisting and a put right under our 5.50% Notes and 6.50% Notes, we estimate that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2017 will enable us to fund our cash requirements into 2020.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $91.0 million. We estimate that this amount will be sufficient to fund our cash requirements into 2020, assuming, among other assumptions, that our stock remains listed on Nasdaq. If we do not maintain compliance with Nasdaq listing requirements, there may be doubt that we can continue as a going concern, or we may be forced to sell our company or our assets, cease or wind down operations, seek protection under the provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, or otherwise liquidate and dissolve our company.\nOur forecast of the period through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward-looking statement and involves assumptions, risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors, including the factors discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-K. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect, and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect or we could determine earlier that a sale of our company or our assets, petition for relief under the provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, or other liquidation or dissolution of our company is warranted.\nIf we require additional capital to fund our operations and we fail to obtain necessary financing, we may be unable to successfully market and promote our products, acquire new products or enhance the profiles of our products.\nOur operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since inception. We expect to continue to spend substantial amounts to commercialize our products, as well as to enhance the profiles of our products\nWe cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of one or more of our products or one or more of our other research and development initiatives or delay our ability to acquire or license new products or product candidates. We also could fail to complete our post-marketing requirements, fail to maintain our regulatory approvals or our intellectual property or be required to further curtail our operations, including by discontinuing the sale of one or more of our products.\nOur forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward-looking statement and involves risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors, including the factors discussed elsewhere in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we\ncurrently expect. Our future funding requirements, both near and long-term, will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u00b7\nincreasing sales of our products;\n\u00b7\ncomplying with and completing FDA post-marketing requirements on OXAYDO and ARYMO ER and PREA commitment for SPRIX Nasal Spray;\n\u00b7\nthe initiation, progress, timing, costs and results of clinical trials for our products and any future products we may in-license or acquire;\n\u00b7\nany generic entry into one or more of the markets for our products;\n\u00b7\nthe ability to obtain abuse-deterrent claims in the labels for our products;\n\u00b7\nthe number and characteristics of products, any partnered product candidates, and any products that we in-license or acquire;\n\u00b7\nthe outcome, timing and cost of regulatory approvals by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, including the potential for the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities to require that we perform more studies than those that we currently expect;\n\u00b7\nour ability to maintain regulatory approvals by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities once obtained;\n\u00b7\nour ability to obtain API through the allocation process handled by the DEA;\n\u00b7\nthe cost of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights;\n\u00b7\nthe effect of competing technological and market developments, including pressure on the opioid market and the expected decline in the prescribing of opioids;\n\u00b7\nthe cost and timing of completion of commercial-scale outsourced manufacturing activities for any products we develop, in-license or acquire;\n\u00b7\nthe timing and amount of revenue from sales of our products;\n\u00b7\nour ability to achieve milestones under any license or collaboration agreement that we have entered or may enter into in the future;\n\u00b7\nthe size and cost of our commercial infrastructure;\n\u00b7\nour ability to maintain coverage and adequate reimbursements from third party payors and to gain inclusion on applicable formularies;\n\u00b7\nour ability to continue to be listed on the Nasdaq Global Market;\n\u00b7\ncosts and timing of completion of any outsourced commercial manufacturing supply arrangements that we may establish; and\n\u00b7\ncosts associated with any third-party litigation.\nDespite our current debt levels, we may still incur additional debt or take other actions which would intensify the risks discussed above.\nDespite our current consolidated debt levels, we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur certain additional debt in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in our debt instruments, some of which may be secured debt. In certain situations, the terms of the indentures governing the 5.50% Notes, 6.50% Notes and Senior Secured Notes permit us to incur additional debt, secure existing or future debt, recapitalize our debt or take a number of other actions that could have the effect of diminishing our ability to make payments on our existing debt when due. The indenture governing our Senior Secured Notes restricts our ability to incur certain additional indebtedness, including certain secured indebtedness, subject to certain exceptions, but if the Senior Secured Notes mature or are repaid, we may not be subject to such restrictions under the terms of any subsequent indebtedness.\nOur recently-issued warrants to purchase our Common Stock contain anti-dilution and other provisions which may affect our ability to secure future equity financing or reduce the proceeds of any equity financing that would otherwise be available to us.\nIn our July 2017 equity offering, we sold our Common Stock and warrants to purchase our Common Stock. The warrants contain anti-dilution provisions, which provide that any new issuances of Common Stock or securities convertible into Common Stock at a price, exercise price or conversion price below those of the warrants will result in the exercise price of the warrants being reduced based upon the number of securities issues in such issuance and the number of shares of our Common Stock then outstanding. For example, we were required to reduce the conversion price of our outstanding warrants twice (from an initial conversion price of $2.70 to a final conversion price of $2.14) due to sales or later issuances of our Common Stock (or securities convertible into our Common Stock) at lower prices. In addition, the warrants prohibit the Company from entering into \u201cVariable Rate Transactions\u201d (as defined in the warrant) which are defined generally to include issuances of securities exercisable or convertible into the Company\u2019s common stock at an exercise or conversion price that is not determinable at the time of such original issuance.\nThese anti-dilution and other provisions may affect our ability to secure future equity financing or reduce the proceeds of any equity financings that would be otherwise available to us.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies, products or product candidates.\nWe may seek additional capital through a combination of private and public equity offerings, debt financings, receivables or royalty financings, strategic partnerships and alliances and licensing arrangements. We do not currently have any committed external sources of funds. Moreover, our existing debt places significant limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of existing stockholders. Debt, receivables and royalty financings may be coupled with an equity component, such as warrants to purchase stock, which could also result in dilution of our existing stockholders\u2019 ownership. For example, our 5.50% Notes and 6.50% Notes are, subject to certain conditions, convertible into shares of our common stock at the option of the debt holder. The incurrence of additional indebtedness would result in increased fixed payment obligations and could also result in certain additional restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business and may result in liens being placed on our assets and intellectual property. If we were to default on such indebtedness, we could lose such assets and intellectual property. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financing when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or commercialization efforts, otherwise significantly curtail operations or grant rights to develop and market our technologies that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves. If we raise additional funds through strategic partnerships and alliances and licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our product candidates, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.\nRisks Related to the Commercialization of Our Products\nOur products are and may become subject to unfavorable pricing regulations, third-party reimbursement practices or healthcare reform initiatives, which could harm our business.\nThe regulations that govern marketing approvals, pricing and reimbursement for new drug products vary widely from country to country. Current and future legislation may significantly change the approval requirements in ways that could involve additional costs and cause delays in obtaining approvals. For example, recent events have resulted in increased public and governmental scrutiny of the cost of drugs, especially in connection with price increases following companies\u2019 acquisitions of the rights to certain drug products. In particular, the U.S. Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee recently held hearings aimed at understanding drug pricing issues, which involved testimony from drug, pharmacy, and distribution groups. While no decisions resulted from the hearings, the hearings demonstrate the continued focus of the U.S. Congress on pricing issues. Our revenue and future profitability could be negatively affected if these inquiries were to result in legislative or regulatory proposals that limit our ability to increase the prices of our products. Further, legislation has been introduced in the U.S. Congress and several state legislatures that allows price controls in various circumstances, requires enhanced transparency in how pricing is established, caps or penalizes price inflation beyond certain parameters and ties pricing to federal supply schedules, among other initiatives. Some countries require approval of the sale price of a drug before it can be marketed. In many countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing or product licensing approval is granted. In some foreign markets, prescription pharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even after initial approval is granted. As a result, we or our collaborator might obtain marketing approval for a product in a particular country, but then be subject to price regulations that delay our commercial launch of the product, possibly for lengthy time periods, which could negatively impact the revenues we are able to generate from the sale of the product in that particular country. Adverse pricing limitations may hinder our ability to recoup our investment in one or more of our products.\nOur ability to commercialize our products, including any products we may in-license or acquire, successfully will also depend in part on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers, pharmacy benefit managers and other organizations. Government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, determine which medications they will cover and establish reimbursement levels. A primary trend in the United States healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and other third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications. Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. For example, in late 2017, we were notified by CVS Caremark, a pharmacy benefits manager, that SPRIX Nasal Spray would no longer be on its formulary for a portion of its commercial covered lives beginning January 1, 2018, which will have an adverse effect on our revenues. We cannot be sure that coverage and reimbursement will be available for our products, or any product that we commercialize, or that we will obtain such coverage and reimbursement in a timely fashion. For example, because the majority of patients taking morphine are government insured, and gaining government coverage is typically a lengthy process, we could face commercial challenges in gaining coverage for ARYMO ER. Assuming we obtain coverage for a given product, the resulting reimbursement payment rates might not be adequate or may require co-payments that patients find unacceptably high. Patients are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products. Coverage and reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, any of our products. If coverage and reimbursement are not available or reimbursement is available only to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our products. In addition, when we seek coverage for our products, we may be requested to submit bids that include all three of our products for consideration at the same time, which could result in demand for and agreement to higher rebates on one or more of our products than would occur if each were bid in isolation.\nThere may be significant delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly-approved drugs, and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the drug is approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Moreover, eligibility for coverage and reimbursement does not imply that any drug will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution. Interim reimbursement levels for new drugs, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover our costs and may only be\ntemporary. Reimbursement rates may vary according to the use of the drug and the clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on reimbursement levels already set for lower cost drugs and may be incorporated into existing payments for other services. Net prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private third-party payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. Private third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement policies. Our inability to promptly obtain coverage and profitable reimbursement rates from both government-funded and private payors for our products could hamper our ability to generate widespread prescription demand and would have a material adverse effect on our operating results, our ability to raise capital and our overall financial condition.\nIf physicians and patients do not accept and use our products, we will not achieve sufficient product revenues and our business will suffer.\nIf our products do not achieve coverage by third-party payors and/or broad market acceptance by physicians and patients, the commercial success of those products and revenues that we generate from those products will be limited. Acceptance and use of our products will depend on a number of factors including:\n\u00b7\nthe timing of market introduction of competitive products;\n\u00b7\nthe ability to obtain abuse-deterrent claims in the labels for our products at all, and broad enough abuse-deterrent claims that encompass common forms of abuse to demonstrate a substantial benefit to health care providers and patients;\n\u00b7\nany exclusivity rights a competitor\u2019s products may have;\n\u00b7\nthe results of any required Phase 4 studies following any product approval to support the continued use of any abuse-deterrent claims;\n\u00b7\napproved indications, warnings and precautions language that may be less desirable than anticipated;\n\u00b7\nperceptions by members of the healthcare community, including physicians, about the safety and efficacy of our products and, in particular, the efficacy of our abuse-deterrent technology in reducing potential risks of unintended use;\n\u00b7\npublished studies demonstrating the cost effectiveness of our products relative to competing products;\n\u00b7\nthe potential and perceived advantages of our products and product candidates over alternative treatments;\n\u00b7\navailability of coverage and adequate reimbursement for our products from government and third-party payors;\n\u00b7\nthe steps that prescribers and dispensers must take, since our products are controlled substances, as well as the perceived risks based upon their controlled substance status;\n\u00b7\nany negative publicity related to our or our competitors\u2019 products that include the same active ingredient as our products;\n\u00b7\nthe prevalence and severity of adverse side effects, including limitations or warnings contained in a product\u2019s FDA approved product labeling;\n\u00b7\nlegislative, regulatory or administrative enforcement actions against opioid manufacturers;\n\u00b7\nany quality issue that may arise in the manufacturing or distribution of our products; and\n\u00b7\neffectiveness of marketing and distribution efforts by us and other licensees and distributors.\nBecause we expect to rely on sales generated by our products to achieve profitability in the future, the failure of our products to achieve market acceptance would harm our business prospects.\nOur future prospects are dependent on the success of our products, and we may not be able to successfully commercialize these products. Failure to do so would adversely impact our financial condition and prospects.\nA substantial portion of our resources are focused on the commercialization of our products, OXAYDO, SPRIX Nasal Spray and ARYMO ER. Our ability to generate significant product revenues and to achieve commercial success in the near-term will initially depend in large part on our ability to successfully commercialize these products in the United States. If we fail to successfully commercialize our current and future products, we may be unable to generate sufficient revenues to sustain and grow our business, and our business, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nOur limited history of commercial operations makes evaluating our business and future prospects difficult, and may increase the risk of any investment in our shares.\nFollowing our acquisition and license in January 2015 of SPRIX Nasal Spray and OXAYDO, respectively, and the approval by the FDA of ARYMO ER in January 2017, we have three products approved in the United States. However, we have a limited history of marketing these products. We began the commercial activities for OXYADO in the United States in the third quarter of 2015 and for ARYMO ER in the first quarter of 2017. SPRIX Nasal Spray has remained commercially available in the United States following our acquisition of the product on January 8, 2015. To date, sales of our marketed products, while growing, have not been significant, particularly as compared to the costs associated with the commercial infrastructure we have created and the commercialization efforts we have undertaken. We face considerable risks and difficulties as a company with limited commercial operating history. If we do not successfully address these risks, our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition will be materially and adversely harmed. Our limited commercial operating history, including our limited history commercializing SPRIX Nasal Spray, OXAYDO and ARYMO ER, makes it particularly difficult for us to predict our future operating results and appropriately budget for our expenses. In the event that actual results differ from our estimates or we adjust our estimates in future periods, our operating results and financial position could be materially affected.\nWe are a small company with limited sales, marketing and market access capabilities and, if we are unable to effectively utilize our sales, marketing and market access resources or enter into strategic alliances with collaborators, we may not be successful in commercializing our products or any products that we may in-license or acquire.\nWe have limited sales, marketing, market access and distribution capabilities compared to some of our competitors. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in marketing our products or any products that we may in license or acquire in the United States. Factors that may inhibit our efforts to commercialize our product candidates in the United States include:\n\u00b7\nour inability to recruit and retain adequate numbers of effective sales, marketing and market access personnel;\n\u00b7\nthe inability of sales personnel to obtain access to or persuade adequate numbers of physicians to prescribe our products over competitive products; and\n\u00b7\nthe lack of complementary products to be offered by sales personnel, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies with more extensive product lines; and\n\u00b7\nour inability to secure formulary coverage that provides broad product access.\nIf we are not successful in effectively deploying our limited sales, marketing and market access capabilities or if we do not successfully enter into appropriate collaboration arrangements, we will have difficulty commercializing our products or any products that we may in-license or acquire. Outside the United States, where we intend to commercialize our products by entering into agreements with third-party collaborators, we may have limited or no control over the sales, marketing and distribution activities of these third parties, in which case our future revenues would depend heavily on the success of the efforts of these third parties.\nIf we are unable to recruit, retain and effectively train qualified sales personnel, our performance could suffer.\nWhile we compete with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, many of those companies are larger or have more resources, to recruit, hire, train and retain qualified sales personnel. If we are not successful in continuing to recruit and retain sales personnel, we may not be successful in commercializing our products or any products that we may in-license or acquire. Further, we will need to provide our salesforce with the quality training, support, guidance and oversight, including with respect to compliance with applicable law, in order for them to be credible and effective. If we fail to perform these commercial functions, our products may not achieve their maximum commercial potential or any significant level of success at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, share price and operations. The deterioration or loss of our salesforce would materially and adversely impact our ability to generate sales revenue, which would hurt our results of operations.\nIf we fail to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals, or if such approvals are limited, we will not be able to fully commercialize our products and our financial performance could suffer.\nWe have and will submit supplemental applications to the FDA for our products. The FDA may not approve supplemental applications we make to add dosage strengths for our products or to strengthen the labels for our products with additional labeling claims, including claims regarding abuse deterrence, which we believe are necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of our products and product candidates. The FDA could also decide that any approval would require us to perform additional clinical studies, which could be costly. For example, in June 2017, we received a complete response letter from the FDA regarding the prior approval supplement of OXAYDO in 10 mg and 15 mg dosage strengths in which the FDA requested more information regarding the effect of food on OXAYDO 15 mg and the intranasal abuse-deterrent properties of OXAYDO 10 mg and 15 mg. In addition, we filed an sNDA with the FDA in December 2016 based on Category 1 AD data that demonstrated that OXAYDO resists syringeability, which could potentially deter abuse through the intravenous route. Based on discussions with the FDA regarding the sNDA, we believe a contemporary intranasal HAP study would be needed to complete the sNDA. Given that the issues involved in both the sNDA and prior approval supplement are intertwined, we are evaluating our options and the costs associated to proceed on the AD label and/or the additional dosage strengths.\nFurther, later discovery of previously unknown problems or adverse events could result in additional regulatory restrictions, including withdrawal of products if the benefits of such products do not outweigh the risks. The FDA may also require us to perform lengthy Phase 4 post-approval clinical efficacy or safety trials. These trials could be very expensive. The FDA may also require us to amend our labels based on outcomes of on-going Phase 4 commitments for OXAYDO and ARYMO ER. Addressing these regulatory issues, if any, may impact the commercial availability of these products, which could have an adverse effect on our financial performance.\nOur ability to market and promote our products in the United States by describing their abuse-deterrent features will be determined by the FDA-approved label for them.\nThe commercial success of certain of our products will depend upon our ability to obtain FDA approved labeling describing their abuse-deterrent features or benefits or to strengthen our FDA approved labeling. Our failure to achieve FDA approval of product labeling containing such information, or containing such information for all potential routes of abuse, will prevent or substantially limit our advertising and promotion of the abuse-deterrent features of our products to differentiate them from other opioid products containing the same active ingredients. This may make certain of our products less competitive in the market.\nThe FDA has publicly stated that explicit claims that a product is expected to result in a meaningful reduction of abuse must be supported by randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical studies of the abuse potential of the drug and that explicit claims that a product has demonstrated reduced abuse in the community will be required to be supported by post-marketing data, including formal post-marketing studies evaluating the effect of abuse-deterrent formulations. In addition, recent FDA advisory committee meetings have highlighted the FDA\u2019s desire that newly approved abuse-deterrent products be supported by studies with regard to all routes of abuse. If the FDA does not approve labeling containing such information, we will not be able to promote such products based on some or all of their abuse-deterrent features, may not be able to differentiate such products from other opioid products containing the same active ingredients. For example, in January 2017, the FDA approved abuse-deterrent labeling for ARYMO ER for the intravenous route of abuse, but did not approve the inclusion of abuse-deterrent claims for the oral and intranasal routes of abuse. The intranasal abuse-deterrent claim was blocked by another company\u2019s exclusivity.\nIn addition, recent public comments from FDA and members of Congress have highlighted the importance of addressing the opioid abuse epidemic. Given the changing legislative and regulatory environment, it is difficult to predict how existing laws and regulations may affect the future approval and continued marketing of opioids, including those that fulfill current abuse-deterrent FDA guidance. For example, the FDA granted tentative approval for a supplement we submitted in early 2017 to update the ARYMO ER prescribing information with data from a Category 2/3 intranasal HAP study and an intranasal abuse-deterrent claim, which was excluded from the label at the time of the original new drug application (NDA) approval due to exclusivity granted to another company. Although we expect to receive final approval when the exclusivity period expires on October 2, 2018, given the dynamic political environment related to opioids, the FDA could change its position once the exclusivity period has passed. Further, based on discussions with the FDA regarding a sNDA we filed for OXAYDO to support an abuse-deterrent label claim for the intravenous route of abuse, we believe a contemporary intranasal HAP study would be needed to complete the sNDA. If we are unable to obtain an abuse-deterrent claim for OXAYDO, the commercial opportunity for OXAYDO could be adversely impacted.\nBecause the FDA closely regulates promotional materials and other promotional activities, even if the FDA initially approves product labeling that includes a description of the abuse-deterrent characteristics of our product, the FDA may object to our marketing claims and product advertising campaigns. This could lead to the issuance of warning letters or untitled letters, suspension or withdrawal of our products from the market, recalls, fines, disgorgement of money, operating restrictions, injunctions or criminal prosecution. Any of these consequences would harm the commercial success of our products.\nWe may not be able to obtain three-year FDA regulatory exclusivity for certain aspects of our products and if partnered and approved, our product candidates.\nUnder certain circumstances, the FDA provides periods of regulatory exclusivity following its approval of an NDA, which provide the holder of an approved NDA limited protection from new competition in the marketplace for the innovation represented by its approved drug. Three-year exclusivity is available to the holder of an NDA, including a 505(b)(2) NDA, for a particular condition of approval, or change to a marketed product, such as a new formulation or new labeling information for a previously approved product, if one or more new clinical trials, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence trials, were essential to the approval of the application and were conducted or sponsored by the applicant.\nThere is a risk that the FDA may take the view that the studies that we are conducting are not clinical trials, other than bioavailability and bioequivalence studies, that are essential to approval and therefore do not support three-year exclusivity. Further, the FDA may decide that any exclusivity is limited (such as to a particular formulation) and does not block approval of subsequent applications for competing products that differ in certain respects from our product. Finally, to the extent that the basis for exclusivity is not clear, the FDA may determine to defer a decision until it receives an application which necessitates a decision.\nIf we do obtain three years of exclusivity, such exclusivity will not block all potential competitors from the market. Competitors may be able to obtain approval for similar products with different forms of abuse-deterrent mechanisms or may be able to obtain approval for similar products without an abuse-deterrent mechanism.\nWe face intense competition, including from generic products. If our competitors market or develop generic versions of our products or alternative treatments that are marketed more effectively than our products or are demonstrated to be safer or more effective than our products, our commercial opportunities will be reduced or eliminated.\nOur products compete against numerous branded and generic products already being marketed and potentially those that are or will be in development. Many of these competitive products are offered in the United States by large, well-capitalized companies.\nIf the FDA or other applicable regulatory authorities approve generic products that compete with any of our products, including generic products with abuse-deterrent claims, it could reduce our sales of those product. Once an NDA, including a Section 505(b)(2) application, is approved, the product covered thereby becomes a \u201clisted drug\u201d which can, in turn, be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application (\u201cANDA\u201d). The FFDCA, FDA regulations and other applicable regulations and policies provide incentives to manufacturers to create modified, non-infringing versions of a drug to facilitate the approval of an ANDA or other application for generic substitutes. Depending on the product, these manufacturers might only be required to conduct a relatively inexpensive study to show that their product has the same active ingredient(s), dosage form, strength, route of administration, and conditions of use, or labeling, as our product candidate and that the generic product is absorbed in the body at the same rate and to the same extent as, or is bioequivalent to, our products. Generic equivalents may be significantly less costly than ours to bring to market and companies that produce generic equivalents are often able to offer their products at lower prices. Thus, after the introduction of a generic competitor, a significant percentage of the sales of any branded product are typically lost to the generic product. Accordingly, competition from generic equivalents to our products would substantially limit our ability to generate revenues and therefore to obtain a return on the investments we have made in our products and product candidates. For example, the patent for SPRIX Nasal Spray expires in December 2018; however, we are a party to agreements that permit the potential launch of generics in March 2018. We cannot be certain what impact generic products would have on our revenues from SPRIX Nasal Spray, or our operating results generally. In addition, on February 23, 2018, we received notice from Teva that Teva has submitted an ANDA with the FDA seeking regulatory approval to market a generic version of ARYMO ER. The notice from Teva included a \u201cParagraph IV certification\u201d with respect to two of our Orange Book-listed patents, alleging that the patents are invalid, unenforceable and/or will not be infringed by the commercial manufacture, use or sale of Teva\u2019s proposed generic product. Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, we have 45 days from receipt of the notice to determine if we will file a patent infringement suit. If we do bring such a suit, a stay of approval will be imposed by the FDA on Teva\u2019s ANDA for the earlier of 30 months or a decision in the infringement case that each of the patents is invalid or not infringed. We intend to vigorously enforce our intellectual property rights, but cannot predict the outcome of this matter.\nOur competitors may also develop products that are more effective, more abuse-deterrent, better tolerated, subject to fewer or less severe side effects, more useful, more widely-prescribed or accepted, or less costly than ours. For each product we commercialize, sales and marketing efficiency are likely to be significant competitive factors. While we have our own internal salesforce, which markets our products in the United States, there can be no assurance that we can maintain these capabilities in a manner that will be cost efficient and competitive with the sales and marketing efforts of our competitors, especially since some or all of those competitors could expend greater economic resources than we do and/or employ third-party sales and marketing channels.\nOur products may be associated with undesirable adverse reactions or result in significant negative consequences.\nUndesirable adverse reactions associated with our products could cause us, our institutional review boards, clinical trial sites or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in a restrictive product label or the delay, denial or withdrawal of regulatory approval by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities.\nIf we or others identify undesirable adverse events associated with any of our products a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:\n\u00b7\nwe may have to significantly alter our promotional campaigns or activities or we may be forced to suspend marketing of the product entirely;\n\u00b7\nregulatory authorities may withdraw their approvals of the product or impose restrictions on its distribution;\n\u00b7\nregulatory authorities may require additional warnings or contradictions in the product label that could diminish the usage or otherwise limit the commercial success of the product;\n\u00b7\nwe may be required to conduct additional post-marketing studies;\n\u00b7\nwe could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients; and\n\u00b7\nour reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of our products and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nRecently enacted and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for us to commercialize our product candidates, may reduce the prices we are able to obtain for our products and our product candidates and hinder or prevent the commercial success.\nBefore we can market and sell products in a particular jurisdiction, we need to obtain necessary regulatory approvals (from the FDA in the United States and from similar foreign regulatory agencies in other jurisdictions) and in some jurisdictions, reimbursement authorization. There are no guarantees that we or our commercialization partners will obtain any additional regulatory approvals for our products. Even if we or our commercialization partners obtain or maintain all of the necessary regulatory approvals, we may never generate significant revenues from any commercial sales of our products.\nIn the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of any product candidates we are able to partner, restrict or regulate post-approval activities or affect our ability to profitably sell our products.\nWhile there have been repeated calls and attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, the Affordable Care Act, among other things, imposes a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug products. It also contains substantial new provisions intended to, among other things, broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of health care spending, enhance remedies against healthcare fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers, modify the definition of \u201caverage manufacturer price\u201d for Medicaid reporting purposes thus affecting manufacturers\u2019 Medicaid drug rebates payable to states and impose additional health policy reforms, any of which could negatively impact our business. A significant number of provisions are not yet, or have only recently become, effective, but the Affordable Care Act is likely to continue the downward pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medicare program, and may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs.\nOther legislative changes have also been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011 resulted in aggregate reductions in Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, starting in 2013, and, due to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, will remain in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken, and the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the\ngovernment to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could impose additional financial pressure on our customers, which could in turn diminish demand for our products or result in pricing pressure on us. In addition, drug pricing by pharmaceutical companies has recently come under close scrutiny. The current administration has indicated that reducing the price of prescription drugs will be a priority of the administration. If healthcare policies or reforms intended to curb healthcare costs are adopted, or if we experience negative publicity with respect to pricing of our products or the pricing of pharmaceutical drugs generally, the prices that we charge for our products may be limited, our commercial opportunity may be limited and/or our revenues from sales of our products may be negatively impacted.\nWe expect that the Affordable Care Act, as well as other healthcare reform measures that have been and may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for our products, and could seriously harm our future revenues. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from third-party payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may compromise our ability to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our products. Any new laws or regulations that have the effect of imposing additional costs or regulatory burden on pharmaceutical manufacturers, or otherwise negatively affect the industry, would adversely affect our ability to successfully commercialize our products.\nLegislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products. We cannot be sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether the FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes may be. In addition, increased scrutiny by the U.S. Congress of the FDA\u2019s approval process may significantly delay or prevent approval of any of our applications, as well as subject us to more stringent product labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements.\nThe 21st Century Cures Act, which the U.S. House of Representatives passed in July 2015 and former President Obama signed into law in December 2016, provides a wide range of reforms, such as broadening the types of data required to support drug approval, extending protections from generic competition, accelerating approval of breakthrough therapies, expanding the orphan drug product program, and clarifying how manufacturers communicate about their products.\nIn addition, state pharmacy laws may permit pharmacists to substitute generic products for branded products if the products are therapeutic equivalents, or may permit pharmacists and pharmacy benefit managers to seek prescriber authorization to substitute generics in place of our product candidates, which could significantly diminish demand for them and significantly impact our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates and generate revenues.\nFurther, various federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives that seek to curtail patient supply of opioids, limit access to products that exceed specific morphine equivalent daily dose thresholds, or curtail or prohibit manufacturers from offering any discounts to enrollees to reduce their out-of-pocket expenses may have a negative impact on us. California recently enacted a law restricting manufacturers from paying co-pays for branded products if an AB-rated generic equivalent is available. While this law does not currently impact our products, California\u2019s law could spur other states to adopt similar legislation, even legislation that is more restrictive. Any such law could adversely impact the utilization of our products and harm our commercial prospects. Although not successful so far, certain states have proposed legislation that would establish a tax on opioids to be paid by the manufacturer could negatively impact our financial condition.\nSocial issues around the abuse of opioids, including law enforcement concerns over diversion of opioid and regulatory efforts to combat abuse, could decrease the potential market for ARYMO ER and OXAYDO.\nMedia stories regarding prescription drug abuse and the diversion of opioids and other controlled substances are commonplace. Law enforcement and regulatory agencies may apply policies that seek to limit the availability of opioids, or remove opioids from the market entirely. Such efforts may inhibit our ability to commercialize ARYMO ER or OXAYDO. Aggressive enforcement and unfavorable publicity regarding, for example, the use or misuse of opioid drugs, the limitations or unintended consequences of abuse-resistant formulations, public inquiries and investigations into\nprescription drug abuse, litigation or regulatory activity relating to sales, marketing (including providing meals to doctors), distribution (including with respect to high prescribers of opioids), or storage of our drug products could harm our reputation. In addition, payments to doctors to participate in speaker programs or payments to industry groups could reflect negatively on us. Such negative publicity could reduce the potential size of the market for ARYMO ER and OXAYDO and decrease the revenues and royalties we are able to generate from their sale. Similarly, to the extent opioid abuse becomes less prevalent or a less urgent public health issue, regulators and third-party payors may not be willing to pay a premium for abuse-deterrent formulations of opioids.\nIn addition, efforts by the FDA and other regulatory bodies to combat abuse of opioids may negatively impact the market for our products. For example, in February 2016, as part of a broader initiative led by HHS to address opioid-related overdose, death and dependence, the FDA released an action plan to address the opioid abuse epidemic and reassess the FDA\u2019s approach to opioid medications. The plan identifies the FDA\u2019s focus on implementing policies to reverse the opioid abuse epidemic, while maintaining access to effective treatments. The actions set forth in the FDA\u2019s plan include strengthening post marketing study requirements to evaluate the benefit of long-term opioid use, changing the REMS requirements to provide additional funding for physician education courses, releasing a draft guidance setting forth approval standards for generic abuse-deterrent opioid formulations, and seeking input from the FDA\u2019s Scientific Board to broaden the understanding of the public risks of opioid abuse. The FDA\u2019s plan is part of a broader initiative led by the HHS to address opioid-related overdose, death and dependence. The HHS initiative\u2019s focus is on improving physician\u2019s use of opioids through education and resources to address opioid over-prescribing, increasing use and development of improved delivery systems for naloxone, which can reverse overdose from both prescription opioids and heroin, to reduce overdose-related deaths, and expanding the use of Medication-Assisted Treatment, which couples counseling and behavioral therapies with medication to address substance abuse. Also, as part of this initiative, the CDC has launched a state grant program to offer state health departments resources to assist with abuse prevention efforts, including efforts to track opioid prescribing through state-run electronic databases. In March 2016, as part of the HHS initiative, the CDC released a Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain. The guideline is intended to assist primary care providers treating adults for chronic pain in outpatient settings. The guideline provides recommendations to improve communications between doctors and patients about the risks and benefits of opioid therapy for chronic pain, improve the safety and effectiveness of pain treatment, and reduce the risks associated with long-term opioid therapy. The guideline states that no treatment recommendations about the use of abuse-deterrent opioids can be made at this time. Many of these changes could require us to expend additional resources on commercializing ARYMO ER and OXAYDO to meet additional requirements. Advancements in the development and approval of generic abuse-deterrent opioids could also compete with and potentially impact physician use of our products and product candidates and cause our products to be less commercially successful.\nThe FDA continues to evaluate extended release and abuse-deterrent opioids in the post-market setting. In March 2017, the FDA\u2019s Advisory Committee met to discuss a competitor company\u2019s abuse-deterrent opioid. A majority of the Advisory Committee voted that the benefits do not outweigh the risks of that competitor company\u2019s product. Upon the FDA\u2019s subsequent request in June 2017, the drug was removed from the market. Also, in July 2017, the FDA held a public workshop to discuss available data and methods to assess the impact of opioid formulations with abuse-deterrent properties on misuse, abuse, addiction, overdose, and death in the post-market context. We expect that the FDA will continue to scrutinize the impact of abuse-deterrent opioids and in the future could impose further restrictions to products currently on the market, which may include changing labeling, imposing additional prescribing restrictions, or seeking a product\u2019s removal from the market, which would have an adverse effect on our financial performance.\nMany states and municipalities, a Native American Tribe and individual consumers have brought lawsuits against manufacturers, pharmacies and distributors of opioids, seeking damages for the costs associated with drug abuse and dependency. We may be brought into actions in the future, which could divert our attention and resources and have an adverse impact on our operations and financial condition.\nSeveral state attorneys general, including Missouri, Ohio, New Hampshire and others, have sued opioid manufacturers, distributors and pharmacies alleging that such parties made false and misleading statements in the promotion of opioids or fueled opioid addition by selling large quantities of opioids in certain areas, resulting in high incidences of opioid overdoses and deaths. The plaintiffs in these cases are seeking to recover costs associated with drug dependency, overdose and death resulting from opioid use. These cases involve our larger competitors and largely relate\nto time periods prior to the time that we first began commercializing OXAYDO, our abuse discouraging immediate release oxycodone, in 2015. However, we could be brought into actions in the future if potential plaintiffs view our promotion of opioids as fueling the social problems with opioids.\nThe U.S. Congress has also been investigating opioid manufacturers. In March 2017, the U.S. Senate began investigating the role that manufacturers may have played in the opioid addiction problem in the U.S. The Senate requested internal documents from five of our large competitors relating to the marketing tactics for opioids and what, if anything, those manufacturers knew about the dangers of those drugs, and indicated that the probe could be expanded to include other manufacturers.\nLitigation involving governmental entities or class actions and governmental investigations are expensive and time consuming. If we were to be sued or investigated over our commercialization of opioids, such an action could divert our attention and resources and have an adverse impact on our operations and financial condition.\nGuidelines and recommendations published by various organizations can reduce the use of our products.\nGovernment agencies promulgate regulations and guidelines directly applicable to us and to our products. Third party payors, professional societies, practice management groups, private health and science foundations and organizations involved in various diseases from time to time may also publish guidelines or recommendations to the healthcare and patient communities. Recommendations of government agencies or these other groups or organizations may relate to such matters as usage, dosage, route of administration and use of concomitant therapies. For example, some governmental and large third-party payors have begun to institute limits on the number of days\u2019 worth of opioid medication a patient can receive for the patient\u2019s first opioid prescription. Recommendations or guidelines suggesting the reduced use of our products or the use of competitive or alternative products as the standard of care to be followed by patients and healthcare providers could result in decreased use of our products.\nIf product liability lawsuits are brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of our products.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability as a result of the commercial sales of our products and the clinical testing of our product candidates. For example, we may be sued if any of our products or product candidates allegedly causes injury or is found to be otherwise unsuitable during clinical testing, manufacturing, marketing or sale. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product, negligence, strict liability or a breach of warranties. Claims could also be asserted under state consumer protection acts. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization of our product candidates. Even a successful defense would require significant financial and management resources. Regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u00b7\ninjury to our reputation;\n\u00b7\ndecreased demand for our products;\n\u00b7\nwithdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u00b7\ninitiation of investigations by regulators;\n\u00b7\ncosts to defend the related litigation;\n\u00b7\na diversion of management\u2019s time and our resources;\n\u00b7\nsubstantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;\n\u00b7\nproduct recalls, withdrawals or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions;\n\u00b7\nloss of revenue;\n\u00b7\nexhaustion of any available insurance and our capital resources;\n\u00b7\nthe inability to commercialize our products; and\n\u00b7\na decline in our share price.\nOur inability to obtain and retain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable cost to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of products we develop. We currently carry product liability insurance covering our clinical studies and commercial product sales in the amount of approximately $10 million in the aggregate. Although we maintain such insurance, any claim that may be brought against us could result in a court judgment or settlement in an amount that is not covered, in whole or in part, by our insurance or that is in excess of the limits of our insurance coverage. We will have to pay any amounts awarded by a court or negotiated in a settlement that exceed our coverage limitations or that are not covered by our insurance, and we may not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient capital to pay such amounts.\nWe intend to market our products outside of the United States, and we will be subject to the risks of doing business outside of the United States.\nBecause we intend to market products outside of the United States, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business outside of the United States. Accordingly, our business and financial results in the future could be adversely affected due to a variety of factors, including:\n\u00b7\nfailure to develop an international sales, marketing and distribution system for our products;\n\u00b7\nchanges in a specific country\u2019s or region\u2019s political and cultural climate or economic condition;\n\u00b7\nunexpected changes in foreign laws and regulatory requirements;\n\u00b7\ndifficulty of effective enforcement of contractual provisions in local jurisdictions;\n\u00b7\ninadequate intellectual property protection in foreign countries;\n\u00b7\ntrade-protection measures, import or export licensing requirements such as Export Administration Regulations promulgated by the United States Department of Commerce and fines, penalties or suspension or revocation of export privileges;\n\u00b7\nthe effects of applicable foreign tax structures and potentially adverse tax consequences; and\n\u00b7\nsignificant adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Strategy\nWe face substantial competition, which may result in others commercializing products more successfully than we do.\nWe face and will continue to face competition from other companies in the pharmaceutical, medical devices and drug delivery industries. Our products compete a with currently marketed oral opioids, transdermal opioids, local anesthetic patches, stimulants and implantable and external infusion pumps that can be used for infusion of opioids and local anesthetics. Products of these types are marketed or in development by Purdue Pharma, Pfizer, Durect, Endo, Mallinckrodt, Zogenix, Elite Pharmaceuticals, Pain Therapeutics, Nektar, Collegium Pharmaceuticals, Inspirion, Teva,\nPernix, Daichii, Intellipharmaceutics, Acura Pharmaceuticals and others. Some of these companies and many others are applying significant resources and expertise to the challenges of drug delivery, and several are focusing or may focus on drug delivery to the intended site of action. Some of these current and potential future competitors may be addressing the same therapeutic areas or indications as we are. Many of our competitors have substantially more marketing, manufacturing, financial, technical, human and managerial, and research and development resources than we do, and have more institutional experience than we do.\nCompetitors have developed or are in the process of developing technologies that are, or in the future may be, the basis for competitive products. Some of these products may have an entirely different approach or means of accomplishing similar therapeutic effects than our products. Our competitors may develop products that are safer, more effective or less costly than our products and, therefore, present a serious competitive threat to our product offerings.\nThe widespread acceptance of currently available therapies with which our products compete may limit market acceptance of our products. Oral medication, transdermal drug delivery systems, such as drug patches, injectable products and implantable drug delivery devices are currently available treatments for chronic and post-operative pain, are widely accepted in the medical community and have a long history of use. These treatments will compete with our products and the established use of these competitive products may limit the potential for our products to receive widespread acceptance.\nThe use of legal and regulatory strategies by competitors with innovator products, including the filing of citizen petitions, may increase our costs associated with the marketing of our products, significantly reduce the profit potential of our products, or, if successfully partnered, delay or prevent the introduction or approval of our product candidates.\nCompanies with innovator drugs often pursue strategies that may serve to prevent or delay competition from alternatives to their innovator products. These strategies include, but are not limited to:\n\u00b7\nfiling \u201ccitizen petitions\u201d with the FDA that may delay competition by causing delays of our product approvals;\n\u00b7\nseeking to establish regulatory and legal obstacles that would make it more difficult to demonstrate a product\u2019s bioequivalence or \u201csameness\u201d to the related innovator product;\n\u00b7\nfiling suits for patent infringement that automatically delay FDA approval of Section 505(b)(2) products;\n\u00b7\nobtaining extensions of market exclusivity by conducting clinical trials of innovator drugs in pediatric populations or by other methods;\n\u00b7\npersuading the FDA to withdraw the approval of innovator drugs for which the patents are about to expire, thus allowing the innovator company to develop and launch new patented products serving as substitutes for the withdrawn products;\n\u00b7\nseeking to obtain new patents on drugs for which patent protection is about to expire; and\n\u00b7\ninitiating legislative and administrative efforts in various states to limit the substitution of innovator products by pharmacies.\nThese strategies could delay, reduce or eliminate our entry into the market and our ability to generate revenues associated with our product candidates.\nOur future success depends on our ability to retain our key personnel.\nWe are highly dependent upon the services of our key personnel, including our chief executive officer, Robert Radie, our chief financial officer, Stan Musial, our chief operating officer, Mark Strobeck, and our chief commercial officer, Patrick Shea. Although we have entered into employment agreements with each of them, these agreements are at-will and do not prevent them from terminating their employment with us at any time. We do not maintain \u201ckey person\u201d insurance for any of our executives or other employees. The loss of the services of any of Mr. Radie, Mr. Musial, Dr. Strobeck, or Mr. Shea could impede the achievement of our corporate objectives.\nWe may experience issues retaining our officers, key employees and highly skilled personnel due to the fact that the exercise prices of most of our outstanding employee stock options exceed the current market price of our Common Stock.\nOur performance substantially depends on the performance of our officers and other key employees. We also rely on our ability to retain and motivate qualified personnel, especially our management and highly skilled employees. Our ability to retain employees in our highly competitive industry is substantially dependent upon the attractiveness of the equity that we can offer to them. Because the exercise prices of our outstanding employee stock options exceed the market price of our Common Stock, in some cases significantly, the retention value of our outstanding stock options is currently limited. The loss of the services of any of our officers or key employees could cause us to incur increased operating expenses and divert senior management resources in searching for replacements. The loss of their services also could harm our reputations if our customers were to become concerned about our future operations. Our future success also depends on our continuing ability to identify, hire, train and retain other highly skilled personnel. Competition for these personnel is intense, especially in the pharmaceutical industry, and we may experience difficulty in hiring and retaining sufficient numbers of highly skilled employees if the market price of our Common Stock does not improve and/or the exercise prices of our outstanding employee stock options continue to exceed the market price of our Common Stock.\nWe may engage in future acquisitions or business development activities that could disrupt our business, cause dilution to our stockholders or cause us to recognize accounting charges in our financial statements.\nWe may, in the future, make acquisitions of, or investments in, companies or products that we believe have products or capabilities that are a strategic or commercial fit with our products and business or otherwise offer opportunities for our company, including in-licensing technologies. In connection with these acquisitions or investments, we may:\n\u00b7\npay too much for the product or business;\n\u00b7\nissue stock that would dilute our stockholders\u2019 percentage of ownership;\n\u00b7\nincur debt and assume liabilities; and\n\u00b7\nincur amortization expenses related to intangible assets or incur large and immediate write-offs.\nWe also may be unable to find suitable acquisition candidates and we may not be able to complete acquisitions on favorable terms, if at all. In addition, we currently have limited capital resources and a significant amount of outstanding debt, the governing documents of which restrict our ability to make certain capital expenditures, each of which could limit our ability to engage in otherwise attractive acquisition or in-license transactions. We may also issue shares of our common stock in such a transaction, which would result in dilution to our stockholders.\nIf we do complete an acquisition, we cannot assure you that it will ultimately strengthen our competitive position or that it will not be viewed negatively by customers, financial markets or investors. Further, future acquisitions could also pose numerous additional risks to our operations, including:\n\u00b7\nproblems integrating the purchased business, products or technologies;\n\u00b7\nincreases to our expenses;\n\u00b7\nthe failure to have discovered undisclosed liabilities of the acquired asset or company;\n\u00b7\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from their day-to-day responsibilities;\n\u00b7\nentrance into markets in which we have limited or no prior experience; and\n\u00b7\npotential loss of key employees, particularly those of the acquired entity.\nWe may not be able to successfully complete one or more acquisitions or effectively integrate the operations, products or personnel gained through any such acquisition.\nIf we are unable to protect our information systems against service interruption, misappropriation of data or other failures, accidents or breaches of security, our operations could be disrupted, our reputation may be damaged, and our business and operations would suffer.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems, and those of our CROs and other third parties on which we rely, are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. If such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our drug development programs, our commercial activities and business operations, in addition to possibly requiring substantial expenditures of resources to remedy. If such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our commercialization programs. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or ongoing or planned clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach was to result in a loss of or damage to our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability.\nFurther, our reliance on information systems and other technology also gives rise to cybersecurity risks, including security breach, espionage, system disruption, theft and inadvertent release of information. We regularly make investments to upgrade, enhance or replace these systems, as well as leverage new technologies to support our growth strategies. Any delays or difficulties in transitioning to new systems or integrating them with current systems or the failure to implement our initiatives in an orderly and timely fashion could result in additional investment of time and resources, which could impair our ability to improve existing operations and support future growth, and ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business.\nChanges in tax laws and regulations or in our operations may impact our effective tax rate and may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nChanges in tax laws in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate, or adverse outcomes from tax audits that we may be subject to in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate, could result in an unfavorable change in our effective tax rate, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d) was enacted on December 22, 2017. There are various provisions within the Tax Act that could impact our future tax position. The U.S. corporate tax rate was reduced to 21%, the Alternative Minimum Tax was repealed, and Net Operating Losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) generated beginning in 2018 may be carried forward indefinitely but, limited to 80% of taxable income for utilization. However, interest deductions could be\nlimited and certain performance-based compensation deductions could be limited. In addition, we will continue to evaluate the potential impacts of the US taxation of its Controlled Foreign Corporation.\nWe continue to assess the impact of various U.S. federal or state legislative proposals that could result in a material increase to our U.S federal or state taxes. We cannot predict whether any specific legislation will be enacted or the terms of any such legislation. However, if such proposals were to be enacted, or if modifications were to be made to certain existing regulations, the consequences could have a material adverse impact on us, including increasing our tax burden, increasing the cost of tax compliance or otherwise adversely affecting our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nFluctuations in the value of foreign currencies could negatively impact our results of operations and increase our costs.\nSome payments to our employees, suppliers and contract manufacturers are denominated in foreign currencies. Our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, we are exposed to foreign exchange risk, and our reported results of operations may be negatively impacted by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the foreign currency. A significant appreciation in the foreign currency relative to the U.S. dollar would result in higher reported expenses and would cause our net losses to increase. Likewise, to the extent that we generate any revenues denominated in foreign currencies, or become required to make payments in other foreign currencies, fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and those foreign currencies could also negatively impact our reported results of operations. We have not entered into any hedging contracts to mitigate the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nOur business operations may subject us to numerous commercial disputes, claims and/or lawsuits.\nOperating in the pharmaceutical industry, particularly the commercialization of pharmaceutical products, involves numerous commercial relationships, complex contractual arrangements, uncertain intellectual property rights, potential product liability and other aspects that create heightened risks of disputes, claims and lawsuits. In particular, we may face claims related to the safety of our products, intellectual property matters, employment matters, tax matters, commercial disputes, competition, sales and marketing practices, environmental matters, personal injury, insurance coverage and acquisition or divestiture-related matters. Further, pharmaceutical companies have used the Lanham Act, a private right of action that enables a party to sue a competitor for a false or misleading description or representation of fact that misrepresents the nature, characteristics, qualities, or geographic origin of the competitor\u2019s goods, services or commercial activities. Any commercial dispute, claim or lawsuit may divert our management\u2019s attention away from our business, we may incur significant expenses in addressing or defending any commercial dispute, claim or lawsuit, and we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to equitable remedies that could adversely affect our operations and financial results.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nOur foreign NOLs generated by Egalet UK\u2019s operations may be carried forward indefinitely but may become subject to an annual limitation. Upon potential examination by the statutory or governing authority, it may be determined that we experienced a greater than 50% change in share capital, which would limit the availability and use of existing foreign NOLs to offset our taxable income, if any, in the future.\nUnder Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change NOLs and other pre-change tax attributes (such as research tax credits) to offset its post-change income may be limited. We may also experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership some of which are outside our control. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change NOL carryforwards to offset U.S. federal taxable income may be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us. In addition, at the state level, there may be periods during which the use of NOLs is suspended or otherwise limited, which could accelerate or permanently increase state taxes owed.\nRisks Related to Our Compliance with Governmental Regulations\nOur products are subject to ongoing regulatory requirements, and we may face regulatory enforcement action if we do not comply with the requirements.\nManufacturers of drug products and their facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with cGMP and other regulations. If we or a regulatory agency discover problems with a product which were previously unknown, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, a regulatory agency may impose restrictions on that product, the manufacturing facility or us, including requiring recall or withdrawal of the product from the market or suspension of manufacturing. If we, our products or the manufacturing facilities for our products fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency may:\n\u00b7\nissue warning letters or untitled letters;\n\u00b7\nmandate modifications to promotional materials or require us to provide corrective information to healthcare practitioners;\n\u00b7\nrequire us to enter into a consent decree, which can include the imposition of various fines, reimbursements for inspection costs and penalties for noncompliance, and require due dates for specific actions;\n\u00b7\nseek an injunction, impose civil penalties or monetary fines or pursue criminal prosecution, require disgorgement, consider exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs and require curtailment or restructuring of our operations;\n\u00b7\nsuspend or withdraw regulatory approval;\n\u00b7\nsuspend any ongoing clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nrefuse to approve pending applications or supplements to applications filed by us;\n\u00b7\ndeny or reduce quota allotments for the raw material for commercial production of our controlled substance products;\n\u00b7\nsuspend or impose restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements; or\n\u00b7\nseize or detain products, refuse to permit the import or export of products, or require us to initiate a product recall; or\n\u00b7\nrefuse to allow us to enter into government contracts.\nThe occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit our ability to commercialize our products and generate revenue.\nIn addition, the FDA may impose significant restrictions on the approved indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or on the conditions of approval. For example, a product\u2019s approval may contain requirements for potentially costly post-approval studies and surveillance, including Phase 4 clinical trials, to monitor the safety and efficacy of the product. We currently have Phase 4 study requirements for OXAYDO and ARYMO ER. We will collect data on ARYMO ER for one year post marketing, and, depending on the results of the study, additional post-marketing investigations may be required to evaluate the effect of ARYMO ER. We are also subject to ongoing FDA obligations and continued regulatory review with respect to the manufacturing, processing, labeling, packaging, distribution, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion and recordkeeping for our product. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration, as well as continued compliance\nwith cGMPs and with GCPs and good laboratory practices, which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA for all of our products in clinical and pre-clinical development, and for any clinical trials that we conduct post-approval. To the extent that a product is approved for sale in other countries, we may be subject to similar restrictions and requirements imposed by laws and government regulators in those countries. In addition, our product labeling, advertising and promotion are subject to regulatory requirements and continuing regulatory review. The FDA strictly regulates the promotional claims that may be made about prescription drug products. In particular, a drug product may not be promoted for uses that are not approved by the FDA as reflected in the product\u2019s approved labeling, although the FDA does not regulate the prescribing practices of physicians. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including substantial monetary penalties and criminal prosecution.\nOur current and future relationships with healthcare professionals, principal investigators, consultants, customers and third-party payors in the United States and elsewhere may be subject, directly or indirectly, to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, transparency, health information privacy and security and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, and diminished profits and future earnings.\nHealthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors in the United States and elsewhere play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any commercial products. Our current and future arrangements with healthcare professionals, principal investigators, consultants, third-party payors and customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the federal False Claims Act, that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute any product candidates for which we may obtain marketing approval. In addition, we may be subject to physician payment transparency laws and patient privacy and security regulation by the federal government and by the U.S. states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. Restrictions under applicable federal, state and foreign healthcare laws and regulations may affect our ability to operate, including:\n\u00b7\nthe Federal anti-kickback statute, which prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under federal and state healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid;\n\u00b7\nthe federal civil and criminal laws and civil monetary penalty laws, including the False Claims Act, which impose criminal and civil penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government, including erroneous pricing information on which mandatory rebates, discounts and reimbursement amounts are based, or in the case of the civil False Claims Act, for violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute in connection with a claim for payment or for conduct constituting reckless disregard for the truth;\n\u00b7\nthe Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d), which prohibits U.S. firms and individuals from paying bribes to foreign officials in furtherance of a business deal and against the foreign official's duties and specifies required accounting transparency guidelines;\n\u00b7\nstate and foreign anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental payors, including private insurers;\n\u00b7\nHIPAA, which imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;\n\u00b7\nHIPAA, as amended by HITECH and its implementing regulations, which also imposes obligations on certain covered entity healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, as well as their business associates that perform certain services involving the use or disclosure of individually identifiable health information, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n\u00b7\nlaws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers;\n\u00b7\nfederal laws requiring certain drug manufacturers to regularly report information related to payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and other healthcare providers, as well as ownership or investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members, including under the federal Open Payments program, as well as other state and foreign laws regulating marketing activities; and\n\u00b7\nfederal government price reporting laws, which require us to calculate and report complex pricing metrics to government programs, where such reported prices may be used in the calculation of reimbursement and/or discounts on our products and may subject us to potentially significant discounts on our products, increased infrastructure costs, potential liability for the failure to report such prices in an accurate and timely manner and potentially limit our ability to offer certain marketplace discounts; and\n\u00b7\nstate and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nThese laws may affect our sales, marketing, and other promotional activities by imposing administrative and compliance burdens on us.\nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found not to be in compliance with applicable laws, that person or entity may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs, and it is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law interpreting applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, disgorgement exclusion from participation in government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.\nIt is uncertain as to whether, and how, the Affordable Care Act and its related rules and regulations may be affected by the Congress and Trump Administration, given the repeated calls and attempts to amend the Affordable Care Act.\nFailure to comply with ongoing governmental regulations for marketing our products could inhibit our ability to generate revenues from their sale and could also expose us to claims or other sanctions.\nAdvertising and promotion of our products is heavily scrutinized by the FDA, the U.S. Department of Justice, the HHS Office of the Inspector General, state attorneys general, members of Congress and the public. Violations, including unintended promotion of our products for unapproved or off-label uses, are subject to enforcement letters, inquiries and investigations, and civil and criminal sanctions by the FDA. In addition, advertising and promotion of any product candidate that obtains approval outside of the United States will be heavily scrutinized by comparable foreign regulatory authorities.\nIn the United States, engaging in impermissible promotion of our products for off-label uses can also subject us to false claims litigation under federal and state statutes, which can lead to civil and criminal penalties and fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which we promote or distribute our drug products. These false claims statutes include the federal False Claims Act, which allows any individual to bring a lawsuit against a pharmaceutical company on behalf of the federal government alleging submission of false or fraudulent claims, or causing to present such false or fraudulent claims, for payment by a federal program such as Medicare or Medicaid. If the government prevails in the lawsuit, the individual will share in any fines or settlement funds. Since 2004, these False Claims Act lawsuits against pharmaceutical companies have increased significantly in volume and breadth, leading to several substantial civil and criminal settlements based on certain sales practices promoting off-label drug uses. This growth in litigation has increased the risk that a pharmaceutical company will have to defend a false claim action, pay settlement fines or restitution, agree to comply with burdensome reporting and compliance obligations, and be excluded from the Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs. If we do not lawfully promote our products, even if unlawful promotion is inadvertent, we may become subject to such litigation and, if we are not successful in defending against such actions, those actions could compromise our ability to become profitable.\nIn addition, later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, manufacturer or facility, or our failure to update regulatory files, may result in restrictions, including withdrawal of the product from the market. Any of the following or other similar events, if they were to occur, could delay or preclude us from further developing, marketing or realizing the full commercial potential of our products:\n\u00b7\nfailure to obtain or maintain requisite governmental approvals;\n\u00b7\nfailure to obtain or maintain approvals of labeling with abuse-deterrent claims; or\n\u00b7\nFDA required product withdrawals or warnings arising from identification of serious and unanticipated adverse side effects in our product candidates.\nARYMO ER and OXAYDO are subject to mandatory REMS programs, which could increase the cost, burden and liability associated with the commercialization of ARYMO ER and OXAYDO.\nThe FDA has indicated that some opioid drugs formulated with the active ingredients fentanyl, hydromorphone, methadone, morphine, oxycodone, oxymorphone, and others will be required to have a REMS to ensure that the benefits of the drugs continue to outweigh the risks. The FDA has approved a REMS for ER and long-acting (\u201cLA\u201d) and will approve a new REMS that covers both ER and IR opioids as part of a federal initiative to address prescription drug abuse and misuse. Like the ER/LA REMS, the new REMS will introduce new safety measures designed to reduce risks and improve the safe use of ER and IR opioids, while ensuring access to needed medications for patients in pain. The current ER/LA opioid REMS affects more than 20 companies that manufacture these opioid analgesics. Like the current REMS, under the new combined REMS, companies will be required to make education programs available to prescribers based on a revised FDA Blueprint. It is expected that companies will satisfy this obligation by providing educational grants to continuing education providers, who will develop and deliver the training. The REMS will also require companies to make available FDA-approved patient education materials on the safe use of these drugs. The companies must perform periodic assessments of the implementation of the REMS and the success of the program in meeting its goals. The FDA will review these assessments and may require additional elements to achieve the goals of the program.\nARYMO ER and OXAYDO are subject to the REMS requirement. There may be increased cost, administrative burden and potential liability associated with the marketing and sale of products subject to the REMS requirement, which could reduce or remove the commercial benefits to us from the sale of these products and product candidates.\nCertain of our products contain controlled substances, the manufacture, use, sale, importation, exportation and distribution of which are subject to regulation by state, federal and foreign law enforcement and other regulatory agencies.\nOXAYDO and ARYMO ER and our product candidates contain, controlled substances which are subject to state, federal and foreign laws and regulations regarding their manufacture, use, sale, importation, exportation and\ndistribution. OXAYDO and ARYMO ER contain active ingredients that are classified as controlled substances under the CSA and regulations of the DEA. A number of states also independently regulate these drugs as controlled substances. Chemical compounds are classified by the DEA as Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances, with Schedule I substances considered to present the highest risk of substance abuse and Schedule V substances the lowest risk. For our products containing controlled substances, we and our suppliers, manufacturers, contractors, customers and distributors are required to obtain and maintain applicable registrations from state, federal and foreign law enforcement and regulatory agencies and comply with state, federal and foreign laws and regulations regarding the manufacture, use, sale, importation, exportation and distribution of controlled substances. For example, all Schedule II drug prescriptions must be signed by a physician, physically presented to a pharmacist and may not be refilled without a new prescription. Furthermore, the amount of Schedule II substances that can be obtained for clinical trials and commercial distribution is limited by the CSA and DEA regulations. We may not be able to obtain sufficient quantities of these controlled substances to meet the commercial demand of our products or to complete any additional clinical trials.\nIn addition, controlled substances are also subject to regulations governing manufacturing, labeling, packaging, testing, dispensing, production and procurement quotas, recordkeeping, reporting, handling, shipment and disposal. These regulations increase the personnel needs and the expense associated with development and commercialization of product candidates that include controlled substances. Failure to obtain and maintain required registrations or to comply with any applicable regulations could delay or preclude us from developing and commercializing our product candidates that contain controlled substances and subject us to enforcement action. Because of their restrictive nature, these regulations could limit commercialization of our products and product candidates containing controlled substances.\nIf we fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur significant costs.\nIn connection with our research and development activities and our manufacture of materials and product candidates, we are subject to federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations and policies governing the use, generation, manufacture, storage, air emission, effluent discharge, handling and disposal of certain materials, biological specimens and wastes. Although we believe that we have complied with the applicable laws, regulations and policies in all material respects and have not been required to correct any material noncompliance, we may be required to incur significant costs to comply with environmental and health and safety regulations in the future. Current or future laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.\nOur research and development involves the use, generation and disposal of hazardous materials, including chemicals, solvents, agents and biohazardous materials. Although we believe that our safety procedures for storing, handling and disposing of such materials comply with the standards prescribed by state and federal regulations, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. We currently contract with third parties to dispose of these substances that we generate, and we rely on these third parties to properly dispose of these substances in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. If these third parties do not properly dispose of these substances in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, we may be subject to legal action by governmental agencies or private parties for improper disposal of these substances. The costs of defending such actions and the potential liability resulting from such actions are often very large. In the event we are subject to such legal action or we otherwise fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations governing the use, generation and disposal of hazardous materials and chemicals, we could be held liable for any damages that result, and any such liability could exceed our resources.\nAlthough we maintain workers\u2019 compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. We do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us in connection with our storage or disposal of biological, hazardous or radioactive materials.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal controls for financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. We are required, under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This assessment is required to include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting that results in more than a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act also generally requires an attestation from our independent registered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. However, for as long as we remain an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act, we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement.\nOur compliance with Section 404 will require that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management efforts. We currently do not have an internal audit group. During the evaluation and testing process, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective. We cannot assure you that there will not be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting in the future. Any failure to maintain internal control over financial reporting could severely inhibit our ability to accurately report our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. If we are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm determines we have a material weakness or significant deficiency in our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our common stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by Nasdaq, the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) or other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain other effective control systems required of public companies, could also restrict our future access to the capital markets.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud.\nWe are subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. We believe that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.\nThese inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. In addition, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the controls. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in our control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nOur employees, principal investigators, CROs, CMOs and other third-party manufacturers, independent contractors, consultants, collaborators or vendors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements.\nWe are exposed to the risk of fraud or other misconduct by our employees, principal investigators, CROs, CMOs and other third-party manufacturers, independent contractors, consultants, collaborators or vendors. Misconduct by any of these parties could include intentional reckless and/or negligent conduct or failures to:\n\u00b7\ncomply with FDA, DEA or similar regulations or similar regulations of comparable foreign regulatory authorities;\n\u00b7\nprovide accurate information to the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities;\n\u00b7\ncomply with manufacturing standards we have established;\n\u00b7\ncomply with federal and state healthcare laws and regulations and similar laws and regulations established and enforced by comparable foreign regulatory authorities;\n\u00b7\nreport financial information or data accurately; or\n\u00b7\ndisclose unauthorized activities to us.\nIn particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Misconduct by these parties could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. We have adopted a Code of Conduct, but it is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business and results of operations, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and we intend to take advantage of reduced disclosure and governance requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, which could result in our common stock being less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, and we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. We may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company, which could be for up to five years from our initial public offering. See \u201cSummary-Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company.\u201d\nIf investors find our common stock less attractive as a result of our reduced reporting requirements, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. We may also be unable to raise additional capital as and when we need it.\nWe may incur increased compliance costs and our management will be required to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives once we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d\nWe expect to incur significant expense and to devote substantial management effort toward ensuring compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 once we lose our status as an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d Compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, as well as rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission and Nasdaq, for example, will result in ongoing increases in our legal, accounting, administrative and other compliance costs after we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d The Exchange Act, requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. Our board of directors, management and other personnel need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives.\nWe currently do not have an internal audit group, and we will need to hire additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge. Implementing any appropriate changes to our internal controls may require specific compliance training for our directors, officers and employees, entail substantial costs to modify our existing accounting systems, and take a significant period of time to complete. Such changes may not, however, be effective in maintaining the adequacy of our internal controls, and any failure to maintain that adequacy, or consequent inability to produce accurate consolidated financial statements or other reports on a timely basis, could increase our operating costs and could materially impair our ability to operate our business. It is also uncertain what the impact of the new Congress and administration will have on such regulation in light of the President\u2019s campaign promises and executive directives to roll back aspects of, among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties\nDue to the fact that we currently rely on sole suppliers to manufacture the active pharmaceutical ingredients of our products, and a sole supplier for each of our products, any production problems with our suppliers could adversely affect us.\nWe have relied upon supply agreements with third parties for the manufacture and supply of the bulk active pharmaceutical ingredients used in our product candidates for purposes of preclinical testing and clinical trials. We presently depend upon a sole manufacturer of our supply of APIs for each of our products. We also rely on a sole supplier for each of our products. Although we have identified alternate sources for these supplies, it would be time-consuming and costly to qualify these sources. If our suppliers were to terminate our arrangements or fail to meet our supply needs, we could face disruptions in the distribution and sale of our products. We currently do not have secondary sources for our products.\nIf third-party manufacturers of our products fail to devote sufficient time and resources to our concerns, or if their performance is substandard, we may be unable to continue to commercialize our products, and our costs may be higher than expected and could harm our business.\nWe have no manufacturing facilities and have limited experience in drug development and commercial manufacturing. We lack the resources and expertise to formulate, manufacture or test the technical performance of our product candidates. We currently rely on a limited number of experienced personnel and single contract manufacturers (\u201cCMO\u201d) to manufacture ARYMO ER, SPRIX Nasal Spray and OXAYDO. We purchase our required quantities of SPRIX Nasal Spray through purchase orders and while we have an understanding with the manufacturer of SPRIX Nasal Spray regarding an exit strategy if our relationship with that manufacturer were to be terminated, we cannot assure you that a termination of this relationship would not result in a supply disruption. Our reliance on a limited number of vendors and manufacturers exposes us to the following risks, any of which could interrupt commercialization of our products, delay our clinical trials, result in higher costs, or deprive us of potential product revenues:\n\u00b7\nCMOs, their sub-contractors or other third parties we rely on, may encounter difficulties in achieving the volume of production needed to satisfy clinical needs or commercial demand, may experience technical issues that impact quality or compliance with applicable and strictly enforced regulations governing the\nmanufacture of pharmaceutical products, and may experience shortages of qualified personnel to adequately staff production operations.\n\u00b7\nOur CMOs could default on or, under certain circumstances, terminate their agreements or purchase orders with us to provide clinical supplies or meet our requirements for commercialization of our products.\n\u00b7\nFor certain of our products, the use of alternate CMOs may be difficult because the number of potential CMOs that have the necessary governmental licenses to produce narcotic products is limited. In addition, the FDA and the DEA must approve any alternative manufacturer of our products before we may use the alternative manufacturer to produce our products.\n\u00b7\nIt may be difficult or impossible for us to find a replacement CMO on acceptable terms quickly, or at all. Our CMOs and vendors may not perform as agreed or may not remain in the contract manufacturing business for the time required to successfully produce, store and distribute our products.\nThe FDA and other regulatory authorities require that our products be manufactured according to cGMP and similar foreign standards. Any failure by our CMOs to comply with cGMP, including any failure to deliver sufficient quantities of products in a timely manner could be the basis for the FDA to issue a warning or untitled letter, withdraw approvals for products, or take other regulatory or legal action, including recall or seizure, total or partial suspension of production, suspension of ongoing clinical trials, refusal to approve pending applications or supplemental applications, detention or product, refusal to permit the import or export of products, injunction, imposing civil penalties, or pursuing criminal prosecution.\nOur utilization of CMOs could also result in our lack of visibility throughout our supply chain, which could result in shortages in the supply of our products or, conversely, the build-up of more inventory than we require. Failures or difficulties faced at any level of our supply chain could materially adversely affect our business and delay or impede the development and commercialization of any of our products or product candidates and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our preclinical studies and clinical trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for any supplemental drug applications relating to changes to the labels of or new dosage strengths for our products or receive regulatory approval for any product candidate we are able to partner.\nWe have relied upon and plan to continue to rely upon third-party contract research organizations (\u201cCROs\u201d) to monitor and manage data for our ongoing preclinical and clinical programs. We rely on these parties for execution of our preclinical studies and clinical trials, and control only certain aspects of their activities. Nevertheless, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our studies is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol and legal, regulatory and scientific standards, and our reliance on the CROs does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. We also rely on third parties to assist in conducting our preclinical studies in accordance with Good Laboratory Practices (\u201cGLP\u201d) and the Animal Welfare Act requirements. We and our CROs are required to comply with federal regulations and current GCP which are international standards meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, advisors and monitors, enforced by the FDA, the Competent Authorities of the Member States of the European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d) and comparable foreign regulatory authorities for all of our products in clinical development. Regulatory authorities enforce these GCP through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and trial sites. If we or any of our CROs fail to comply with applicable GCP, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our applications. We cannot assure you that upon inspection by a given regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that any of our clinical trials comply with GCP requirements. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with product produced under cGMP requirements. Failure to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat preclinical studies and clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process.\nOur CROs are not our employees, and except for remedies available to us under our agreements with them, we cannot control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our ongoing clinical and preclinical programs. If CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols, regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for any supplemental drug applications relating to changes to the labels of or new dosage strengths for our products or receive regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize any of our product candidates that we successfully partner. As a result, the commercial prospects for our products or partnered product candidates, as the case may be, would be harmed, our costs could increase and our ability to generate additional revenues could be delayed.\nBecause we have relied on third parties, our internal capacity to perform these functions is limited. Outsourcing these functions involves risks that third parties may not perform to our standards, may not produce results in a timely manner or may fail to perform at all. In addition, the use of third-party service providers requires us to disclose our proprietary information to these parties, which could increase the risk that this information will be misappropriated. We currently have a small number of employees, which limits the internal resources we have available to identify and monitor our third-party providers. To the extent we are unable to identify and successfully manage the performance of third-party service providers in the future, our ability to advance any clinical trials will be compromised. Though we carefully manage our relationships with our CROs, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter similar challenges or delays in the future.\nIf we lose our relationships with CROs, our clinical trial efforts could be delayed.\nWe rely on third-party vendors and CROs for preclinical studies and clinical trials related to expanding the labels for our existing products or, if successfully partnered, developing our product candidates. Switching or adding additional CROs involves additional cost and requires management time and focus. Our CROs have the right to terminate their agreements with us in the event of an uncured material breach. In addition, some of our CROs have an ability to terminate their respective agreements with us if it can be reasonably demonstrated that the safety of the subjects participating in our clinical trials warrants such termination, if we make a general assignment for the benefit of our creditors or if we are liquidated. Identifying, qualifying and managing performance of third-party service providers can be difficult and time-consuming. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new CRO commences work and the new CRO may not provide the same type or level of services as the original provider. If any of our relationships with our third-party CROs terminate, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative CROs or to do so on commercially reasonable terms.\nWe may seek collaborations with third parties to market and commercialize our products, including outside of the United States, who may fail to effectively and compliantly market our products and suffer reputational harm.\nWe have and may continue to rely on third-party collaborators to assist us with marketing our products, including outside of the United States. For example, we have co-promotion arrangements in place in the United States with Ascend Therapeutics to promote SPRIX Nasal Spray to its target women's healthcare practitioners and with OraPharma to promote SPRIX Nasal Spray to dentists, dental specialists and oral surgeons. We currently possess limited resources and may not be successful in establishing additional collaborations or co-promotion arrangements on acceptable terms, if at all. We also face competition in our search for collaborators and co-promoters. By entering into strategic collaborations or similar arrangements, we will rely on third parties for financial resources and for commercialization, sales and marketing and regulatory expertise. Our collaborators may fail to market our products in a legally compliant manner, which could subject us to regulatory risk and reputational harm. Any failure of our third-party collaborators to successfully market and commercialize our products and product candidates in a legally-compliant manner both in and outside of the United States would diminish our revenues and could harm our reputation.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights for our technology and products, we may lose valuable assets or experience reduced market share.\nWe depend on our ability to protect our proprietary technology. We rely on patent and trademark laws, trade secrets and know-how, and confidentiality, licensing and other agreements with employees and third parties, all of which offer only limited protection. Our success depends in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in the United States and other countries with respect to our proprietary technology and products, including product candidates.\nThe steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to preclude misappropriation of our proprietary information or infringement of our intellectual property rights, both inside and outside the United States. The rights already granted under any of our currently issued patents and those that may be granted from pending patent applications may not provide us with the proprietary protection or competitive advantages we are seeking. Further, given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such product candidates might expire before or shortly after such product candidates are commercialized. If we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for our technology and products, or if the scope of the patent protection obtained is not sufficient, our competitors could develop and commercialize technology and products identical, similar or superior to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our technology and products may be adversely affected.\nWith respect to patent rights, our patent applications may not issue into patents, and any issued patents may not provide protection against competitive technologies, may be held invalid or unenforceable if challenged or may be interpreted in a manner that does not adequately protect our technology or products. Even if our patent applications issue into patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection, prevent competitors from competing with us, or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. The examination process may require us to narrow the claims in our patent applications, which may limit the scope of patent protection that may be obtained. Our competitors may design around or otherwise circumvent patents issued to us or licensed by us.\nThe patent prosecution process is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. The United States Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cUSPTO\u201d) and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. In addition, periodic maintenance fees on issued patents are required to be paid to the USPTO and foreign patent agencies in several stages over the lifetime of the patents. While an inadvertent lapse can in many cases be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. Non-compliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application include, but are not limited to, failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time limits, non-payment of fees and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents.\nIt is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of inventions made in the course of our development and commercialization activities before it is too late to obtain patent protection on them. Further, publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions typically are not published until 18 months after filing or, in some cases, not at all. Therefore, we cannot be certain that we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our owned or licensed patents or pending patent applications, or that we were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain.\nRecent patent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs associated with the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents. The Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (\u201cLeahy-Smith Act\u201d) which was signed into law on September 16, 2011, made significant changes to U.S. patent law, including provisions that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted and litigated. Many of the substantive changes\nto patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith Act and, in particular, the \u201cfirst to file\u201d provisions described below, only became effective on March 16, 2013. The Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents.\nPursuant to the Leahy-Smith Act, the United States transitioned to a \u201cfirst to file\u201d system in which, assuming that other requirements for patentability are met, the first inventor to file a patent application will be entitled to the patent on an invention regardless of whether a third party was the first to invent the claimed invention. The Leahy-Smith Act also includes a number of significant changes that affect the way patent applications will be prosecuted and also may affect patent litigation. These include allowing third party submission of prior art to the USPTO during patent prosecution and additional procedures to attack the validity of a patent by USPTO administered post-grant proceedings, including post-grant review, inter partes review, and derivation proceedings. An adverse determination based on any such submission or proceeding before the USPTO or opposition before a foreign patent agency could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our patent rights, which could adversely affect our competitive position with respect to third parties.\nBecause the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, issued patents that we own or have licensed from third parties may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. Such challenges may result in the loss of patent protection, the narrowing of claims in such patents, or the invalidity or unenforceability of such patents, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection for our technology and products.\nIf third parties claim that our technology or products infringe upon their intellectual property, this could result in costly litigation and potentially limit our ability to commercialize our products.\nThere is a substantial amount of litigation, both within and outside the United States, involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical industry. We may, from time to time, be notified of claims that we are infringing upon patents, trademarks, copyrights, or other intellectual property rights owned by third parties, and we cannot provide assurances that other companies will not, in the future, pursue such infringement claims against us or any third-party proprietary technologies we have licensed.\nOur commercial success depends in part upon our ability to develop product candidates and commercialize future products without infringing the intellectual property rights of others. Our products and current or future product candidates, or any uses of them, may now or in the future infringe third-party patents or other intellectual property rights. This is due in part to the considerable uncertainty within the pharmaceutical industry about the validity, scope and enforceability of many issued patents in the United States and elsewhere in the world and, to date, there is no consistency regarding the breadth of claims allowed in pharmaceutical patents. We cannot currently determine the ultimate scope and validity of patents which may be granted to third parties in the future or which patents might be asserted to be infringed by the manufacture, use and sale of our products. In part as a result of this uncertainty, there has been, and we expect that there may continue to be, significant litigation in the pharmaceutical industry regarding patents and other intellectual property rights.\nThird parties may assert infringement claims against us, or other parties we have agreed to indemnify, based on existing patents or patents that may be granted in the future. We are aware of third-party patents and patent applications related to morphine or oxycodone drugs and formulations, including those listed in the FDA\u2019s Orange Book for morphine or oxycodone products. Since patent applications are published after a certain period of time after filing, and because applications can take several years to issue, there may be currently pending third-party patent applications that are unknown to us, which may later result in issued patents. Because of the inevitable uncertainty in intellectual property litigation, any litigation could result in an adverse decision, even if the case against us was weak or flawed.\nIf we are found to infringe a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, or if a third party that we were licensing technologies from was found to infringe upon a patent or other intellectual property rights of another third party, we could be required to obtain a license from such third party to continue developing and commercializing our products and technology. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we are able to obtain a license, it may be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same\ntechnologies licensed to us. In addition, in any such proceeding or litigation, we could be found liable for monetary damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees, if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing our technology or product candidates, or reengineer or rebrand our product candidates, if feasible, or force us to cease some of our business operations.\nIn connection with any NDA that we file under Section 505(b)(2) of the FFDCA for any of our product candidates that we successfully partner, we will also be required to notify the patent holder that we have certified to the FDA that any patents listed for the reference label drug in the FDA\u2019s Orange Book publication are invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the manufacture, use or sale of our drug. If the patent holder files a patent infringement lawsuit against us within 45 days of its receipt of notice of our certification, the FDA is automatically prevented from approving our Section 505(b)(2) NDA until the earliest of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a court decision in the infringement case that is favorable to us. Accordingly, we may invest significant time and expense in the development of our product candidates only to be subject to significant delay and patent litigation before our product candidates may be commercialized. There is always a risk that someone may bring an infringement claim against us. Even if we are found not to infringe, or a plaintiff\u2019s patent claims are found invalid or unenforceable, defending any such infringement claim would be expensive and time-consuming, and would delay launch of Egalet-002 and our other product candidates and distract management from their normal responsibilities.\nCompetitors may sue us as a way of delaying the introduction of our products. Any litigation, including any interference or derivation proceedings to determine priority of inventions, oppositions or other post-grant review proceedings to patents in the United States or in countries outside the United States, or litigation against our partners may be costly and time consuming and could harm our business. We expect that litigation may be necessary in some instances to determine the validity and scope of our proprietary rights. Litigation may be necessary in other instances to determine the validity, scope or non-infringement of certain patent rights claimed by third parties to be pertinent to the manufacture, use or sale of our products. Ultimately, the outcome of such litigation could compromise the validity and scope of our patent or other proprietary rights or hinder our ability to manufacture and market our products.\nWe have been, and in the future may be, forced to litigate to enforce or defend our intellectual property, and/or the intellectual property rights of our licensors, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful, and result in the loss of valuable assets.\nWe have been, and may in the future be, forced to litigate to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights against infringement and unauthorized use by competitors, and to protect our trade secrets. In so doing, we may place our intellectual property at risk of being invalidated, unenforceable, or limited or narrowed in scope. For example, on February 23, 2018, we received notice from Teva that Teva has submitted an ANDA with the FDA seeking regulatory approval to market a generic version of ARYMO ER. The notice from Teva included a \u201cParagraph IV certification\u201d with respect to two of our Orange Book-listed patents, alleging that the patents are invalid, unenforceable and/or will not be infringed by the commercial manufacture, use or sale of Teva\u2019s proposed generic product. Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, we have 45 days from receipt of the notice to determine if we will file a patent infringement suit. If we do bring such a suit, a stay of approval will be imposed by the FDA on Teva\u2019s ANDA for the earlier of 30 months or a decision in the infringement case that each of the patents is invalid or not infringed. We intend to vigorously enforce our intellectual property rights, but cannot predict the outcome of this matter.\nFurther, an adverse result in any litigation or defense proceedings may place pending applications at risk of non-issuance. In addition, if any licensor fails to enforce or defend their intellectual property rights, this may adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates and prevent competitors from making, using, and selling competing products. Any such litigation, even if resolved in our favor, could cause us to incur significant expenses, and distract our technical or management personnel from their normal responsibilities. Any such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce the resources available for development activities or any future sales, marketing or distribution activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to adequately conduct the litigation or proceedings. Many of our current and potential competitors have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to defend their intellectual property rights than we can. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property. Litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of management resources, which could harm our business and\nfinancial results. Further, protecting against the unauthorized use of our patented technology, trademarks and other intellectual property rights is expensive, difficult and, may in some cases not be possible. In some cases, it may be difficult or impossible to detect third party infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights, even in relation to issued patent claims, and proving any such infringement may be even more difficult.\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during litigation. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments, and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nIf we breach any of the agreements under which we license rights to products or technology from others, we could lose license rights that are material to our business or be subject to claims by our licensors.\nWe license rights to OXAYDO from Acura and to SPRIX Nasal Spray from Recordati, and we may enter into additional licenses in the future for products and technology that may be important to our business. Under our agreement with Acura we are subject to, and under future license agreements we may be subject to, a range of commercialization and development, sublicensing, royalty, patent prosecution and maintenance, insurance and other obligations. Under our agreement with Recordati, which was assigned to us as part of our acquisition of SPRIX Nasal Spray from Luitpold, we are obligated to use best commercial efforts to market and sell SPRIX Nasal Spray and we pay a royalty to Recordati in connection with the SPRIX Nasal Spray license. Any failure by us to comply with any of these obligations or any other breach by us of our license agreements could give the licensor the right to terminate the license in whole, terminate the exclusive nature of the license or bring a claim against us for damages. Any such termination or claim, particularly relating to our agreement with respect to OXAYDO, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or business. Even if we contest any such termination or claim and are ultimately successful, such dispute could lead to delays in the development or commercialization of products and result in time-consuming and expensive litigation or arbitration. In addition, on termination we may be required to license to the licensor any related intellectual property that we developed.\nWe may be subject to claims by third parties of ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property or obligations to make compensatory payments to employees.\nWhile it is our policy to require our employees and contractors who may be involved in the development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing or obtaining such an agreement with each party who, in fact, develops intellectual property that we regard as our own. In addition, they may breach the assignment agreements or such agreements may not be self-executing, and we may be forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims they may bring against us, to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property. If we fail in prosecuting or defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel.\nIn accordance with the provisions of the Danish Act on inventions of employees, we may be required to make a compensatory payment to an employee in return for the assignment to us of his or her rights to an invention made within the course of his or her employment. Any such payment would reduce the cash available to fund our operations.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed.\nWe rely on trade secrets, to protect our proprietary know-how, technology and other proprietary information, where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable, to maintain our competitive position. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We rely, in part, on non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements that we enter into with parties who have access to them, such as our employees, corporate collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties. Despite these efforts, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade\nsecret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts both within and outside the United States may be less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent such competitor, or those to whom they communicate them, from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed or independently developed, our competitive position would be harmed.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nWe rely upon a combination of patents, trade secret protection (i.e., know-how), and confidentiality agreements to protect the intellectual property of our products, including our product candidates. The strength of patents in the pharmaceutical field involves complex legal and scientific questions and can be uncertain. Where appropriate, we seek patent protection for certain aspects of our products and technology. Filing, prosecuting and defending patents on all of our products throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop and sell their own products and, further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our products in jurisdictions where we do not have any issued patents or our patent claims or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from so competing.\nThe patent position of pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has in recent years been the subject of much litigation. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection. The laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and these foreign laws may also be subject to change.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to pharmaceuticals, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or the marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial cost and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers.\nMany of our employees, including our senior management, were previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. These employees typically executed proprietary rights, non-disclosure and non-competition agreements in connection with their previous employment. Although we try to ensure that our employees do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or these employees have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such employee\u2019s former employer. We are not aware of any threatened or pending claims related to these matters, but in the future litigation may be necessary to defend against such claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nWe may need to license intellectual property from third parties, and such licenses may not be available or may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.\nA third party may hold intellectual property, including patent rights, which is important or necessary to the development of our product candidates. It may be necessary for us to use the patented or proprietary technology of a third party to commercialize our own technology or products candidates, in which case we would be required to obtain a license from such third party. A license to such intellectual property may not be available or may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.\nRisks Related to our Product Candidates\nIf we do not find suitable partners to assist us with the development and regulatory submissions for our product candidates, we may not be able to further develop or seek regulatory approval for Egalet-002 and our other product candidates and we may not realize any return on our investment in those assets.\nAlthough we have completed our phase 3 studies for Egalet-002, we have determined to delay indefinitely our previously-announced anticipated 2019 filing date for the Egalet-002 NDA, unless we find a partner to share the cost. We have also ceased, for the time being, the research and development of Egalet-003, an AD stimulant, and Egalet-004, an AD, ER hydrocodone, which were developed using our Guardian Technology. We are seeking partners for those product candidates as well. If we are unable to find suitable partners, we not be able to seek regulatory approval for Egalet-002 or perform additional necessary preclinical or clinical studies for our other product candidates. As a result, we may not realize any return on the investments we have made in our product candidates or our Guardian Technology.\nIn addition to the level of commercial success of our products, our future growth is also dependent in part on our ability to successfully develop a pipeline of product candidates, including through potential acquisitions, and we cannot give any assurance that we will be able to find a partner for any of our product candidates, that such product candidates will receive regulatory approval or that any approved product candidates will be successfully commercialized.\nOur long-term growth will be limited unless we can successfully develop and expand our pipeline of additional product candidates, including through potential acquisitions. To date, we have only generated aggregate sales of our products of approximately $46.8 million and an aggregate of $22.6 million in revenues from various collaborative and research and development arrangements, including aggregate payments of $20.0 million under our prior collaboration and licensing agreement with Shionogi that was terminated in December 2015. To expand our growth in the long term, we must successfully research, develop, obtain regulatory approval for, manufacture, introduce, market and distribute our product candidates under development. For Egalet-002, and each additional product candidate that we hope to commercialize, we or a collaborator must successfully meet a number of critical developmental milestones, including:\n\u00b7\nselecting and developing a drug delivery platform technology to deliver the proper dose of drug over the desired period of time;\n\u00b7\ndetermining the appropriate drug dosage;\n\u00b7\ndeveloping drug dosages that will be tolerated, safe and effective;\n\u00b7\ndemonstrating the drug formulation will be stable for commercially reasonable time periods;\n\u00b7\ndemonstrating through clinical trials that the drug is safe and effective in patients for the intended indication;\n\u00b7\ndemonstrating an effective abuse-deterrent profile based on the target product profile; and\n\u00b7\ncompleting the manufacturing development and scale-up to permit manufacture of our product candidates in commercial quantities and at acceptable prices.\nThe time necessary to achieve these developmental milestones for any individual product candidate is long and uncertain, and we or a partner may not successfully complete these milestones for any of our product candidates in development. We may not be able to finalize the design or formulation of any product candidate. In addition, we may select components, solvents, excipients or other ingredients to include in our product candidates that have not been previously approved for use in pharmaceutical products, which may require us or our partner to perform additional studies and may delay clinical testing and regulatory approval of our product candidates. Even after we complete the\ndesign of a product candidate, the product candidate must still be shown to be bioequivalent to an approved drug or safe and effective in required preclinical studies and clinical trials before approval for commercialization.\nWe have suspended our development of our product candidates and are looking for a partner for those product candidates with which we may explore possible design or formulation changes to address bioequivalence, safety, efficacy, manufacturing efficiency and performance issues. We or a partner may not be able to complete development of product candidates that will be safe and effective and that will have a commercially reasonable treatment and storage period. If we or a partner are unable to complete development of Egalet-002 or any of our other product candidates, we will not be able to earn revenue from them.\nTo the extent we elect to enter into additional licensing or collaboration agreements to further develop our product candidates, our dependence on such relationships may reduce our revenues from our products or could lengthen the time for us to generate cash flows from the sale of any of our product candidates.\nOur commercialization strategy for our product candidates in clinical and preclinical development will depend on our ability to enter into agreements with partners to obtain assistance and funding for the development and potential commercialization of these product candidates. Supporting diligence activities conducted by potential collaborators and negotiating the financial and other terms of a collaboration agreement can be long and complex processes with uncertain results. Even if we are successful in entering into additional collaboration agreements, collaborations may involve greater uncertainty for us, as we have less control over certain aspects of our collaborative programs than we do over our proprietary development and commercialization programs. We may determine that continuing a collaboration under the terms provided is not in our best interest, and we may terminate the collaboration. Our collaborators could delay or terminate their agreements, and our products subject to collaborative arrangements may never be successfully commercialized. Collaborations involving our product candidates pose the following risks to us:\n\u00b7\nCollaborators have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaborations.\n\u00b7\nCollaborators may not pursue development and commercialization of our product candidates or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs based on clinical trial results, changes in the collaborator\u2019s strategic focus or available funding or external factors such as an acquisition that diverts resources or creates competing priorities.\n\u00b7\nCollaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial program, stop a clinical trial or abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new formulation of a product candidate for clinical testing.\n\u00b7\nCollaborators may conduct clinical trials inappropriately, or may obtain unfavorable results in their clinical trials, which may have an adverse effect on the development of our own programs.\n\u00b7\nCollaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with our product candidates if the collaborators believe that competitive products are more likely to be successfully developed or can be commercialized under terms that are more economically attractive than ours.\n\u00b7\nA collaborator with marketing and distribution rights to one or more products may not commit sufficient resources to the marketing and distribution of such products.\n\u00b7\nCollaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation.\n\u00b7\nDisputes may arise between the collaborators and us that result in the delay or termination of the research, development or commercialization of our product candidates or that result in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts management attention and resources.\n\u00b7\nCollaborations may be terminated and, if terminated, may result in a need for additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable product candidates.\n\u00b7\nCollaboration agreements may not lead to development or commercialization of product candidates in the most efficient manner or at all. If a present or future collaborator of ours were to be involved in a business combination, the continued pursuit and emphasis on our product development or commercialization program under such collaboration could be delayed, diminished or terminated.\nFurther, our future collaborators may develop alternative products or pursue alternative technologies either on their own or in collaboration with others, including our competitors, and the priorities or focus of our collaborators may shift such that our programs receive less attention or resources than we would like, or they may be terminated altogether. Any such actions by our collaborators would compromise our ability to earn revenues. In addition, we could have disputes with our future collaborators, such as the interpretation of terms in our agreements. Any such disagreements could lead to delays in the development or commercialization of any potential products or could result in time-consuming and expensive litigation or arbitration, which may not be resolved in our favor.\nEven with respect to certain other programs that we intend to commercialize ourselves, we may enter into agreements with collaborators to share in the burden of conducting clinical trials, manufacturing and marketing our product candidates or products. In addition, our ability to apply our proprietary technologies to develop proprietary compounds will depend on our ability to establish and maintain licensing arrangements or other collaborative arrangements with the holders of proprietary rights to such compounds. We may not be able to establish such arrangements on favorable terms or at all, and our future collaborative arrangements may not be successful.\nOur competitors may discover, develop or commercialize products before, and more successfully than, our product candidates.\nMany of our competitors have substantially more marketing, manufacturing, financial, technical, human and managerial, and research and development resources than we do, and have more institutional experience than we do. As a result of these factors, our competitors may obtain regulatory approval of their products more rapidly than we are able to or may obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights that allow them to develop and commercialize their products before us and limit our ability to develop or commercialize our product candidates. Our competitors may also develop drugs that are safer, more effective, more widely used and less costly than ours, and they may also be more successful than us in manufacturing and marketing their products.\nFurthermore, if the FDA approves a competitor\u2019s 505(b)(2) application for a drug candidate before our application for a similar drug candidate, and grants the competitor a period of exclusivity, the FDA may take the position that it cannot approve our NDA for a similar drug candidate or that our label cannot reflect certain claims because they are barred by exclusivity. For example, while the FDA approved label for ARYMO ER contains an abuse-deterrent claim for the intravenous route of abuse, the FDA did not approve the inclusion of abuse-deterrent claims for the oral and intranasal routes of abuse. The intranasal abuse-deterrent claim was blocked by another company\u2019s exclusivity, which expires in October 2018. We also believe that several competitors are developing extended-release oxycodone products, and if the FDA approves a competitor\u2019s 505(b)(2) application for an extended-release oxycodone product and grants exclusivity before our NDA for Egalet-002 is filed and approved, we could be subject to a delay that would dramatically reduce our expected market potential for Egalet-002. In addition, even if our 505(b)(2) application for Egalet-002 is approved first, we may still be subject to competition from other oxycodone products, including products or other approved 505(b)(2) NDAs for different conditions of use that would not be restricted by any grant of exclusivity to us.\nRisks Related to the Clinical Development and Regulatory Approval of Our Products and Product Candidates\nThe regulatory approval processes of the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities can be lengthy, time-consuming and inherently unpredictable, and if we are ultimately unable to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates or for supplemental applications we may file for our products, our business will be substantially harmed.\nThe time required to obtain approval by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities is unpredictable, but typically takes many years following the commencement of preclinical studies and clinical trials and depends upon numerous factors, including the substantial discretion of the regulatory authorities. In addition, approval policies, regulations, or the type and amount of clinical data necessary to gain approval varies among jurisdictions and may change during the course of a product candidate\u2019s clinical development. It is possible that none of our existing product candidates or any future product candidates we may in-license, acquire or develop will ever obtain regulatory approval. It is also possible that we may re-evaluate the path of a particular product or product candidate at different points in the approval and post-approval process, even deciding, in some cases, to discontinue development of a product candidate or take a product off the market.\nOur product candidates could fail to receive regulatory approval from the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority for many reasons, including:\n\u00b7\ndisagreement with or disapproval of the design or implementation of our clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nfailure to demonstrate that a product candidate is safe and effective for its proposed indication;\n\u00b7\nfailure to sufficiently deter abuse;\n\u00b7\nfailure of clinical trials to meet the level of statistical significance required for approval;\n\u00b7\nfailure to demonstrate that a product candidate\u2019s clinical and other benefits outweigh its safety risks;\n\u00b7\na negative interpretation of the data from our preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u00b7\ndeficiencies in the manufacturing processes or failure of third-party manufacturing facilities with whom we contract for clinical and commercial supplies to pass inspection; or\n\u00b7\ninsufficient data collected from clinical trials of our product candidates or changes in the approval policies or regulations that render our preclinical and clinical data insufficient to support the submission and filing of an NDA or to obtain regulatory approval.\nAny SNDA for our products could also fail to receive regulatory approval from the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority if there is a disagreement with or disapproval of the design or implementation of our clinical trials; if there is a failure to demonstrate that the product sufficiently deters a particular route of abuse, if any clinical trials fail to meet the level of statistical significance required for approval; or if there are changes in the approval policies or regulations that render our clinical data insufficient to support the submission and filing of a sNDA or to obtain regulatory approval, among others.\nThe FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority may require more information, including additional preclinical or clinical data to support approval, which may delay or prevent approval and our commercialization plans, or cause us to abandon the development program. Even if we obtain regulatory approval, our product candidates may be approved for fewer or more limited indications than we request, such approval may be contingent on the performance of costly post-marketing clinical trials, or we may not be allowed to include the labeling claims necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of such product candidate. Any FDA determination that our NDA or sNDA submission is incomplete or insufficient for filing, results in FDA refusing to file the NDA or sNDA. A refusal to file by\nthe FDA requires us to expend additional time and resources to revise and resubmit our NDA or sNDA. There is no guarantee that any revised or resubmitted NDA or sNDA filing we make will be accepted by the FDA.\nIn addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, a NDA or sNDA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product candidate for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product candidate is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. We filed a sNDA for SPRIX Nasal Spray in December 2015, based on pediatric data initially generated and submitted by former sponsors. We received a refusal to file notice from the FDA on February 25, 2016. The FDA indicated that the filing review represents a preliminary review of the application and is not indicative of deficiencies that would be identified if FDA performed a complete review.\nIn addition, if our product candidate produces undesirable side effects or safety issues, the FDA may require the establishment of a REMS, or a comparable foreign regulatory authority may require the establishment of a similar strategy, that may, for instance, restrict distribution of our products and impose burdensome implementation requirements on us. For example, certain of our products are and we expect that Egalet-002, if approved, will be subject to REMS or other post-marketing requirements, such as lengthy and costly post-marketing studies. Any of the foregoing scenarios could materially harm the commercial prospects for our products and product candidates.\nTo market and sell our products outside of the United States, we must obtain separate marketing approvals and comply with numerous and various regulatory requirements and regimes, which can involve additional testing, may take substantially longer than the FDA approval process, and still generally include all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval. In addition, in many countries outside the United States, it is required that the product be approved for reimbursement before the product can be approved for sale in that country. FDA approval does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions, approval by one regulatory authority outside the United States does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions or by the FDA, and we may not obtain any regulatory approvals on a timely basis, if at all. We may not be able to file for marketing approvals and may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our products in any market. If we are unable to obtain approval of any of our product candidates by regulatory authorities in the European Union, China or another country, the commercial prospects of that product candidate may be significantly diminished, and our business prospects could decline.\nIf we fail to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals for any of our product candidates that we are able to partner, or if such approvals are limited, we will not be able to fully commercialize our product candidates.\nEven if we comply with all FDA pre-approval regulatory requirements, the FDA may not determine that some or all of our product candidates are safe and effective, and we may never obtain regulatory approval for some or all of our product candidates. If we fail to obtain regulatory approval for some or all of our product candidates, we will have fewer commercial products, and correspondingly lower product revenues. Even if our product candidates receive regulatory approval, such approval may involve limitations on the indications and conditions of use or marketing claims for our products. For example, the FDA approved label for ARYMO ER contains abuse-deterrent claims for the intravenous route of abuse, but the FDA did not approve the inclusion of abuse-deterrent claims for the oral and intranasal routes of abuse. The intranasal abuse-deterrent claim was blocked by another company\u2019s exclusivity.\nFurther, while the FDA has issued guidance on requirements for abuse-deterrent labeling, including the studies that must be performed, and although we intend to conduct such studies if we are able to find suitable partners for our product candidates, there can be no assurance that our product candidates that are approved will receive FDA-approved labeling that describes any or all of the abuse-deterrent features of such product candidates.\nAny product candidates that we are able to partner may also have other properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval or limit the commercial profile of their approved product label. These properties may come to light in the form of adverse events experienced during clinical trials.\nWe cannot be sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether the FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes may be on the marketing approval of\nany product candidates we are able to partner. In addition, increased scrutiny by the U.S. Congress of the FDA\u2019s approval process may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval of any NDAs we file, as well as subject us to more stringent product labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements. Even if we are able to partner some of our product candidates and obtain regulatory approval for them, they may be subject to mandatory REMs programs, which could increase the cost, burden and liability associated with their commercialization.\nIn jurisdictions outside the United States, we must receive marketing authorizations from the appropriate regulatory authorities before commercializing our product candidates. Regulatory approval processes outside the United States generally include requirements and risks similar to, and in many cases in excess of, the risks associated with FDA approval.\nIf we are unable to design, conduct and complete clinical trials successfully, our product candidates will not be able to receive regulatory approval.\nIn order to obtain FDA approval for any of our product candidates, we must submit to the FDA an NDA with substantial evidence that demonstrates that the product candidate is both safe and effective in humans for its intended use. This demonstration requires significant research, preclinical studies and clinical trials.\nClinical trials are time-consuming, very expensive and difficult to design and implement, in part because they are subject to rigorous requirements. We could encounter problems that cause abandonment or repetition of clinical trials. If patients participating in clinical trials suffer drug-related adverse reactions during the course of such clinical trials, or if we or the FDA believe that participating patients are being exposed to unacceptable health risks, such clinical trials will have to be suspended or terminated. Suspensions, termination or the need to repeat a clinical trial can occur at any stage.\nWe may be unable to establish bioequivalence for our product candidates at a statistically significant level, which would require us to design and complete additional clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of our product candidates.\nThe clinical trial success of each of our product candidates designed to reduce potential risks of unintended use and abuse depends on reaching statistically significant changes in patients\u2019 symptoms based on clinician-rated scales. There is a lack of consensus regarding standardized processes for assessing clinical outcomes based on clinician-rated scales. Accordingly, the scores from our clinical trials may not be reliable, useful or acceptable to the FDA or other regulatory agencies.\nChanges in standards related to clinical trial design could affect our ability to design and conduct clinical trials as planned. For example, we have conducted or will conduct clinical trials comparing our product candidates to both placebo and other approved drugs, but regulatory authorities may not allow us to compare our product candidates to a placebo in a particular clinical indication where products are available. In that case, both the cost and the amount of time required to conduct a clinical trial could increase. The FDA may disagree with our trial design and our interpretation of data from clinical trials, or may change the requirements for approval even after it has reviewed and commented on the design for our clinical trials. The FDA may also approve a product candidate for fewer or more limited indications than we request, or may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly post-approval clinical trials. In addition, the FDA may not approve the labeling claims that we believe are necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of our product candidates. Approval may be contingent on a post-marketing REMS, which could limit the labeling, distribution or promotion of a drug product.\nAny of these delays or additional requirements could cause our product candidates to not be approved, or if approved, significantly impact the timing and commercialization of our product candidates and significantly increase our overall costs of drug development.\nIf we are unable to conduct and complete clinical trials on schedule, or if there is a delay in the approval process, the cost of seeking necessary regulatory approvals will be significantly increased.\nThe clinical trial process consumes a significant amount of time. The length of clinical trials will depend upon, among other factors, the number of patients required to be enrolled in such studies and the rate of trial site and patient enrollment. We may fail to obtain adequate levels of patient enrollment in our clinical trials. Delays in planned patient enrollment may result in increased costs, delays or termination of clinical trials. In addition, even if we enroll the number of patients we expect in the time frame we expect, such clinical trials may not provide the data necessary to support regulatory approval for the product candidates for which they were conducted. In addition, we may fail to effectively oversee and monitor these clinical trials, which would result in increased costs or delays of our clinical trials. Even if these clinical trials are completed, we may fail to complete and submit an NDA or sNDA as scheduled.\nEven if clinical trials are completed as planned, their results may not support expectations or intended marketing claims. The clinical trials process may fail to demonstrate that our product candidates are safe and effective for indicated uses or could fail to support a labeling claim. Such failure may cause us to abandon a product candidate, could delay development of other product candidates or could cause us to abandon a labeling claim that we are seeking, or the FDA could require additional studies, in which case we would have to expend additional time and resources which would likely delay the date of potentially receiving regulatory approval. The approval process may also be delayed by changes in government regulation, future legislation or administrative action or changes in FDA policy that occur prior to or during our regulatory review. Delays in obtaining regulatory approvals would:\n\u00b7\ndelay commercialization of, and product revenues from, our product candidates; and\n\u00b7\ndiminish the competitive advantages that we may have otherwise enjoyed, which would have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nBecause the results of preclinical studies and early-stage clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of future results, any product candidate we advance into additional clinical trials may not continue to have favorable results or receive regulatory approval.\nSuccess in preclinical studies and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will generate adequate data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of an investigational drug. Many companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, including those with greater resources and experience, have suffered significant setbacks in clinical trials, even after reporting promising results in earlier clinical trials. We do not know whether the clinical trials we may conduct will demonstrate adequate efficacy and safety or otherwise provide adequate information to result in regulatory approval to market any of our product candidates in any particular jurisdiction. If later-stage clinical trials do not produce favorable results, our ability to achieve regulatory approval for any of our product candidates may be compromised.\nIf the FDA does not conclude that our product candidates are sufficiently bioequivalent, or have comparable bioavailability, to approved drugs, or if the FDA does not allow us to pursue the Section 505(b)(2) approval pathway as anticipated, the approval pathway for those product candidates will likely take significantly longer, cost significantly more and entail significantly greater complications and risks than anticipated, and the FDA may not approve those product candidates.\nA key element of our strategy with regard to any product candidate that we are able to partner is to seek FDA approval for our product candidates through the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway. Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. Such reliance is typically predicated on a showing of bioequivalence or comparable bioavailability to an approved drug.\nIf the FDA does not allow us to pursue the Section 505(b)(2) approval pathway for our product candidates, or if we cannot demonstrate bioequivalence or comparable bioavailability of our product candidates to products at a statistically significant level, we may need to conduct additional clinical trials, provide additional data and information,\nand meet additional standards for regulatory approval. If this were to occur, the time and financial resources required to obtain FDA approval for these product candidates, and complications and risks associated with these product candidates, would likely substantially increase. Moreover, our inability to pursue the Section 505(b)(2) approval pathway could result in new competitive products reaching the market more quickly than our product candidates, which could hurt our competitive position and our business prospects. Even if we are allowed to pursue the Section 505(b)(2) approval pathway, we cannot assure you that our product candidates will receive the requisite approvals for commercialization on a timely basis, if at all.\nIn addition, notwithstanding the approval of a number of products by the FDA under Section 505(b)(2) over the last few years, pharmaceutical companies and others have objected to the FDA\u2019s interpretation of Section 505(b)(2). If the FDA\u2019s interpretation of Section 505(b)(2) is successfully challenged, the FDA may change its policies and practices with respect to Section 505(b)(2) regulatory approvals, which could delay or even prevent the FDA from approving any NDA that we submit under Section 505(b)(2).\nEven if our product candidates are approved under Section 505(b)(2), the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the products may be marketed or to other conditions of approval, or may contain requirements for costly post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the products.\nOur decision to seek approval of our product candidates under Section 505(b)(2) may increase the risk that patent infringement suits are filed against us, which would delay the FDA\u2019s approval of such product candidates.\nIn connection with any NDA that we submit under Section 505(b)(2), we will also be required to notify the patent holder that we have certified to the FDA that any patents listed for the approved drug, also known as a reference listed drug, in the FDA\u2019s Orange Book publication are invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the manufacture, use or sale of our drug. If the patent holder files a patent infringement lawsuit against us within 45 days of its receipt of notice of our certification, the FDA is automatically prevented from approving our Section 505(b)(2) NDA until the earliest of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a court decision in the infringement case that is favorable to us. Accordingly, we may invest significant time and expense in the development of our product candidates only to be subject to significant delay and patent litigation before our product candidates may be commercialized. With regard to Egalet-002, we are aware of litigation involving the sponsor for the RLD for oxycodone and a number of generic manufacturers related to patents listed in the Orange Book that expire on various dates between 2017 and 2025. There is a risk that the sponsor for the RLD may bring an infringement claims against us. Even if we are found not to infringe, or a plaintiff\u2019s patent claims are found invalid or unenforceable, defending any such infringement claim would be expensive and time-consuming, and would delay launch of Egalet-002 and distract management from their normal responsibilities.\nConducting clinical trials for our products and product candidates and any commercial sales of our products or future sales of a product candidate may expose us to expensive product liability claims, and we may not be able to maintain product liability insurance on reasonable terms or at all.\nThe commercial use of our products and clinical use of our products and product candidates expose us to the risk of product liability claims. This risk exists even if a product is approved for commercial sale by the FDA and manufactured in facilities licensed and regulated by the FDA, such as the case with our products, or an applicable foreign regulatory authority.\nWe currently carry clinical trial and product liability insurance with coverage up to approximately $10 million. We may face product liability claims for our products and product candidates, regardless of FDA approval for commercial manufacturing and sale. Product liability claims may be brought against us by consumers, pharmaceutical companies, subjects enrolled in our clinical trials, patients, healthcare providers or others using, administering or selling our products. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that our products or product candidates caused injuries, we could incur substantial liabilities. We may not be able to obtain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in\nan amount adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u00b7\ndecreased demand for our products;\n\u00b7\ntermination of clinical trial sites or entire trial programs;\n\u00b7\ninjury to our reputation and significant negative media attention;\n\u00b7\nwithdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u00b7\nsignificant costs to defend the related litigation;\n\u00b7\nsubstantial monetary awards to trial subjects or patients;\n\u00b7\nloss of revenue;\n\u00b7\ndiversion of management and scientific resources from our business operations;\n\u00b7\nproduct recall or withdrawal from the market;\n\u00b7\nthe inability to commercialize any products that we may develop; and\n\u00b7\nan increase in product liability insurance premiums or an inability to maintain product liability insurance coverage.\nOur inability to obtain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable cost to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of our product candidates. Any agreements we may enter into in the future with collaborators in connection with the development or commercialization of our product candidates may entitle us to indemnification against product liability losses, but such indemnification may not be available or adequate should any claim arise.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Securities\nWe may fail to qualify for continued listing on Nasdaq, which could make it more difficult for our stockholders to sell their shares.\nOur common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the \u201cCommon Stock\u201d) is listed on The Nasdaq Global Market and therefore we are required to satisfy the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq for inclusion in the Global Market to maintain such listing, including, among other things, the maintenance of a minimum closing bid price of $1.00 per share and either (i) a market value of listed securities of at least $50 million, (ii) stockholders\u2019 equity of at least $10 million or (iii) total assets and total revenue in the most recent fiscal year (or two of the three most recent fiscal years) of at least $50 million. On November 24, 2017, we received a notice from Nasdaq that we were not in compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s Listing Rule 5450(b)(2)(A), as the minimum market value of our Common Stock was below $50 million for 30 consecutive business days. The notification of noncompliance had no immediate effect on the listing or trading of our Common Stock on the Global Market and we have 180 days, or until May 23, 2018, to achieve compliance with the minimum market value requirement. To regain compliance, the minimum market value of our Common Stock must meet or exceed $50 million for a minimum of ten consecutive business days during the 180-day grace period. Our failure to regain compliance during this period could result in delisting. In addition, on March 8, 2018, we received a notice from Nasdaq that were not in compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s Listing Rule 5450(a), as the minimum closing bid price for our Common Stock had been below $1.00 for 30 consecutive business days. We have 180 days, or until September 4, 2018, to achieve compliance with the minimum closing bid price requirement. To regain compliance, the closing bid price of\nour common stock must meet or exceed $1.00 for a minimum of ten consecutive business days during this 180-day grace period.\nIn the event that we do not regain compliance with the Nasdaq\u2019s Listing Rules prior to the expiration of the grace period, or fail to meeting any of Nasdaq\u2019s other continued listing requirements, we expect to receive written notification that our Common Stock is subject to delisting. If we receive such a delisting notification, we may either apply for listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market, provided we meet the continued listing requirements of that market, or appeal the decision to a Nasdaq Hearings Panel. In the event of an appeal, our Common Stock would remain listed on The Nasdaq Global Market pending a decision by the panel following the hearing. There can be no assurance that we will be able to regain compliance with the continued listing requirements. If our Common Stock is delisted by Nasdaq, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including:\n\u00b7\nholders of our 5.50% Notes could require us to repurchase the notes, including both principal and accrued interest, for cash if we are delisted from the Nasdaq Global Market and holders of our 6.50% Notes could require us to repurchase the notes for cash if we are delisted from Nasdaq entirely;\n\u00b7\na limited availability of market quotations for our Common Stock;\n\u00b7\nreduced liquidity with respect to our Common Stock;\n\u00b7\na determination that our shares are \u201cpenny stock,\u201d which will require brokers trading in our shares to adhere to more stringent shares, and which may limit demand for our Common Stock among certain investors;\n\u00b7\na limited amount of news and analyst coverage for our company; and\n\u00b7\na decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nWe are party to ongoing stockholder litigation, and in the future could be party to additional stockholder litigation, which is expensive and could harm our business, financial condition and operating results and could divert management attention.\nThe market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile, and in the past companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We have been and may be the target of this type of litigation in the future as a result of changes in our stock price, past transactions or other matters. Securities litigation against us, whether or not resolved in our favor, could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business or results of operations. For example, and as further described in Item 3, \u201cLegal Proceedings,\u201d and Note 13, \u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u201d to the financial statements accompanying this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we are currently defending two putative securities class actions that were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania on January 27, 2017 and February 10, 2017, respectively. On May 1, 2017, the Court entered an order consolidating the two cases before it and appointing a lead plaintiff. On July 3, 2017, the plaintiffs filed their consolidated amended complaint, which asserts claims for purported violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The plaintiffs brought their claims individually and on behalf of a putative class of all persons who purchased or otherwise acquired shares of the Company between November 4, 2015 and January 9, 2017 inclusive. The consolidated amended complaint bases its claims on allegedly false and/or misleading statements and/or failures to disclose information about the likelihood that ARYMO ER would be approved for intranasal abuse-deterrent labeling. The defendants moved to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint and after oral argument on the motion to dismiss on February 20, 2018, the Court entered an order pursuant to which the plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to file a second amended complaint on March 6, 2018. The defendants response is due on March 20, 2018. We cannot determine the likelihood of, nor can we reasonably estimate the range of, any potential loss, if any, from these lawsuits.\nWe may not be able to fully redeem the holders of our warrants if we experience a Fundamental Transaction.\nThe holders of our warrants may require us to redeem the warrants for cash if we experience certain \u201cFundamental Transaction\u201d (as defined in the warrants), which generally includes any reorganization, recapitalization or reclassification of our common stock, the sale, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all of our properties or assets, our consolidation or merger with or into another person, the acquisition of more than 50% of our outstanding common stock, or any person or group becoming the beneficial owner of 50% of the voting power represented by our\noutstanding common stock. There can be no assurance that in the event of a Fundamental Transaction we will be able to sufficiently compensate the holders of the warrants in accordance with the terms thereof. In addition, the provisions in the warrant related to Fundamental Transaction may delay a potential change of control even if such change may be beneficial to some or all our stockholders. These restrictions may also adversely affect the market price of shares of our common stock.\nFuture issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase common stock, including pursuant to our equity incentive plans or the exercise or our outstanding warrants, could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to fall.\nWe expect that significant additional capital will be needed in the future to continue our planned operations. To raise capital, we may sell substantial amounts of common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock. These future issuances of common stock or common stock-related securities, together with the exercise of outstanding options and any additional shares issued in connection with acquisitions, if any, may result in material dilution to our investors. Such sales may also result in material dilution to our existing stockholders, and new investors could gain rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock.\nPursuant to our 2013 Stock-Based Incentive Compensation Plan, as amended, or the 2013 Stock Plan, our compensation committee is authorized to grant equity-based incentive awards to our directors, executive officers and other employees and service providers, including officers, employees and service providers of our subsidiaries and affiliates. The number of shares of our common stock we have reserved for issuance under our 2013 Stock Plan is currently 6,280,000, and future option grants and issuances of common stock under our 2013 Stock Plan may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. In addition, in June 2016 our stockholders approved our Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or ESPP, and the reservation of 750,000 shares for issuance thereunder, and in December 2016, our Board adopted our 2017 Inducement Plan (the \u201cInducement Plan\u201d) and reserved 300,000 shares for issuance under the Inducement Plan for grants to new hires as an inducement for them to join the Company in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(c)(4).\nIn our July 2017 equity offering, we sold our Common Stock and warrants to purchase our Common Stock. The warrants also contain anti-dilution provisions, which provide that any new issuances of Common Stock or securities convertible into Common Stock at a price, exercise price or conversion price below those of the warrants will result in the exercise price of the warrants being reduced based upon the number of securities issues in such issuance and the number of shares of our Common Stock then outstanding, which could cause further dilution.\nFurther, our 6.50% Notes are convertible into shares of our Common Stock at any time, and our 5.50% Notes are convertible into shares of our Common Stock under certain specified circumstances, each of which could result in additional issuances of shares and cause further dilution.\nOur share price has been and may continue to be volatile, which could subject us to securities class action litigation and result in substantial losses to our stockholders.\nThe trading price of our common stock is highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. In addition to the factors discussed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and elsewhere in this Annual Report, these factors include:\n\u00b7\nthe success of competitive products or technologies;\n\u00b7\nregulatory actions with respect to our products or our competitors\u2019 products, including regulatory decisions regarding the content of the labels for our products or our competitors\u2019 products;\n\u00b7\nactual or anticipated changes in our growth rate relative to our competitors;\n\u00b7\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, collaborations or capital commitments;\n\u00b7\nannouncements related to third-party payor arrangements;\n\u00b7\nactions taken by third-party payors to reduce the utilization of opioids;\n\u00b7\nresults of clinical trials of our product candidates or those of our competitors;\n\u00b7\nregulatory or legal developments in the United States and other countries;\n\u00b7\ndevelopments or disputes concerning patent applications, issued patents or other proprietary rights;\n\u00b7\nthe recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u00b7\nthe level of expenses related to any of our product candidates or clinical development programs;\n\u00b7\nthe results of our efforts to in-license or acquire additional product candidates or products;\n\u00b7\nactual or anticipated changes in estimates as to financial results, development timelines or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u00b7\nvariations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u00b7\nfluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;\n\u00b7\nshare price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares;\n\u00b7\nannouncement or expectation of additional financing efforts;\n\u00b7\nsales of our common stock by us, our insiders or our other stockholders;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the structure of healthcare payment systems;\n\u00b7\nthe receipt of a going concern opinion;\n\u00b7\nmarket conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors; and\n\u00b7\ngeneral economic, industry and market conditions.\nIf any of these risks occurs, our stock price may fall and we may be exposed to class action lawsuits that, even if unsuccessful, could be costly to defend and distracting to management. For example, as discussed above and as further described in Item 3, \u201cLegal Proceedings,\u201d and Note 13, \u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u201d to the financial statements accompanying this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we are currently defending two putative securities class actions that were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania on January 27, 2017 and February 10, 2017, respectively, that were consolidated on May 1, 2017. We cannot determine the likelihood of, nor can we reasonably estimate the range of, any potential loss, if any, from these lawsuits.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. The realization of any of the above risks or any of a broad range of other risks, including those described in these \u201cRisk Factors,\u201d could have a dramatic and material adverse impact on the market price of our common stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. There can be no assurance that analysts will continue to cover us or provide favorable coverage. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or change their opinion of our stock, our share price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our share price or trading volume to decline.\nActual or potential sales of our common stock by our directors or employees, including our executive officers, pursuant to pre-arranged stock trading plans could cause our stock price to fall or prevent it from increasing for numerous reasons, and actual or potential sales by such persons could be viewed negatively by investors.\nIn accordance with the guidelines specified under Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act and our policies regarding stock transactions, our directors and employees, including our executive officers, have adopted and may in the future adopt stock trading plans pursuant to which they may sell shares of our common stock from time to time in the future. Generally, sales under such plans by our executive officers and directors require public filings. Actual or potential sales of our common stock by such persons could cause the market price of our common stock to fall or prevent it from increasing for numerous reasons. For example, actual or potential sales by such persons could be viewed negatively by investors.\nSome provisions of our charter documents and Delaware law have anti-takeover effects that could discourage an acquisition of us by others, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire us or increase the cost of acquiring us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders, or remove our current management. These provisions include:\n\u00b7\nauthorizing the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval;\n\u00b7\nprohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors, which would otherwise allow for less than a majority of stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u00b7\nprohibiting stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n\u00b7\neliminating the ability of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders;\n\u00b7\nestablishing a staggered board of directors; and\n\u00b7\nestablishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, who are responsible for appointing the members of our management.\nBecause we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may also discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us or merging with us whether or not it is desired by or beneficial to our stockholders. Under Delaware law, a corporation may not, in general, engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held\nthe stock for three years or, among other things, the board of directors has approved the transaction. Any provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\nBecause we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, will be your sole source of gain.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain all of our future earnings, if any, to finance the growth and development of our business. In addition, the terms of any future debt agreements may preclude us from paying dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, with certain limited exceptions, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for any stockholder (including any beneficial owner) to bring (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty owed by any director or officer of the Company owed to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law or our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim against the Company governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in each case subject to the Court of Chancery having personal jurisdiction of the indispensable parties named as defendants. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock is deemed to have received notice of and consented to the foregoing provisions. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find this choice of forum provision inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.", "PERMNO": 14455, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "ZCOR"}
