{"cik": "1309402", "company": "Green Plains Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nWe operate in an industry that has numerous risks, many of which are beyond our control or are driven by factors that cannot always be predicted. Investors should carefully consider all of the risk factors in conjunction with the other information included in this report as our financial results and condition or market value could be adversely affected if any of these risks were to occur.\nRisks Related to our Business and Industry\nOur margins are dependent on managing the spread between the price of corn, natural gas, ethanol, including industrial-grade alcohol, distillers grains, Ultra-High Protein and corn oil.\nOur operating results are highly sensitive to commodity prices, including the spread between the corn and natural gas we purchase, and the ethanol, including industrial-grade alcohol, distillers grains, Ultra-High Protein and corn oil we sell. Price and supply are subject to various market forces, such as weather, domestic and global demand, shortages, export prices, crude oil prices, currency valuations and government policies in the United States and around the world, over which we have no control. Price volatility of these commodities may cause our operating results to fluctuate substantially. Increases in corn or natural gas prices or decreases in ethanol, including industrial-grade alcohol, distillers grains, Ultra-High Protein and corn oil prices may make it unprofitable to operate. No assurance can be given that we will purchase corn and natural gas or sell ethanol, including industrial-grade alcohol, distillers grains, Ultra-High Protein and corn oil at or near prices which would provide us with positive margins. Consequently, our results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected by increases in corn or natural gas prices or decreases in ethanol, including industrial-grade alcohol, distillers grains, Ultra-High Protein and corn oil prices.\nWe continuously monitor the margins at our ethanol plants using a variety of risk management tools and hedging strategies, when appropriate. In recent years, the spread between ethanol and corn prices has fluctuated widely, narrowed significantly and been negative at times. Fluctuations are likely to continue. A sustained narrow spread or further reduction in the spread between ethanol and corn prices as a result of increased corn prices or decreased ethanol prices, would adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. Should our combined revenue from ethanol, including industrial-grade alcohol, distillers grains, Ultra-High Protein and corn oil fall below our cost of production, we could decide to slow or\nsuspend production at some or all of our ethanol plants, which also could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.\nThe commodities we buy and sell are subject to price volatility and uncertainty.\nCorn. We are generally unable to pass increased corn costs to our customers since ethanol competes with other fuels. At certain corn prices, ethanol may be uneconomical to produce. Ethanol plants, livestock industries and other corn-consuming enterprises put significant price pressure on local corn markets. In addition, local corn supplies and prices could be adversely affected by prices for alternative crops, increasing input costs, changes in government policies, shifts in global markets or damaging growing conditions, such as plant disease or adverse weather, including drought.\nEthanol. Our revenues are dependent on market prices for ethanol which can be volatile as a result of a number of factors, including: the price and availability of competing fuels; the overall supply and demand for ethanol and corn; the price of gasoline, crude oil and corn; and government policies.\nEthanol is marketed as a fuel additive that reduces vehicle emissions, an economical source of octanes and, to a lesser extent, a gasoline substitute. Consequently, gasoline supply and demand affect the price of ethanol. Should gasoline prices or demand decrease significantly, our results of operations could be materially impacted.\nEthanol imports also affect domestic supply and demand. Imported ethanol is not subject to an import tariff and, under the RFS II, sugarcane ethanol from Brazil is one of the most economical means for obligated parties to meet the advanced biofuel standard.\nIndustrial-grade alcohol is produced by further distillation processing of the 200-proof alcohol. Further distillation removes impurities from fuel-grade ethanol to allow for production of industrial-grade alcohol which can be used as an ingredient for sanitation products. Should industrial-grade alcohol prices or demand decrease significantly, our results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nDistillers Grains. Increased U.S. dry mill ethanol production has resulted in increased distillers grains production. Should this trend continue, distillers grains prices could fall unless demand increases or other market sources are found. The price of distillers grains has historically been correlated with the price of corn. Occasionally, the price of distillers grains will lag behind fluctuations in corn or other feedstock prices, lowering our cost recovery percentage. Additionally, exports of distiller grains could be impacted by the enactment of foreign policy.\nDistillers grains compete with other protein-based animal feed products. Downward pressure on other commodity prices, such as corn and soybeans, will generally cause the price of competing animal feed products to decline, resulting in downward pressure on the price of distillers grains.\nNatural Gas. The price and availability of natural gas are subject to volatile market conditions. These market conditions are often affected by factors beyond our control, such as weather, drilling economics, overall economic conditions and government regulations. Significant disruptions in natural gas supply could impair our ability to produce ethanol. Furthermore, increases in natural gas price or changes in our cost relative to our competitors cannot be passed on to our customers which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.\nCorn Oil. Industrial corn oil is generally marketed as a renewable diesel and biodiesel feedstock; therefore, the price of corn oil is affected by demand for renewable diesel and biodiesel. Expanded profitability in the renewable diesel and biodiesel industry due to the extended blending tax credit and low carbon fuels standards could impact corn oil demand. In general, corn oil prices follow the prices of heating oil and soybean oil. Decreases in the price of corn oil could have an unfavorable impact on our business.\nOur risk management and commodity trading strategies could be ineffective and expose us to decreased liquidity.\nAs market conditions warrant, we use forward contracts to sell some of our ethanol, distillers grains, Ultra-High Protein, and corn oil, or buy some of the corn, and natural gas we need to partially offset commodity price volatility. We also engage in other hedging transactions and other commodity trading involving exchange-traded futures contracts for corn, natural gas, ethanol, soybean meal and other agricultural commodities. The financial impact of these activities depends on the price of the commodities involved and/or our ability to physically receive or deliver the commodities.\nHedging arrangements expose us to risk of financial loss when the counterparty defaults on its contract or, in the case of exchange-traded contracts, when the expected differential between the price of the underlying and physical commodity\nchanges. Hedging activities can result in losses when a position is purchased in a declining market or sold in a rising market. Hedging losses may be offset by a decreased cash price for corn, and natural gas and an increased cash price for ethanol, distillers grains, Ultra-High Protein and corn oil. We vary the amount of hedging and other risk mitigation strategies we undertake and sometimes choose not to engage in hedging transactions at all. We cannot provide assurance that our risk management and commodity trading strategies and decisions will be profitable or effectively offset commodity price volatility. If they are not our results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected.\nThe use of derivative financial instruments frequently involves cash deposits with brokers, or margin calls. Sudden changes in commodity prices may require additional cash deposits immediately. Depending on our open derivative positions, we may need additional liquidity with little advance notice to cover margin calls. While we continuously monitor our exposure to margin calls, we cannot guarantee we will be able to maintain adequate liquidity to cover margin calls in the future.\nGovernment mandates affecting ethanol could change and impact the ethanol market.\nUnder the provisions of the Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA), Congress expanded the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS II). The RFS II mandated the minimum volume of renewable fuels that must be blended into the transportation fuel supply which affects the domestic market for ethanol and each year, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) undertakes rulemaking to set the Renewable Volume Obligation (RVO) for the following year. Further, the EPA has the authority to waive the requirements, in whole or in part, if there is inadequate domestic renewable fuel supply or the requirement severely harms the economy or the environment. After 2022, volumes shall be determined by the EPA in coordination with the Secretaries of Energy and Agriculture, taking into account such factors as impact on environment, energy security, future rates of production, cost to consumers, infrastructure, and other factors such as impact on commodity prices, job creation, rural economic development, or impact on food prices. However, on December 19, 2019, the EPA announced it would not be moving forward with a reset rulemaking in 2020. It is unclear when or if they will propose a reset rulemaking. Volumes can also be impacted as small refineries can petition the EPA for a SRE which, if approved, waives their portion of the annual RVO requirements. The EPA, through consultation with the DOE and the USDA can grant them a full or partial waiver, or deny it outright within 90 days of submittal. A small refinery is defined as one that processes fewer than 75,000 barrels of petroleum per day.\n\ufeff\nOur operations could be adversely impacted by legislation, administration actions, EPA actions, or lawsuits, that may reduce the RFS II mandated volumes of conventional ethanol and other biofuels through the annual RVO, the 2022 reset rulemaking, the point of obligation for blending, or small refinery exemptions. A number of lawsuits are pending involving the RVO, the point of obligation and small refinery exemptions. Similarly, should federal mandates regarding oxygenated gasoline be repealed, the market for domestic ethanol could be adversely impacted. Economic incentives to blend based on the relative value of gasoline versus ethanol, taking into consideration the octane value of ethanol, environmental requirements and the RFS II mandate, may affect future demand. A significant increase in supply beyond the RFS II mandate could have an adverse impact on ethanol prices. Moreover, changes to RFS II could negatively impact the price of ethanol or cause imported sugarcane ethanol to become more economical than domestic ethanol. Likewise state and regional low carbon fuel standards (LCFS) like that of California could be favorable or harmful to conventional ethanol, depending on how it is crafted.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff \ufeff Future demand may be influenced by economic incentives to blend based on the relative value of gasoline versus ethanol, taking into consideration the octane value of ethanol, environmental requirements and the value of RFS II credits or Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs). A significant increase in supply beyond the RFS II mandate could have an adverse impact on ethanol prices. Moreover, any changes to RFS II, whether by legislation, EPA action or lawsuit, originating from issues associated with the market price of RINs could negatively impact the demand for ethanol, discretionary blending of ethanol and/or the price of ethanol. Recent actions by the EPA to grant small refiner exemptions without accounting for the lost gallons has resulted in lower RIN prices.\nFlexible-fuel vehicles (FFVs), which are designed to run on a mixture of fuels, including higher blends of ethanol such as E85, receive preferential treatment to meet corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards in the form of CAFE credits. There are approximately 21 million FFVs on the road in the U.S. today, 16 million of which are light duty trucks. FFV credits have been decreasing since 2014 and will be completely phased out in 2020. Absent CAFE preferences, auto manufacturers may not be willing to build flexible-fuel vehicles, which has the potential to slow the growth of E85 markets.\n\ufeff\nTo the extent federal or state laws or regulations are modified and/or enacted, it may result in the demand for ethanol being reduced, which could negatively and materially affect our financial performance.\nFuture demand for ethanol is uncertain and changes in public perception, consumer acceptance and overall consumer demand for transportation fuel could affect demand.\nWhile many trade groups, academics and government agencies support ethanol as a fuel additive that promotes a cleaner environment, others claim ethanol production consumes considerably more energy, emits more greenhouse gases than other fuels and depletes water resources. While we do not agree, some studies suggest ethanol produced from corn is less efficient than ethanol produced from switch grass or wheat grain. Others claim corn-based ethanol negatively impacts consumers by causing the prices of meat and other food derived from corn-consuming livestock to increase. Ethanol critics also contend the industry redirects corn supplies from international food markets to domestic fuel markets, and contributes to land use change domestically and abroad.\nThere are limited markets for ethanol beyond the federal mandates. We believe further consumer acceptance of E15 and E85 fuels may be necessary before ethanol can achieve significant market share growth. Discretionary and E85 blending are important secondary markets. Discretionary blending is often determined by the price of ethanol relative to gasoline, and availability to consumers. When discretionary blending is financially unattractive, the demand for ethanol may be reduced.\nDemand for ethanol is also affected by overall demand for transportation fuel, which is affected by cost, number of miles traveled and vehicle fuel economy. Miles traveled typically increases during the spring and summer months related to vacation travel, followed closely behind the fall season due to holiday travel. Global events, such as COVID-19, have greatly decreased miles traveled and in turn, the demand for ethanol. Consumer demand for gasoline may be impacted by emerging transportation trends, such as electric vehicles or ride sharing. In January 2021, General Motors announced a target date of 2035 for phasing out the production of gasoline and diesel powered vehicles. Similarly, Nissan has stated that their entire fleet will be electric vehicles by the early 2030s. These announcements coincide with pledges to ban the sale of internal combustion engines in countries such as Japan and the United Kingdom by 2035, as well as a statewide ban in California. While aspirational, if realized these bans would accelerate the decline of liquid fuel demand and by extension demand for ethanol, biodiesel and renewable diesel.\nAdditionally, factors such as over-supply of ethanol, which has been the case for some time, could continue to negatively impact our business. Reduced demand for ethanol may depress the value of our products, erode its margins, and reduce our ability to generate revenue or operate profitably.\nOur business is directly affected by the supply and demand for ethanol and other fuels in the markets served by our assets. Reduced demand for ethanol, regardless of cause, may erode our margins and reduce our ability to generate revenue and operate profitably.\nIn the past, we have had operating losses and could incur future operating losses.\nIn the last five years, we incurred operating losses during certain quarters and could incur operating losses in the future that are substantial. Although we have had periods of sustained profitability, we may not be able to maintain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis, which could impact the market price of our common stock and the value of your investment.\nIf the United States were to withdraw from or materially modify certain international trade agreements, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nEthanol and other products that we produce are or have been exported to Canada, Mexico, Brazil, China and other countries. The previous administration expressed antipathy towards certain existing international trade agreements and has significantly increased tariffs on goods imported into the United States, which in turn has led to retaliatory actions on U.S. exports. The current trade situation, the outcome of trade negotiations or lack thereof, has had and/or may continue to have a material effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to access the partnership\u2019s terminals adjacent to our ethanol plants could cause disruptions in our operations and adversely affect our production levels, profitability and needed capital expenditures.\nWe are party to the storage and throughput agreement with our partnership, under which we access the storage and throughput services offered by the partnership. In the event of a default by either party under that agreement, our ability to throughput our ethanol may be disrupted, which in turn could adversely affect our production levels, operating expenses, profitability and our need for capital expenditures for alternative throughput arrangements.\n\u200e\nOur debt exposes us to numerous risks that could have significant consequences to our shareholders.\nRisks related to the level of debt we have include: (1) requiring a sizeable portion of cash to be dedicated for debt service, reducing the availability of cash flow for working capital, capital expenditures, and other general business activities and limiting our ability to invest in new growth opportunities; (2) limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other activities; (3) limiting our flexibility to plan for or react to changes in the businesses and industries in which we operate; (4) increasing our vulnerability to general and industry-specific adverse economic conditions; (5) being at a competitive disadvantage against less leveraged competitors; and (6) being vulnerable to increases in prevailing interest rates.\nMost of our debt bears interest at variable rates, which creates exposure to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations at variable rates would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, decreasing net income.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations and to fund our planned capital expenditures, acquisitions and other ongoing liquidity needs depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions as well as certain financial, business and other factors which are beyond our control. There can be no assurance that we will maintain a level of cash flow from operating activities in an amount sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness. If our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to seek additional capital or restructure our indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations.\nWe are required to comply with a number of covenants under our existing loan agreements that could hinder our growth.\nWe are required to maintain specified financial ratios, including minimum cash flow coverage, working capital and tangible net worth under certain loan agreements. A breach of these covenants could result in default, and if such default is not cured or waived, our lenders could accelerate our debt and declare it immediately due and payable. If this occurs, we may not be able to repay or borrow sufficient funds to refinance the debt. Even if financing is available, it may not be on acceptable terms. No assurance can be given that our future operating results will be sufficient to comply with these covenants or remedy default.\nIn the past, we have received waivers from our lenders for failure to meet certain financial covenants and amended our loan agreements to change these covenants. In the event we are unable to comply with these covenants in the future, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to obtain the necessary waivers or amend our loan agreements to prevent default. Under our convertible senior notes, default on any loan in excess of $10.0 million could result in the notes being declared due and payable, which would have a material and adverse effect on our ability to operate.\nWe operate in a capital intensive business and rely on cash generated from operations and external financing, which could be limited.\nIncreased commodity prices could increase liquidity requirements. Our operating cash flow is dependent on overall commodity market conditions as well as our ability to operate profitably. In addition, we may need to raise additional financing to fund growth. In some market environments, we may have limited access to incremental financing, which could defer or cancel growth projects, reduce business activity or cause us to default on our existing debt agreements if we are unable to meet our payment schedules. These events could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial position.\nOur ability to repay current and anticipated future debt will depend on our financial and operating performance and successful implementation of our business strategies. Our financial and operational performance will depend on numerous factors including prevailing economic conditions, commodity prices, and financial, business and other factors beyond our control. If we cannot repay, refinance or extend our current debt at scheduled maturity dates, we could be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, restructure our debt or seek additional capital. If we are unable to restructure our debt or raise funds, our operations and growth plans could be harmed and the value of our stock could be significantly reduced.\n\u200e\nDisruptions in the credit market could limit our access to capital.\nWe may need additional capital to fund our growth or other business activities in the future. The cost of capital under our existing or future financing arrangements could increase and affect our ability to trade with various commercial counterparties or cause our counterparties to require additional forms of credit support. If capital markets are disrupted, we may not be able to access capital at all or capital may only be available under less favorable terms.\nWe are required to continue to make payments to the partnership to the minimum volume commitment regardless of our production levels.\nWe are party to the storage and throughput agreement with our partnership, under which we are obligated to pay a minimum volume commitment regardless of whether or not we operate. We may not run our plants at volumes sufficient enough to cover the MVC resulting in payments being made to the partnership. In times of sustained negative margins, our volumes may be insufficient to recover these MVC payments in the following four quarters as outlined in the partnership agreement.\nOur ability to maintain the required regulatory permits or manage changes in environmental, safety and TTB regulations is essential to successfully operating our plants.\nOur plants are subject to extensive air, water, environmental and TTB regulations. Our production facilities involve the emission of various airborne pollutants, including particulate, carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, hazardous air pollutants and volatile organic compounds, which requires numerous environmental permits to operate our plants. Governing state agencies could impose costly conditions or restrictions that are detrimental to our profitability and have a material adverse effect on our operations, cash flows and financial position.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations at the federal and state level are subject to change. These changes can also be made retroactively. It is possible that more stringent federal or state environmental rules or regulations could be adopted, which could increase our operating costs and expenses. Consequently, even though we currently have the proper permits, we may be required to invest or spend considerable resources in order to comply with future environmental regulations. Furthermore, ongoing plant operations, which are governed by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, may change in a way that increases the cost of plant operations. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our operations, cash flows and financial position.\nPart of our business is regulated by environmental laws and regulations governing the labeling, use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous materials. Since we handle and use hazardous substances, changes in environmental requirements or an unanticipated significant adverse environmental event could have a negative impact on our business. While we strive to comply with all environmental requirements, we cannot provide assurance that we have been in compliance at all times or will not incur material costs or liabilities in connection with these requirements. Private parties, including current and former employees, could bring personal injury or other claims against us due to the presence of hazardous substances. We are also exposed to residual risk by our land and facilities which may have environmental liabilities from prior use. Changes in environmental regulations may require us to modify existing plant and processing facilities, which could significantly increase our cost of operations.\nTTB regulations apply when producing our undenatured ethanol. These regulations carry substantial penalties for non-compliance and therefore any non-compliance may adversely affect our financial operations or adversely impact our ability to produce undenatured ethanol.\nAny inability to generate or obtain RINs could adversely affect our operating margins.\nNearly all of our ethanol production is sold with RINs that are used by our customers to comply with the RFS II. Should our production not meet the EPA\u2019s requirements for RIN generation in the future, we would need to purchase RINs in the open market or sell our ethanol at lower prices to compensate for the absence of RINs. The price of RINs depends on a variety of factors, including the availability of qualifying biofuels and RINs for purchase, production levels of transportation fuel and percentage mix of ethanol with other fuels, and cannot be predicted. Failure to obtain sufficient RINs or reliance on invalid RINs could subject us to fines and penalties imposed by the EPA which could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nAs we trade ethanol acquired from third-parties, should it be discovered the RINs associated with the ethanol we purchased are invalid, albeit unknowingly, we could be subject to substantial penalties if we are assessed the maximum amount allowed by law. Prior to 2013, the EPA assessed only modest penalties for RIN violations. However, based on EPA\npenalties assessed on RINS violations in the past few years, in the event of a violation, the EPA could assess penalties, which could have an adverse impact on our profitability.\nCompliance with evolving environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, particularly those related to climate change, could be costly.\nOur plants emit carbon dioxide as a by-product of ethanol production. In February 2010, the EPA released its final regulations on RFS II, grandfathering our plants at their current authorized capacity. While some of our plants have received efficient producer status and no longer rely on grandfathered status, for those still reliant upon it, expansion above these levels will require a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from the 2005 baseline measurement. Separately, CARB adopted a LCFS that took effect in January 2013, which requires a 10% reduction in the average carbon intensity of gasoline and diesel transportation fuels from 2010 to 2020. An ILUC component is included in the greenhouse gas emission calculation, which may have an adverse impact on the market for corn-based ethanol in California.\nTo expand our production capacity, federal and state regulations may require us to obtain additional permits, achieve EPA\u2019s efficient producer status under the pathway petition program, install advanced technology or reduce drying distillers grains. Compliance with future laws or regulations to decrease carbon dioxide could be costly and may prevent us from operating our plants as profitably, which may have an adverse impact on our operations, cash flows and financial position.\nWe may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures or partnerships.\nWe have increased the size and diversity of our operations through mergers, acquisitions and joint ventures or partnerships and intend to continue exploring potential growth opportunities. Acquisitions involve numerous risks that could harm our business, including: (1) difficulties integrating the operations, technologies, products, existing contracts, accounting processes and personnel and realizing anticipated synergies of the combined business; (2) risks relating to environmental hazards on purchased sites; (3) risks relating to developing the necessary infrastructure for facilities or acquired sites, including access to rail networks; (4) difficulties supporting and transitioning customers; (5) diversion of financial and management resources from existing operations; (6) the purchase price exceeding the value realized; (7) risks of entering new markets or areas outside of our core competencies; (7) potential loss of key employees, customers and strategic alliances from our existing or acquired business; (8) unanticipated problems or underlying liabilities; and (9) inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition and development costs.\nThe anticipated benefits of these transactions may not be fully realized or could take longer to realize than expected.\nWe have also pursued growth through joint ventures or partnerships, which typically involve restrictions on actions that the partnership or joint venture may take without the approval of the partners. These provisions could limit our ability to manage the partnership or joint venture in a manner that serves our best interests.\nFuture acquisitions may involve issuing equity as payment or to finance the business or assets, which could dilute your ownership interest. Furthermore, additional debt may be necessary to complete these transactions, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Failure to adequately address the risks associated with acquisitions or joint ventures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be affected by our portfolio optimization and total transformation strategies.\nIn May 2018, we announced that we were evaluating the performance of our entire portfolio of assets and businesses. As part of that process, during the fourth quarter of 2018, we sold three ethanol plants, permanently closed one ethanol plant and sold Fleischmann\u2019s Vinegar. Furthermore, we sold our 50% interest in JGP Energy Partners during the fourth quarter of 2019, we sold a 50% interest in GPCC during the third quarter of 2019 and the remaining 50% interest in GPCC during the fourth quarter of 2020, the Hereford, Texas ethanol plant in December 2020 and the recently announced sale of the Ord, Nebraska ethanol plant, which is expected to close within 45 days.\nAs we continue to evaluate our portfolio, we may sell additional assets or businesses or exit particular markets that are no longer a strategic fit or no longer meet their growth or profitability targets. Depending on the nature of the assets sold, our profitability may be impacted by lost operating income or cash flows from such businesses. In addition, divestitures we complete may not yield the targeted improvements in our business and may divert management\u2019s attention from our day-to-day operations. We are also undergoing a number of project initiatives to improve margins, including the Project 24 initiative and increased investment into Ultra-High Protein animal feed products, as part of our total transformation strategy. Our failure to achieve the intended financial results associated with our portfolio optimization and total transformation strategies could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nFuture events could result in impairment of long-lived assets, which may result in charges that adversely affect our results of operations.\nLong-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, goodwill and equity method investments, are evaluated for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Our impairment evaluations are sensitive to changes in key assumptions used in our analysis and may require use of financial estimates of future cash flows. Application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results. We may be required to recognize impairments of long-lived assets based on future economic factors such as unfavorable changes in estimated future undiscounted cash flows of an asset group.\nGlobal competition could affect our profitability.\nWe compete with producers in the United States and abroad. Depending on feedstock, labor and other production costs, producers in other countries, such as Brazil, may be able to produce ethanol cheaper than we can. Under RFS II, certain parties are obligated to meet an advanced biofuel standard. In recent years, sugarcane ethanol imported from Brazil has been one of the most economical means for obligated parties to meet this standard. While transportation costs, infrastructure constraints and demand may temper the impact of ethanol imports, foreign competition remains a risk to our business. Moreover, significant additional foreign ethanol production could create excess supply, which could result in lower ethanol prices throughout the world, including the United States. Any penetration of ethanol imports into the domestic market may have a material adverse effect on our operations, cash flows and financial position.\nInternational activities such as boycotts, embargoes, product rejection, trade policies and compliance matters, may have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nGovernment actions abroad can have a significant impact on our business. In 2020, we exported 21% of our ethanol production. In 2013, the European Union imposed a five-year tariff of $83.33 per metric ton on U.S. ethanol to discourage foreign competition. Effective January 1, 2017, China indicated its intention to raise its 5% tariff on U.S. and Brazil fuel ethanol to 30%. On April 1, 2018, China raised their tariff rate to 45%, and later raised it further to 70%. In January 2020, the two countries announced a \u201cPhase I\u201d trade deal with agricultural commodity purchase commitments, including ethanol; however, these ethanol tariffs have not been reduced or eliminated.\nAlthough the ethanol export markets are affected by competition from other ethanol exporters, particularly Brazil, and in spite of the actions by China, we believe exports will remain active going forward. On September 1, 2017, Brazil\u2019s Chamber of Foreign Trade, or CAMEX, issued an official written resolution, imposing a 20% tariff on U.S. ethanol imports in excess of 150 million liters, or 39.6 million gallons per quarter. The ruling was extended for a year in 2019, and again by 90 days in 2020, but was allowed to lapse in December 2020, and a 20% duty now applies to all U.S. ethanol imports into Brazil.\nIn January 2016, China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce initiated an anti-dumping investigation into U.S.-produced dried distillers grains exported to China. In January of 2017, the Ministry of Commerce of China announced it increased anti-dumping duties on U.S. distillers grains, ranging from 42.2% to 53.7%.\nWith more tariffs and reduced exports, the value of our products may be affected, which could have a negative impact on our profitability. Additionally, tariffs on U.S. ethanol may lead to further industry over-supply and reduce our profitability. Moreover, the America First trade position has caused more countries to toughen their positions on U.S. imports.\nThe ability or willingness of OPEC and other oil exporting nations to set and maintain production levels has a significant impact on oil and natural gas commodity prices.\nThe Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies (collectively, OPEC+), is an intergovernmental organization that seeks to manage the price and supply of oil on the global energy market. Actions taken by OPEC+ members, including those taken alongside other oil exporting nations, have a significant impact on global oil supply and pricing. For example, OPEC+ and certain other oil exporting nations have previously agreed to take measures, including production cuts, to support crude oil prices. In March 2020, members of OPEC+ considered extending and potentially increasing these oil production cuts, however these negotiations were unsuccessful. As a result, Saudi Arabia announced an immediate reduction in export prices and Russia announced that all previously agreed oil production cuts will expire on April 1, 2020. These actions led to an immediate and steep decrease in oil prices. There can be no assurance that OPEC+ members and other oil exporting nations will agree to future production cuts or other actions to support and stabilize oil prices, nor can there be any assurance that they will not further reduce oil prices or increase production. Uncertainty regarding future actions\nto be taken by OPEC+ members or other oil exporting countries could lead to increased volatility in the price of oil, which could adversely affect our business, future financial condition and results of operations.\nIncreased ethanol industry penetration by oil and other multinational companies could impact our margins.\nWe operate in a very competitive environment and compete with other domestic ethanol producers in a relatively fragmented industry. The top five producers account for approximately 40% of the domestic production capacity with production capacity ranging from 800 mmgy to 1,800 mmgy. The remaining ethanol producers consist of smaller entities engaged exclusively in ethanol production and large integrated grain companies that produce ethanol in addition to their base grain businesses. We compete for capital, labor, corn and other resources with these companies.\nUntil recently, oil companies, petrochemical refiners and gasoline retailers were not engaged in ethanol production even though they form the primary distribution network for ethanol blended with gasoline. Over the past decade, several oil refiners have acquired ethanol production plants, and now account for almost 1/5 of domestic ethanol production. If these companies increase their ethanol plant ownership or additional companies commence production, the need to purchase ethanol from independent producers like us could diminish and adversely effect on our operations, cash flows and financial position.\nOur agribusiness operations are subject to significant government regulations.\nOur agribusiness operations are regulated by various government entities that can impose significant costs on our business. Failure to comply could result in additional expenditures, fines or criminal action. Our production levels, markets and grains we merchandise are affected by federal government programs, which include USDA acreage control and price support programs. Government policies such as tariffs, duties, subsidies, import and export restrictions and embargos can also impact our business. Changes in government policies and producer support could impact the type and amount of grains planted, which could affect our ability to buy grain. Export restrictions or tariffs could limit sales opportunities outside of the United States.\nCommodities futures trading is subject to extensive regulations.\nThe futures industry is subject to extensive regulation. Since we use exchange-traded futures contracts as part of our business, we are required to comply with a wide range of requirements imposed by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, National Futures Association and the exchanges on which we trade. These regulatory bodies are responsible for safeguarding the integrity of the futures markets and protecting the interests of market participants. As a market participant, we are subject to regulation concerning trade practices, business conduct, reporting, position limits, record retention, the conduct of our officers and employees, and other matters.\nFailure to comply with the laws, rules or regulations applicable to futures trading could have adverse consequences. Such claims could result in fines, settlements or suspended trading privileges, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or operating results.\nOur success depends on our ability to manage our growing and changing operations.\nSince our formation in 2004, our business has grown significantly in size, products and complexity. This growth places substantial demands on our management, systems, internal controls, and financial and physical resources. If we acquire additional operations, we may need to further develop our financial and managerial controls and reporting systems, and could incur expenses related to hiring additional qualified personnel and expanding our information technology infrastructure. Our ability to manage growth effectively could impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nReplacement technologies could make corn-based ethanol or our process technology obsolete.\nEthanol is used primarily as an octane additive and oxygenate blended with gasoline. Critics of ethanol blends argue that it decreases fuel economy, causes corrosion and damages fuel pumps. Prior to federal restrictions and ethanol mandates, methyl tertiary-butyl ether, or MTBE, was the leading oxygenate. Other oxygenate products could enter the market and prove to be environmentally or economically superior to ethanol. Alternative biofuel alcohols, such as methanol and butanol, could evolve and replace ethanol.\nResearch is currently underway to develop products and processes that have advantages over ethanol, such as: lower vapor pressure, making it easier to add to gasoline; similar energy content as gasoline, reducing any decrease in fuel economy caused by blending with gasoline; ability to blend at higher concentration levels in standard vehicles; and reduced\nsusceptibility to separation when water is present. Products offering a competitive advantage over ethanol could reduce our ability to generate revenue and profits from ethanol production.\nNew ethanol process technologies could emerge that require less energy per gallon to produce and result in lower production costs. Our process technologies could become obsolete and place us at a competitive disadvantage, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, cash flows and financial position.\nWe may be required to provide remedies for ethanol, including industrial-grade alcohol, distillers grains, Ultra-High Protein or corn oil that does not meet the specifications defined in our sales contracts.\nIf we produce or purchase ethanol, including industrial-grade alcohol, distillers grains, Ultra-High Protein or corn oil that does not meet the specifications defined in our sales contracts, we may be subject to quality claims. We could be required to refund the purchase price of any non-conforming product or replace the non-conforming product at our expense. Ethanol, including industrial-grade alcohol, distillers grains, Ultra-High Protein or corn oil that we purchase or market and subsequently sell to others could result in similar claims if the product does not meet applicable contract specifications, which could have an adverse impact on our profitability.\nBusiness disruptions due to unforeseen operational failures or factors outside of our control could impact our ability to fulfill contractual obligations.\nNatural disasters, pandemics, transportation issues, significant track damage resulting from a train derailment or strikes by our transportation providers could delay shipments of raw materials to our plants or deliveries of ethanol, including industrial-grade alcohol, distillers grains, Ultra-High Protein and corn oil to our customers. If we are unable to meet customer demand or contract delivery requirements due to stalled operations caused by business disruptions, we could potentially lose customers.\nAdverse weather conditions, such as inadequate or excessive amounts of rain during the growing season, overly wet conditions, an early freeze or snowy weather during harvest could impact the supply of corn that is needed to produce ethanol. Corn stored in an open pile may be damaged by rain or warm weather before the corn is dried, shipped or moved into a storage structure.\nOur business continues to be adversely impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak.\nThe outbreak of the coronavirus, or COVID-19, which has been declared by the World Health Organization to be a pandemic, has spread across the globe and continues to impact worldwide economic activity. COVID-19 poses a risk on all aspects of our business, including how it will impact our employees, customers, vendors, and business partners. We are unable to predict the impact that COVID-19 will have on our future financial position and operating results, due to numerous uncertainties. These uncertainties include, but are not limited to: (1) the severity of the virus and its impact on the demand for our products; (2) the duration of the outbreak; (3) federal, state or local governmental regulations or other actions which could include limitations on our operations; (4) the effect on customer demand resulting in a decline in the demand for our products; (5) impacts on our supply chain and potential limitations of supply of our feedstocks; (6) interruptions of our distribution systems and delays in the delivery of our products; (7) the health of our workforce, and our ability to meet staffing needs which is vital to our operations; and (8) volatility in the credit and financial markets.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and related economic repercussions have created significant volatility, uncertainty, and turmoil in the energy industry. We are unable to predict the overall impact these events will have on our future financial position and operations.\nWe continue to actively manage our response in collaboration with customers, government officials, team members and business partners and assessing potential impacts to our future financial position and operating results, as well as adverse developments in our business. It is not possible for us to predict whether there will be additional government-mandated shelter-in-place and similar government orders that could affect our business, how long the existing orders will remain in place, and how these measures will impact our operations.\nOur ethanol-related assets may be at greater risk of terrorist attacks, threats of war or actual war, than other possible targets.\nTerrorist attacks in the United States, including threats of war or actual war, may adversely affect our operations. A direct attack on our ethanol production plants, or our partnership\u2019s storage facilities, fuel terminals and railcars could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, a terrorist attack could\nhave an adverse impact on ethanol prices. Disruption or significant increases in ethanol prices could result in government-imposed price controls.\nOur network infrastructure, enterprise applications and internal technology systems could be damaged or otherwise fail and disrupt business activities.\nOur network infrastructure, enterprise applications and internal technology systems are instrumental to the day-to-day operations of our business. Numerous factors outside of our control, including earthquakes, floods, lightning, tornados, fire, power loss, telecommunication failures, computer viruses, physical or electronic vandalism or similar disruptions could result in system failures, interruptions or loss of critical data and prevent us from fulfilling customer orders. We cannot provide assurance that our backup systems are sufficient to mitigate hardware or software failures, which could result in business disruptions that negatively impact our operating results and damage our reputation.\nWe could be adversely affected by cyber-attacks, data security breaches and significant information technology systems interruptions.\nWe rely on network infrastructure and enterprise applications, and internal technology systems for operational, marketing support and sales, and product development activities. The hardware and software systems related to such activities are subject to damage from earthquakes, floods, lightning, tornados, fire, power loss, telecommunication failures, cyber-attacks and other similar events. They are also subject to acts such as computer viruses, physical or electronic vandalism or other similar disruptions that could cause system interruptions and loss of critical data, and could prevent us from fulfilling customers\u2019 orders. Cybersecurity threats and incidents can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to information technology networks and systems to more sophisticated and targeted measures, known as advanced persistent threats, directed at the company, its products, its customers and/or its third-party service providers. Despite the implementation of cybersecurity measures (including access controls, data encryption, vulnerability assessments, employee training, continuous monitoring, and maintenance of backup and protective systems), the company\u2019s information technology systems may still be vulnerable to cybersecurity threats and other electronic security breaches. While we have taken reasonable efforts to protect ourselves, and to date, we have not experienced any material losses related to cyber-attacks, we cannot assure our shareholders that any of our security measures would be sufficient in the future. Any event that causes failures or interruption in such hardware or software systems could result in disruption of our business operations, have a negative impact on our operating results, and damage our reputation, which could negatively affect our financial condition, results of operation, cash flows.\nWe may not be able to hire and retain qualified personnel to operate our facilities.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain competent employees. Qualified managers, engineers, merchandisers and other personnel must be hired for each of our locations. If we are unable to hire and retain productive, skilled personnel, we may not be able to maximize production, optimize plant operations or execute our business strategy.\nCompliance with and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our performance.\nWe are subject to extensive tax liabilities imposed by multiple jurisdictions, including income taxes, indirect taxes (excise/duty, sales/use, gross receipts, and value-added taxes), payroll taxes, franchise taxes, withholding taxes, and ad valorem taxes. New tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed that could result in increased expenditures for tax liabilities in the future. Many of these liabilities are subject to periodic audits by the respective taxing authority. Subsequent changes to our tax liabilities as a result of these audits may subject us to interest and penalties.\nFederal, state and local jurisdictions may challenge our tax return positions.\nThe positions taken in our federal and state tax return filings require significant judgments, use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is also required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. Despite management\u2019s belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, certain positions may be successfully challenged by federal, state and local jurisdictions.\nFinancial performance of our equity method investments are subject to risks beyond our control and can vary substantially from period to period.\nThe company invests in certain limited liability companies, which are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. This means that the company\u2019s share of net income or loss in the investee increases or decreases, as applicable,\nthe carrying value of the investment. By operating a business through this arrangement, we do not have control over operating decisions as we would if we owned the business outright. Specifically, we cannot act on major business initiatives without the consent of the other investors.\nThe company recognizes these investments as a separate line item in the consolidated balance sheets its proportionate share of earnings on a separate line item in the consolidated statements of operations. As a result, the amount of net investment income recognized from these investments can vary substantially from period to period. Any losses experienced by these entities could adversely impact our results of operations and the value of our investment.\nWe are exposed to credit risk that could result in losses or affect our ability to make payments should a counterparty fail to perform according to the terms of our agreement.\nWe are exposed to credit risk from a variety of customers, including major integrated oil companies, large independent refiners, petroleum wholesalers and other ethanol plants. We are also exposed to credit risk with major suppliers of petroleum products and agricultural inputs when we make payments for undelivered inventories. Our fixed-price forward contracts are subject to credit risk when prices change significantly prior to delivery. The inability by a third party to pay us for our sales, provide product that was paid for in advance or deliver on a fixed-price contract could result in a loss and adversely impact our liquidity and ability to make our own payments when due.\nThe interest rates under our revolving credit facility may be impacted by the phase-out of LIBOR.\nLIBOR is the basic rate of interest widely used as a reference for setting the interest rates on loans globally. We use LIBOR as a reference rate for our revolving credit facilities. In 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. It is unclear if LIBOR will cease to exist at that time or if new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, is considering replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR with a new index, the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d), calculated using short-term repurchase agreements backed by Treasury securities. We are evaluating the potential impact of the eventual replacement of the LIBOR benchmark interest rate, however, we are not able to predict whether LIBOR will cease to be available after 2021, whether SOFR will become a widely accepted benchmark in place of LIBOR, or what the impact of such a possible transition to SOFR may be on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe have limitations, as a holding company, in our ability to receive distributions from a small number of our subsidiaries.\nWe conduct most of our operations through our subsidiaries and rely on dividends or intercompany transfers of funds to generate free cash flow. Some of our subsidiaries are currently, or are expected to be, limited in their ability to pay dividends or make distributions under the terms of their financing agreements. Consequently, we cannot fully rely on the cash flow from one subsidiary to satisfy the loan obligations of another subsidiary. As a result, if a subsidiary is unable to satisfy its loan obligations, we may not be able to prevent default by providing additional cash to that subsidiary, even if sufficient cash exists elsewhere within our organization.\nIncreased federal support of cellulosic ethanol could result in increased competition to corn-based ethanol producers.\nLegislation, including the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and EISA, provides numerous funding opportunities supporting cellulosic ethanol production. In addition, RFS II mandates an increasing level of biofuel production that is not derived from corn, though this will be amended lower by the EPA in the reset rulemaking. Federal policies suggest a long-term political preference for cellulosic processing using feedstocks such as switch grass, silage, wood chips or other forms of biomass. Cellulosic ethanol is viewed more favorably since the feedstock is not diverted from food production and has a smaller carbon footprint. Several cellulosic ethanol plants are currently under development. While these have had limited success to date, as research and development programs persist, there is risk that cellulosic ethanol could displace corn ethanol.\nAny changes in federal mandates from corn-based to cellulosic-based ethanol production may reduce our profitability. Our plants are designed as single-feedstock facilities and would require significant additional investments to convert production to cellulosic ethanol. Furthermore, our plants are strategically located in high-yield, low-cost corn production areas. At present, there is limited supply of alternative feedstocks near our facilities. As a result, the adoption of cellulosic ethanol and its use as the preferred form of ethanol could have a significant adverse impact on our business.\nEnvironmental, social and corporate governance matters and uncertainty regarding regulation of such matters may increase our operating costs, impact our capital markets and potentially reduce the value of our products and assets.\nThe issue of global climate change continues to attract considerable public and scientific attention with widespread concern about the impacts of human activity, especially the emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane. With the incoming administration, climate change legislation in the U.S. is likely to receive increased focus and consideration over the next several years, with numerous proposals having been made and are likely to continue to be made at the international, national, regional and state levels of government that are intended to limit emissions of greenhouse gases and capture carbon. Several states have already adopted measures requiring reduction of greenhouse gases within state boundaries. Other states have elected to participate in voluntary regional cap-and-trade programs. While we believe our products are low carbon and result in a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions compared to alternatives, any significant legislative changes at the international, national, state or local levels could significantly affect our ability to produce and sell our products, could increase the cost of the production and sale of our products and could materially reduce the value of our products.\nApart from governmental regulation, some investment banks based both domestically and internationally have announced that they have adopted environmental, social and corporate governance guidelines (ESG). There have also been efforts in recent years affecting the investment community, including investment advisers, sovereign wealth funds, public pension funds, universities and other groups, promoting the divestment of fossil fuel equities, and encouraging the consideration of ESG practices of companies in a manner that could negatively affect us. The impact of such efforts may adversely affect the demand for and price of securities issued by us, and impact our access to the capital and financial markets.\nFurther, it is believed by some that climate change itself may cause more extreme weather conditions such as more intense hurricanes, thunderstorms, tornadoes and snow or ice storms, as well as rising sea levels and increased volatility in seasonal temperatures. Extreme weather conditions can interfere with our operations and increase our costs, and damage resulting from extreme weather may not be fully insured. However, at this time, we are unable to determine the extent to which any potential climate change may lead to increased weather hazards affecting our operations.\nOur insurance policies do not cover all losses, costs or liabilities that we may experience, and insurance companies that currently insure companies in the energy industry may cease to do so or substantially increase premiums.\nWe are insured under property, liability and business interruption policies, subject to the deductibles and limits under those policies. We have acquired insurance that we believe to be adequate to prevent loss from material foreseeable risks. However, events may occur for which no insurance is available or for which insurance is not available on terms that are acceptable. Loss from an event, such as, but not limited to war, riots, pandemics, terrorism or other risks, may not be insured and such a loss may have a material adverse effect on our operations, cash flows and financial position.\nCertain of our ethanol production plants and our related storage tanks, as well as certain of our fuel terminal facilities are located within recognized seismic and flood zones. We believe that the design of these facilities have been modified to fortify them to meet structural requirements for those regions of the country. We have also obtained additional insurance coverage specific to earthquake and flood risks for the applicable plants and fuel terminals. However, there is no assurance that any such facility would remain in operation if a seismic or flood event were to occur.\nAdditionally, our ability to obtain and maintain adequate insurance may be adversely affected by conditions in the insurance market over which we have no control. In addition, if we experience insurable events, our annual premiums could increase further or insurance may not be available at all. If significant changes in the number or financial solvency of insurance underwriters for the ethanol industry occur, we may be unable to obtain and maintain adequate insurance at a reasonable cost. We cannot assure our unitholders that we will be able to renew our insurance coverage on acceptable terms, if at all, or that we will be able to arrange for adequate alternative coverage in the event of non-renewal. The occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance, the failure by one or more insurers to honor its commitments for an insured event or the loss of insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability of the partnership to make distributions to its unitholders.\nRisks Related to the Partnership\nWe depend on the partnership to provide fuel storage and transportation services.\nThe partnership\u2019s operations are subject to all of the risks and hazards inherent in the storage and transportation of fuel, including: damages to storage facilities, railcars and surrounding properties caused by floods, fires, severe weather,\nexplosions, natural disasters or acts of terrorism; mechanical or structural failures at the partnership\u2019s facilities or at third-party facilities at which its operations are dependent; curtailments of operations relative to severe weather; and other hazards, resulting in severe damage or destruction of the partnership\u2019s assets or temporary or permanent shut-down of the partnership\u2019s facilities. If the partnership is unable to serve our storage and transportation needs, our ability to operate our business could be adversely impacted, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. The inability of the partnership to continue operations, for any reason, could also impact the value of our investment in the partnership and, because the partnership is a consolidated entity, our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe partnership\u2019s revolving credit facility includes restrictions that may limit its ability to finance future operations, meet its capital needs or expand its business. In addition, the partnership\u2019s revolving credit facility matures on December 31, 2021 and the partnership may not be able to renew, extend or replace the expiring facility with similar terms. If the partnership fails to comply with covenants in its revolving credit facility or if the facility is terminated, the partnership may be required to repay its indebtedness thereunder, which may have an adverse effect on the partnership\u2019s liquidity and its ability to operate and provide services to us.\nThe partnership is dependent upon the earnings and cash flow generated by its operations in order to meet its debt service obligations and to allow the partnership to pay cash distributions to our unitholders. The operating and financial restrictions and covenants in the partnership\u2019s revolving credit facility or in any future financing agreements could restrict its ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to expand or pursue its business activities, which may, in turn, limit its ability to pay cash distributions to unitholders. For example, the partnership\u2019s revolving credit facility restricts its ability to, among other things: (1) make certain cash distributions; (2) incur certain indebtedness; (3) create certain liens; (4) make certain investments; (5) merge or sell certain of our assets; and (6) expand the nature of our business.\nFurthermore, the partnership\u2019s revolving credit facility contains covenants requiring it to maintain certain financial ratios.\nThe provisions of the partnership\u2019s revolving credit facility may affect its ability to obtain future financing and pursue attractive business opportunities and its flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in business conditions. In addition, a failure to comply with the provisions of the partnership\u2019s revolving credit facility could result in an event of default that could enable the partnership\u2019s lenders, subject to the terms and conditions of the partnership\u2019s revolving credit facility, to declare the outstanding principal of that debt, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable and/or to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure such debt. If there is a default or event of default, the payment of the partnership\u2019s debt is accelerated, defaults under its other debt instruments, if any, may be triggered, and its assets may be insufficient to repay such debt in full. Therefore, the holders of our units could experience a partial or total loss of their investment.\nThe credit facility will mature on December 31, 2021. The partnership anticipates that it will renew and extend the credit facility prior to its maturity. Adverse changes in market conditions could make the renewal of the credit facility more difficult or cold result in an increase in the cost to renew.\nThe partnership may not have sufficient available cash to pay quarterly distributions on its units.\nThe amount of cash the partnership can distribute depends on how much cash is generated from operations, which can fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on ethanol and other fuel volumes, handling fees, payments associated with minimum volume commitments, timely payments by subsidiaries, and other third parties, and prevailing economic conditions. The amount of cash available for distribution also depends on the partnership\u2019s operating and general and administrative expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions and organic growth projects, debt service requirements, working capital needs, ability to borrow funds and access capital markets, revolving credit facility restrictions, cash reserves and other risks affecting cash levels. Increasing the partnership\u2019s borrowings or other debt to finance certain projects could increase interest expense, which could impact the amount of cash available for distributions.\nThere are no limitations in the partnership agreement regarding its ability to issue additional units. Should the partnership issue additional units in connection with an acquisition or expansion, the distributions on the incremental units will increase the risk that the partnership will be unable to maintain or increase distributions on a per unit basis.\nIncreases in interest rates could adversely impact the partnership\u2019s unit price, ability to issue equity or incur debt, and pay cash distributions at intended levels.\nThe partnership\u2019s cash distributions and implied distribution yield affect its unit price. Distributions are often used by investors to compare and rank yield-oriented securities when making investment decisions. A rising interest rate environment\ncould have an adverse impact on the partnership\u2019s unit price, ability to issue equity or incur debt or pay cash distributions at intended levels, which could adversely impact the value of our investment in the partnership.\nWe may be required to pay taxes on our share of the partnership\u2019s income that are greater than the cash distributions we receive from the partnership.\nThe unitholders of the partnership generally include, for purposes of calculating their U.S. federal, state and local income taxes, their share of the partnership\u2019s taxable income, whether they have received cash distributions from the partnership. We ultimately may not receive cash distributions from the partnership equal to our share of taxable income or the taxes that are due with respect to that income, which could negatively impact our liquidity.\nA majority of the executive officers and directors of the partnership are also officers of our company, which could result in conflicts of interest.\nWe indirectly own and control the partnership and appoint all of its officers and directors. A majority of the executive officers and directors of the partnership are also officers or directors of our company. Although our directors and officers have a fiduciary responsibility to manage the company in a manner that is beneficial to us, as directors and officers of the partnership, they also have certain duties to the partnership and its unitholders. Conflicts of interest may arise between us and our affiliates, and the partnership and its unitholders, and in resolving these conflicts, the partnership may favor its own interests over the company\u2019s interests. In certain circumstances, the partnership may refer conflicts of interest or potential conflicts of interest to its conflicts committee, which must consist entirely of independent directors, for resolution. The conflicts committee must act in the best interests of the public unitholders of the partnership. As a result, the partnership may manage its business in a manner that differs from the best interests of the company or our stockholders, which could adversely affect our profitability.\nCash available for distributions could be reduced and likely cause a substantial reduction in unit value if the partnership became subject to entity-level taxation for federal income tax purposes.\nThe present federal income tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships or investments in its units could be modified, at any time, by administrative, legislative or judicial changes and interpretations. From time to time, members of Congress propose and consider substantive changes to the existing federal income tax laws that affect publicly traded partnerships. Should any legislative proposal eliminate the qualifying income exception, all publicly traded partnerships would be treated as corporations for federal income tax purposes. The partnership would be required to pay federal income tax on its taxable income at the corporate tax rate and likely state and local income taxes at varying rates as well. Distributions to unitholders would be taxed as corporate distributions. The partnership\u2019s cash available for distributions and the value of the units would be substantially reduced.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock may be highly volatile and subject to factors beyond our control.\nSome of the many factors that can influence the price of our common stock include: (1) our results of operations and the performance of our competitors; (2) public\u2019s reaction to our press releases, public announcements and filings with the SEC;\n(3) changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by equity research analysts who follow us or other companies in our industry; (4) changes in general economic conditions; (5) changes in market prices for our products or raw materials and related substitutes; (6) sales of common stock by our directors, executive officers and significant shareholders; (7) actions by institutional investors trading in our stock; (8) disruptions in our operations; (9) changes in our management team; (10) other developments affecting us, our industry or our competitors; and (11) U.S. and international economic, legal and regulatory factors unrelated to our performance.\nIn recent years the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations, which are unrelated to the operating performance of any particular company. These broad market fluctuations could materially reduce the price of our common stock price based on factors that have little or nothing to do with our company or its performance.\nAnti-takeover provisions could make it difficult for a third party to acquire us.\nOur restated articles of incorporation, restated bylaws and Iowa\u2019s law contain anti-takeover provisions that could delay or prevent change in control of us or our management. These provisions discourage proxy contests, making it difficult for our shareholders to elect directors or take other corporate actions without the consent of our board of directors, which include: (1) board members have three-year staggered terms; (2) board members can only be removed for cause with an affirmative vote of no less than two-thirds of the outstanding shares; (3) shareholder action can only be taken at a special or annual meeting,\nnot by written consent except where required by Iowa law; (4) shareholders are restricted from making proposals at shareholder meetings; and (5) the board of directors can issue authorized or unissued shares of stock.\nWe are subject to the provisions of the Iowa Business Corporations Act, which prohibits combinations between an Iowa corporation whose stock is publicly traded or held by more than 2,000 shareholders and an interested shareholder for three years unless certain exemption requirements are met.\nProvisions in the convertible notes could also make it more difficult or too expensive for a third party to acquire us. If a takeover constitutes a fundamental change, holders of the notes have the right to require us to repurchase their notes in cash. If a takeover constitutes a make-whole fundamental change, we may be required to increase the conversion rate for holders who convert their notes. In either case, the obligation under the notes could increase the acquisition cost and discourage a third party from acquiring us.\nThese items discourage transactions that could otherwise command a premium over prevailing market prices and may limit the price investors are willing to pay for our stock.\nNon-U.S. shareholders may be subject to U.S. income tax on gains related to the sale of their common stock.\nIf we are a U.S. real property holding corporation during the shorter of the five-year period before the stock was sold or the period the stock was held by a non-U.S. shareholder, the non-U.S. shareholder could be subject to U.S federal income tax on gains related to the sale of their common stock. Whether we are a U.S. real property holding corporation depends on the fair market value of our U.S. real property interests relative to our other trade or business assets and non-U.S. real property interests. We cannot provide assurance that we are not a U.S. real property holding corporation or will not become one in the future.", "PERMNO": 91161, "SIC": 2860, "TIC": "GPRE"}
