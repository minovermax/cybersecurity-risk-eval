{"cik": "1275014", "company": "Ultra Clean Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-11", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nThe following risk factors could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations and cause reputational harm, and should be carefully considered in evaluating the Company and its business, in addition to other information presented elsewhere in this report.\nCOVID-19 outbreak\nThe novel coronavirus COVID-19 is impacting all levels of the semiconductor industry and supply chain. For example:\n\u2022\nA decrease in the production (and consumption) of electronics, such as smart phones, computers, servers and televisions, much of which is concentrated in Asia (specifically China), may result in lower chip demand.\n\u2022\nA reduced output from the semiconductor fabrication plants located in China and South Korea (and other regions experiencing a significant level of COVID-19 infections) may delay additional equipment move-in\u2019s and supporting new orders at those fabrication plants.\n\u2022\nOur operations, as well as the operations of our OEM customers, at the equipment manufacturing sites located in these regions may be reduced or shut down.\n\u2022\nOur suppliers located in these regions may experience a reduction in output and difficulty finding a reliable delivery method for their products, which may result in a delay in delivering those products to us.\n\u2022\nA decrease in the rate of parts cleaning cycles at the fabrication facilities located in these regions may reduce our SSB services in those regions.\nWe are attempting to lessen the impact of COVID-19 to UCT equipment production by leveraging our extensive global supply chain and diversified factory footprint and, therefore, minimize the potential disruption to our customers. Our business continuity plan team has taken every precaution to protect our employees and factories with a wide array of preventive measures, including, among others, making protective gears and temperature sensing equipment available, implementing travel restriction and work from home policies, an increase in hygienic and janitorial services, and enforcing preventative quarantines.\nThe cyclical and highly volatile nature of the industries we serve could harm our operating results.\nOur business and operating results depend in significant part upon capital expenditures by manufacturers in the semiconductor and display industries, which in turn depend upon the current and anticipated market demand for such products. Historically, the industries we serve (in particular the semiconductor industry) have been highly cyclical, with recurring periods of over-supply of products that have had a severe negative effect on the demand for capital equipment and related services involved in manufacturing such products. We have experienced and anticipate that we will continue to experience significant fluctuations in customer orders for our products through such cycles. Although certain aspects of our business, including the cleaning, coating and analytical services delivered by QGT which also supports the semiconductor chip market are less susceptible to variations in capital expenditures by manufacturers than other aspects of our business, slowdowns in the industries we serve have had, and future slowdowns may also have, a material adverse effect on our operating results. Demand shifts in the industries we serve are rapid and difficult to predict, and we may not be able to anticipate or respond quickly enough to changes in demand. Our ability to increase revenues of our products and services in periods of increasing demand depends, in part, upon our ability to:\n\u2022\nmobilize our supply chain in order to maintain component and raw material supply;\n\u2022\noptimize the use of our design, engineering and manufacturing capacity in a timely manner;\n\u2022\ndeliver our products and services to our customers in a timely fashion;\n\u2022\nexpand, if necessary, our manufacturing, cleaning, coating and analytical services capacity; and\n\u2022\nmaintain our product and service quality as we increase production.\nIf we are unable to respond to rapid increases in demand for our products and services on a timely basis, or to manage any corresponding expansion of our manufacturing and service capacity effectively, our customers could divert their purchases of products and services from us to our competitors, which would adversely affect our business.\nOur ability to remain profitable and mitigate the impact on our business in periods of decreasing demand depends, in part, upon our ability to:\n\u2022\noptimize our inventory levels and reduce or cancel orders from our suppliers without compromising our relationships with such suppliers;\n\u2022\nreduce our fixed and variable costs through a number of initiatives, which may include reducing our manufacturing workforce;\n\u2022\ncontinue to motivate our employees; and\n\u2022\nmaintain the prices, quality and delivery cycles of our products and services in order to retain our customers\u2019 business.\nThe limited visibility we have from the majority of our customers of their future orders, combined with the cyclical and volatile nature of the industries we serve, make future revenues, results of operations and net cash flows difficult to estimate.\nWe rely on a small number of original equipment manufacturing (\u201cOEM\u201d) and integrated device manufacturing (\u201cIDM\u201d) customers for a significant portion of our revenues, and any adverse change in our relationships with these customers, including a decision by such customers not to continue to outsource critical subsystems or part cleaning, coating or analytical services to us or to give market share to one of our competitors, would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our customers also exert a significant amount of negotiating leverage over us, which may require us to accept lower operating margins, increased liability risks or changes in our operations in order to retain or expand our market share with them.\nA relatively small number of OEM customers have historically accounted for a significant portion of our revenues, and we expect this trend to continue. Our top two customers accounted for 66.9%, 76.6% and 84.4% of our revenues for fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and we expect that our revenues will continue to be concentrated among a small number of customers. In addition, our customer contracts generally do not require customers to place any orders. Accordingly, the success of our products business depends on OEMs continuing to outsource the manufacturing of critical subsystems to us. Because of the small number of OEMs in the markets we serve, most of which are already our customers, it would be difficult to replace lost revenue resulting from the loss of, or the reduction, cancellation or delay in purchase orders by, any one of these customers, whether due to such customer\u2019s decision to not continue to outsource all or a portion of its critical subsystems for its capital equipment to us, such customer giving market share to our competitors or for other reasons, such as a customer\u2019s bankruptcy or insolvency or decreased demand for such customer\u2019s products. We have in the past lost business from customers who have taken the manufacturing of our products in-house, given market share to our competitors or declared bankruptcy. Further, since our customers generally own the designs and other intellectual property to the products we manufacture, we cannot prevent them from licensing such designs and other intellectual property to our competitors for the manufacturing of such products. If we are unable to replace revenue from customers who determine to take subsystem assembly in-house, give market share to our competitors or from whom we otherwise lose business, such events could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations.\nOur Semiconductor Services Business provides part cleaning, coating and analytical expertise, to IDM and OEM customers. Our IDM business is concentrated in a relatively small number of customers, and we compete with in-house capabilities, OEM\u2019s who perform cleaning as part of service contracts, and businesses that provide cleaning, coating and analytical services. The OEM customer profile of our SSB segment has significant overlap with our products business and is subject to risks of market share loss to cleaning, coating and analytical services competitors. The cleaning and analytical process are proprietary to QuantumClean\u00ae and ChemTrace\u00ae, respectively, and transition to new suppliers may require requalification on the part of the customer.\nConsolidation among our customers, or a decision by any one or more of our customers to outsource all or most manufacturing, assembly, cleaning, coating and analytical services work to a single equipment manufacturer, may further concentrate our business in a limited number of customers and expose us to increased risks relating to dependence on an even smaller number of customers.\nIn addition, due to the size and revenue contribution levels from our largest customers, they are able to exert significant pricing pressure in the negotiation of our commercial agreements and individual purchase orders. Our customers often require reduced prices or other quality, manufacturing or delivery commitments as a condition to their awarding the placement of orders with us in any given period. This may, among other things, result in reduced operating margins or require capital or other expenditures in order to maintain or expand our market share. Our customers\u2019 negotiating leverage also can result in terms and conditions that may contain significant liability risk to us. For example, our customers generally require that we provide them indemnification against certain liabilities, which may include claims of losses by their own customers resulting out of property damages, bodily injuries or deaths, or infringement of intellectual property rights by our products. Our potential liability arising out of intellectual property infringement claims by any third party is generally uncapped. In some cases, we have self-insured against liability risk meaning that we may be directly responsible for a high magnitude of liability claims by our customers without recourse to insurance proceeds from third-party insurers. Our customers may also pressure us to make other concessions in order to preserve or expand our market share with them. Those concessions may harm our business. For example, customers may require us to move the manufacturing of our products from lower-cost geographies such as China to higher-cost geographies such as Singapore. Such transfer of manufacturing could result in reduced margins and a sub-optimal cost structure. Similarly, customers may prevent us from moving our manufacturing from higher-cost regions to lower-cost regions, while requiring us to reduce our prices. If we are unable to retain and expand our business with our customers on favorable terms, our business and operating results will be adversely affected and we may be susceptible to increased liability risk. This additional liability risk could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur dependence on our suppliers may prevent us from delivering an acceptable product on a timely basis.\nWe rely on both single-source and sole-source suppliers, some of whom are relatively small, for many of the components we use in our products and services. In addition, our customers often specify components or raw materials of particular suppliers that we must incorporate into our products. Our suppliers may be under no long-term obligation to provide us with components or raw materials. As a result, the loss of or failure to perform by any of these suppliers could adversely affect our business and operating results. In addition, the manufacturing of certain components and subsystems and the cleaning, coating and analysis of tool parts are complex processes. Therefore, if a supplier were unable to provide the volume of supplies, components or raw materials we require on a timely basis and at acceptable prices and quality, we would have to identify and qualify replacements from alternative sources. However, the process of qualifying new suppliers for complex components and raw materials is lengthy and could delay our production or delivery of services, which would adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe may also experience difficulty in obtaining sufficient supplies of components and raw materials in times of growth in our business. For example, we have in the past experienced shortages in supplies of various components, such as mass flow controllers, valves and regulators, and certain prefabricated parts, such as sheet metal enclosures, used in the manufacture of our products. In addition, one of our competitors manufactures mass flow controllers that may be specified by one or more of our customers. If we are unable to obtain these particular mass flow controllers from our competitor or convince a customer to select alternative mass flow controllers, we may be unable to meet that customer\u2019s requirements, which could result in a loss of market share.\nIf we, or our suppliers, are unable to procure sufficient quantities of supplies, components or raw materials from suppliers, it could influence decisions by our customers to delay or cancel orders or service contracts and decisions by our vendors to fulfill our purchase orders and, consequently, have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur inability to successfully manage the implementation of a company-wide enterprise resource planning (\u201cERP\u201d) system could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe are in the process of implementing a new company-wide ERP system. This process has been and continues to be complex and time-consuming and we expect to incur additional capital outlays and expenses. This ERP system will replace many of our existing operating and financial systems, which is a major undertaking from a financial management and personnel perspective. Should the new ERP system not be implemented successfully throughout all our business units on time and within budget, or if the system does not perform in a satisfactory manner, it could be disruptive and adversely affect our operations, including our potential ability to report accurate, timely and consistent financial results; our ability to purchase supplies, components and raw materials from and pay our suppliers; and our ability to deliver products and services to customers on a timely basis and to collect our receivables from them.\nIn addition, we have teams leading the implementation of the ERP system at most of our locations. To the extent that these teams or key individuals are not retained through the implementation period, the success of our implementation could be compromised and the expected benefits of the ERP system may not be realized. If the new ERP system is not successfully and fully implemented, it could negatively affect our financial reporting, inventory management and our future sales, profitability and financial condition.\nWe are subject to order and shipment uncertainties and any significant reductions, cancellations or delays in customer orders could cause our revenue to decline and our operating results to suffer.\nOur revenue is difficult to forecast because we generally do not have a material backlog of unfilled orders and because of the short time frame within which we are often required to design, produce or deliver products to our customers. Most of our revenue in any quarter depends on customer orders for our products that we receive and fulfill in the same quarter. We generally do not have long-term purchase orders or contracts that contain minimum purchase commitments from our customers. Instead, we receive non-binding forecasts of the future volume of orders from our customers. Occasionally, we order and build component inventory in advance of the receipt of actual customer orders. Customers may cancel order forecasts, change production quantities from forecasted volumes or delay production for reasons beyond our control. Furthermore, reductions, cancellations or delays in customer order forecasts, which may occur for various reasons, including reduced demand for our customer\u2019s products, customer bankruptcies or customer insolvency, usually occur without penalty to, or compensation from, the customer. Reductions, cancellations or delays in forecasted orders could cause us to hold inventory longer than anticipated, which could reduce our gross profit, restrict our ability to fund our operations and cause us to incur unanticipated reductions or delays in revenue. Moreover, many of the products we manufacture are custom built for our customers and are therefore not fungible with products we sell to other customers. If we do not obtain orders as we anticipate, we could have excess component inventory for a specific product that we would not be able to sell to another customer, likely resulting in inventory write-offs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, because many of our costs are fixed in the short term, we could experience deterioration in our gross profit and operating margins when our sales volumes decline.\nThe manufacturing of our products and the services we provide are highly complex, and if we are not able to manage our manufacturing and procurement process effectively, our business and operating results will suffer.\nThe manufacturing of our products is a highly complex process. The services we provide are also highly complex, and dependent upon procuring specialty materials necessary to correctly perform the complex/precise services. Both the manufacturing of our products and the services we provide involve the integration of multiple components and require effective management of our supply chain while meeting our customers\u2019 design-to-delivery cycle time requirements. Through the course of the manufacturing process, our customers may modify design and system configurations in response to changes in their own customers\u2019 requirements. In order to rapidly respond to these modifications and deliver our products to our customers in a timely manner, we must effectively manage our manufacturing and procurement process. If we fail to manage this process effectively, we risk losing customers and damaging our reputation. We may also be subject to liability under our agreements with our customers if we or our suppliers fail to effectively or timely re-configure manufacturing processes or components in response to these modifications or if shipments of our products are delayed, which may lead to product defect or other claims by our customers or cancelled orders. In addition, if we acquire inventory in excess of demand or that does not meet customer specifications, we could incur excess or obsolete inventory charges. These risks are even greater during periods of macroeconomic uncertainty or down cycles in our industry, and as we continue to expand our business beyond gas delivery systems into new subsystems or services with which we have less experience. During periods of economic uncertainty or down cycles in our industry, certain of our suppliers may be forced to reduce or go out of business, which could require us to either procure products from higher-cost suppliers or, if no additional suppliers exist, reconfigure the design and manufacture of our products. This could limit our growth and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe held our customers\u2019 inventories on our premises and any significant damage or loss to these inventories could cause our operating results to suffer.\nIn connection with our cleaning business, we face a number of risks associated with customer inventory being held on our property, including the risk of loss or mishandling of, or other damage to, customer inventory, any of which could harm our reputation, adversely affect our business, and otherwise expose us to increased liabilities or losses.\nOur results of operations, financial position and cash flows may suffer if we do not effectively manage our inventory.\nInventory is one of the largest assets on our balance sheet, representing 16.9% of our total assets as of December 27, 2019. We must manage our inventory of raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods effectively to meet changing customer requirements, while keeping inventory costs down and maintaining or improving gross margins.\nHistorically, the industries we serve (in particular the semiconductor capital equipment industry) have been highly cyclical, which makes accurately forecasting customers\u2019 product needs difficult. Although we seek to maintain sufficient inventory levels of materials to guard against interruptions in supply and to meet our customers\u2019 needs, we may experience shortages of certain key materials, particularly in times of high industry demand. We also face long lead times from our suppliers, which may be longer than the lead times provided to us by our customers. If we underestimate customer demand or if insufficient manufacturing capacity or raw materials are available, we may have to forego sales opportunities, lose market share and damage our customer relationships.\nIn the event we overestimate customer demand, we may allocate resources to manufacturing products that we may not be able to sell. As a result, we could hold excess or obsolete inventory, which would reduce our profit margins and adversely affect our financial results. Some of our products have in the past and may in the future become obsolete while in inventory due to changing customer specifications, or become excess inventory due to decreased demand for our products and an inability to sell the inventory within a foreseeable period. Furthermore, our customers may be able to cancel orders on short notice. This could result in charges that reduce our gross profit and gross margin. Furthermore, if market prices drop below the prices at which we value inventory, we would need to take a charge for a reduction in inventory values in accordance with the applicable accounting rules. Any future unexpected changes in demand or increases in costs of production that cause us to take additional charges for un-saleable, obsolete or excess inventory, or to reduce inventory values, would adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe hold inventory at our various manufacturing sites globally and many of these sites have more than one inventory warehouse. Successfully managing our inventory is dependent upon our information technology systems and internal controls. We rely upon such information technology systems and internal controls to accurately and timely manage, store and replenish inventory, complete and track customer orders, coordinate sales activities across all of our products and maintain and report vital data and information. A disruption in our information technology systems or a failure of our internal controls could result in delays or disruptions in receiving inventory and supplies or filling customer orders, incorrect inventory counts, over or under stocking or loss of inventory and adversely affect our business, customer relationships and results of operations. In particular, our largest customer requires that certain of our products are manufactured and shipped out of our Singapore facility. High levels of customer demand at such facility in fiscal year 2017 created substantial strain on our processes, internal controls and information technology systems. There can be no assurance that such delays, failures or disruptions will not have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur customers require our products to undergo a lengthy and expensive qualification process. If we are unsuccessful or delayed in qualifying any of our products with a customer, our results of operations and financial condition could suffer.\nWe have had to qualify, and are required to maintain our status, as a supplier for each of our customers. This is often a lengthy process that involves the inspection and approval by a customer of our engineering, documentation, manufacturing and quality control procedures before that customer will place volume orders. Our ability to lessen the adverse effect of any loss of, or reduction in sales to, an existing customer through the rapid addition of one or more new customers is limited because of these qualification requirements. Consequently, the risk that our business, operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected by the loss of, or any reduction in orders by, any of our significant customers is increased. Moreover, if we lose our existing status as a qualified supplier to any of our customers, such customer could cancel its orders from us or otherwise terminate its relationship with us, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nAcquisitions could result in operating and integration difficulties, dilution, margin deterioration, diversion of management\u2019s attention, and other consequences that may adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nWe have made, and may in the future make, acquisitions of, or significant investments in, businesses that offer complementary products, services, technologies or market access. We expect that management will evaluate potential strategic transactions regularly with its advisors and our board of directors in the ordinary course of business. We may not be successful in negotiating the terms of potential acquisitions or financing potential acquisitions, and our due diligence may fail to identify all of the problems, liabilities or other challenges associated with an acquired business, product or technology, including issues related to intellectual property, product quality or product architecture, regulatory compliance practices, revenue recognition or other accounting practices or employee or customer retention issues. In addition, we may not be successful in effectively integrating the acquired business, product or technology into our existing business and operations. The areas where we face risks include:\n\u2022\nmanagement of a larger, more complex and capital intensive, combined business, including integrating supply and distribution channels, computer and accounting systems, and other aspects of operations;\n\u2022\nexposure to new operational risks, rules, regulations, worker expectations, customs and practices to the extent acquired businesses are located in regions where UCT has not historically conducted business;\n\u2022\ninability to complete proposed transactions due to the failure to obtain regulatory or other approvals, litigation or other disputes, and any ensuing obligation to pay a termination fee;\n\u2022\ndeterioration of gross margins due to the acquired company having the same customer base as us, resulting in reduced pricing leverage;\n\u2022\nthe failure to realize expected returns from acquired businesses;\n\u2022\nreductions in cash balances or increases in debt obligations to finance the acquisition, which reduce the availability of cash flow for general corporate or other purposes;\n\u2022\nintegration of the capabilities of the acquired businesses while maintaining focus on providing consistently high quality products;\n\u2022\nincorporation of different financial and reporting controls, processes, systems and technologies into our existing business environment;\no\nBased on our evaluation under the COSO framework as further described under \u201cItem 9A - Controls and Procedures,\u201d our management concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 27, 2019 due to material weaknesses attributable to deficiencies in the design and implementation of business process controls and information technology general controls relating to all relevant accounts and cycles within our Semiconductor Services Business (SSB) segment.\n\u2022\nunforeseen liabilities, expenses, or other losses associated with the acquisitions for which we do not have recourse under their respective agreements;\n\u2022\nthe risk of litigation or claims associated with a proposed or completed transaction;\n\u2022\ninadequacy or ineffectiveness of an acquired company\u2019s internal financial controls, disclosure controls and procedures, or environmental, health and safety, anti-corruption, human resource or other policies or practices;\n\u2022\nperformance shortfalls as a result of the diversion of management\u2019s attention from the Company\u2019s operations;\n\u2022\ncultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired business into our organization, and incentivization and retention of employees from the businesses we acquire; and\n\u2022\ndifficulties associated with the retention and transition of new customers and partners into our existing business.\nOur failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or investments, incur unanticipated liabilities and substantial costs, and materially harm our business generally.\nOur acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, or amortization expenses, impairment charges and restructuring charges, any of which could harm our financial condition. Also, the anticipated benefits or value of our acquisitions or investments may not materialize. Even if an acquisition or other investment is not completed, we may divert significant management time and effort and incur significant financial cost in evaluating such acquisition or investment, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Furthermore, due to prevailing conditions in the credit market and our existing leverage, the financing of any such acquisition may be difficult to obtain if at all, and the terms of any such financing may not be favorable.\nFailure to realize the benefits expected from the QGT and DMS acquisitions could adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nAlthough we expect significant benefits to result from the QGT and DMS acquisitions, there can be no assurance that we will actually realize them. Achieving these benefits will depend, in part, on our ability to integrate QGT's and DMS\u2019 businesses successfully and efficiently. The challenges involved in these integrations, which will be complex and time consuming, include the following: preserving customer and other important relationships of QGT and DMS; managing effectively a new business and competing in a new industry for QGT; consolidating and integrating information technology, finance, general and administrative infrastructures; coordinating sales and marketing efforts to effectively position our capabilities; coordinating and integrating operations in countries in which we have not previously operated; and integrating employees and related HR systems and benefits, maintaining employee morale and retaining key employees. The successful integration of the QGT and DMS businesses will require significant management attention, and may divert the attention of management from our business and operational issues.\nBased on our evaluation under the COSO framework as further described under \u201cItem 9A - Controls and Procedures,\u201d our management concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 27, 2019 due to material weaknesses attributable to deficiencies in the design and implementation of business process controls and information technology general controls relating to all relevant accounts and cycles within our Semiconductor Services Business (SSB) segment.\nIf we do not successfully manage these issues and the other challenges inherent in integrating an acquired business, we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the QGT and DMS acquisitions and our revenue, expenses, operating results, financial condition and stock price could be materially adversely affected.\nWe are exposed to risks associated with volatility in the global economy.\nWe rely to a significant extent on OEM customers, whose business, in turn, depends largely on consumer spending and capital expenditures by businesses. Uncertainty regarding the global economy may pose challenges to our business. Economic uncertainty may exacerbate negative trends in business and consumer spending and may cause certain of our customers to push out, cancel, or refrain from placing orders for products or services, which may reduce sales and materially affect our results of operations and financial condition. Inflationary trends could also have an impact on labor costs and component costs, reducing our margins. Difficulties in obtaining capital, uncertain market conditions, or reduced profitability may also cause some customers to scale back operations, exit businesses, merge with other manufacturers, or file for bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations, leading to customers\u2019 reduced research and development funding and/or capital expenditures and, in turn, lower orders from our customers and/or additional slow moving or obsolete inventory or bad debt expense for us. These conditions may also similarly affect key suppliers, which could impair their ability to deliver supplies, components or raw materials and result in delays for our products or services or require us to either procure supplies, components or raw materials from higher-cost suppliers, or if no additional suppliers exist, to reconfigure the design and manufacture of our products or services, and we may be unable to fulfill customer orders.\nEscalating trade tensions and the adoption or expansion of tariffs and trade restrictions could negatively impact us.\nInternational trade tensions or trade wars, as well as other changes in social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or laws and policies, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. The U.S. Government has recently announced tariffs on steel and aluminum products and materials imported into the United States. The U.S. Government has also implemented or announced plans to impose tariffs on a wide-range of goods imported from China, where we and our customers have significant operations. Additionally, various countries and economic regions have announced plans or intentions to impose retaliatory tariffs on a wide-range of products they import from the U.S., and there is a risk that a broader trade conflict could ensue. These newly imposed or threatened U.S. tariffs and retaliatory tariffs could have the negative effect of increasing the cost of materials for our products, which could result in our products becoming less competitive or generating lower margins. This has the potential to impact global trade and economic conditions in many of the regions where we do business.\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s (UK) pending withdrawal from the European Union (EU), commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit,\u201d has created significant uncertainty concerning the future relationship between the UK and the EU and the impact on global markets. It is unclear what financial, trade, regulatory and legal implications the withdrawal of the UK from the EU will have and how such withdrawal will affect us. Furthermore, the announcement of Brexit caused significant volatility in global stock markets and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, and the pending withdrawal of the UK from the EU may also adversely affect European and global economic and market conditions, which may cause our customers to closely monitor their costs and reduce their spending budgets. Any of these effects of Brexit, among others, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOther changes in U.S. or international social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or laws and policies governing tax laws, foreign trade, manufacturing, and development and investment in the countries where we or our customers operate could also adversely affect our operating results and our business.\nWe have significant existing indebtedness; the restrictive covenants under our credit agreement or other limitations on financing may limit our ability to expand or pursue our business strategy or make capital expenditures; if we are forced to pay some or all of our indebtedness prior to its maturity, our financial position could be severely and adversely affected.\nWe have total debt as of December 27, 2019 of 292.2 million. Such debt is composed of a $300.0 million term loan outstanding under our Credit Agreement with Barclays Bank less debt costs of $9.7 million and $1.9 million under FDS\u2019s revolving credit facility in the Czech Republic.\nOur indebtedness could have adverse consequences including:\n\u2022\nrisk associated with any inability to satisfy debt obligations;\n\u2022\nthe portion of our cash flows that must be dedicated to interest and principal payments and will not be available for operations, working capital, capital expenditures, expansion, acquisitions or general corporate or other purposes; and\n\u2022\nimpairing our ability to obtain additional financing in the future, if needed.\nIf we are unable to meet our debt obligations as they come due, we could be forced to restructure or refinance such obligations, seek additional equity financing or sell assets, which we may not be able to do on satisfactory terms, or at all. If we determine it is necessary to seek additional funding for any reason, we may not be able to obtain such funding or, if funding is available, may not be able to obtain it on acceptable terms.\nOur Credit Agreement contains certain covenants that restrict our ability to take certain actions, including our ability to incur additional debt, including guarantees, create liens, make certain investments, engage in transactions with affiliates and engage in certain mergers and acquisitions.\nOur Credit Agreement requires us to maintain certain financial covenants, including compliance with a maximum consolidated total gross leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. Our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our indebtedness, which would materially adversely affect our financial health if we are unable to access sufficient funds to repay all of the outstanding amounts.\nAs long as our indebtedness remains outstanding, the restrictive covenants and mandatory prepayment provisions could impair our ability to expand or pursue our business strategies or obtain additional funding.\nWe may not be able to fund our future capital requirements or strategic acquisitions from our operations, and financing from other sources may not be available on favorable terms or at all.\nWe made capital expenditures of approximately $25.7 million and $29.2 million for fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively, which primarily related to our ERP system implementation and to investment in our manufacturing facilities in the United States, China, Singapore and South Korea. The amount of our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe cost required to ensure appropriate IT systems;\n\u2022\nthe cost required to ensure access to adequate manufacturing capacity;\n\u2022\nthe timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts;\n\u2022\nthe timing of introductions of new products and enhancements to existing products;\n\u2022\nthe timing, size and availability of strategic transactions we may enter into;\n\u2022\nthe cost required to integrate our acquisitions into our business, including into our ERP system;\n\u2022\nchanging manufacturing capabilities to meet new or increased customer requirements;\n\u2022\nmarket acceptance of our products; and\n\u2022\nan ability to generate sufficient cash flow from our operating activities.\nWe regularly consider opportunities for strategic acquisitions. On April 15, 2019, we acquired substantially all of the assets of DMS for approximately $29.9 million in cash, subject to certain post-closing adjustments, and we may pay up to $12.5 million in additional cash earn-out if the combined weldment business after the acquisition achieves certain gross profit and gross margin targets for the twelve months ending June 26, 2020. We drew $15.0 million from our available Revolving Credit Facility to finance this acquisition.\nIn order to finance our capital expenditures or any future strategic acquisitions, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing, but such financing may not be available on terms satisfactory to us, or at all. Access to capital markets has, in the past, been unavailable to companies such as ours. In addition, equity financings could be dilutive to holders of our common stock, and debt financings would likely involve additional covenants that restrict our business operations. Any potential strategic acquisition or significant capital expenditure may also require the consent of our existing lenders. If we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms if and when needed, we may not be able to develop or enhance our products, take advantage of future opportunities, including potential acquisitions, grow our business or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements, any of which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur quarterly revenue and operating results could fluctuate significantly from period to period, and this may cause volatility in our common stock price.\nOur quarterly revenue and operating results, including our gross margin, have fluctuated significantly in the past, and we expect them to continue to fluctuate in the future for a variety of reasons which may include:\n\u2022\ndemand for and market acceptance of our products and services as a result of the cyclical nature of the industries we serve or otherwise, often resulting in reduced sales during industry downturns and increased sales during periods of industry recovery or growth;\n\u2022\noverall economic conditions;\n\u2022\nchanges in the timing and size of orders by our customers;\n\u2022\nloss of business from one or more significant customers due to strategic decisions by our customers to terminate their outsourcing relationship with us or give market share to our competitors, or due to decreased demand for our customers\u2019 products by end customers;\n\u2022\nstrategic consolidation by our customers;\n\u2022\ncancellations and postponements of previously placed orders;\n\u2022\npricing pressure from either our competitors or our customers, resulting in the reduction of our product or service prices, margins or loss of market share;\n\u2022\ndisruptions or delays in the manufacturing of our products or in the supply of components or raw materials that are incorporated into or used to manufacture our products or provide our services, thereby causing us to delay the shipment of products;\n\u2022\ndecreased margins for several or more quarters following the introduction of new products or services, especially as we introduce new subsystems;\n\u2022\ndelays in ramp-up in production, low yields or other problems experienced at our manufacturing facilities in China or Singapore;\n\u2022\nchanges in design-to-delivery cycle times;\n\u2022\ninability to reduce our costs quickly in step with reductions in our prices or in response to decreased demand for our products;\n\u2022\nchanges in our mix of products sold or services;\n\u2022\nwrite-offs of excess or obsolete inventory due to a customer\u2019s bankruptcy or insolvency;\n\u2022\none-time expenses or charges associated with failed acquisition negotiations or completed acquisitions;\n\u2022\ninability to control our operating costs consistent with target levels;\n\u2022\nannouncements by our competitors of new products, services or technological innovations, which may, among other things, render our products less competitive; and\n\u2022\ngeographic mix of customer orders or worldwide earnings.\nAs a result of the foregoing, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our revenue and operating results may not be meaningful and that these comparisons may not be an accurate indicator of our future performance. Changes in the timing or terms of a small number of transactions could disproportionately affect our operating results in any particular quarter. Moreover, our operating results in one or more future quarters may fail to meet our guidance or the expectations of securities analysts or investors. If this occurs, we would expect to experience an immediate and significant decline in the trading price of our common stock.\nWe have established and, as circumstances may require, intend to expand our operations globally, which exposes us to risks associated with operating in foreign countries.\nWe generated approximately 52.1% and 56.7% of our revenues in international markets for fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively. Depending on market conditions, we intend to further expand our operations in Asia and Europe. Through our acquisition of QGT, we expanded our operations to several regions outside of the United States, including in South Korea, Taiwan, Ireland, Scotland and Israel, and increased our operations in China and Singapore. The carrying amount of our fixed assets in Asia and Europe were $81.4 million and $7.5 million, respectively as of December 27, 2019.\nWe are exposed to political, economic, legal and other risks associated with operating in Asia and Europe, including:\n\u2022\nforeign currency exchange fluctuations;\n\u2022\npolitical, civil and economic instability;\n\u2022\nrestrictive governmental actions, such as restrictions on the transfer or repatriation of funds and foreign investments and trade protection measures, including increasing protectionism, import/export restrictions, import/export duties and quotas, trade sanctions and customs duties and tariffs, all of which could increase under the current or future U.S. administration;\n\u2022\nuncertainty regarding social, political and trade policies in the United States and abroad;\n\u2022\ntiming and availability of export licenses;\n\u2022\ndisruptions to our and our customers\u2019 operations due to increased risk of outbreak of diseases;\n\u2022\ndisruptions in operations due to China\u2019s developing domestic infrastructure, including transportation and energy;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in developing relationships with local suppliers;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in attracting new international customers;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in conducting due diligence with respect to business partners in certain international markets;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in accounts receivable collections;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing distant international subsidiaries and branch operations;\n\u2022\nthe burden of complying with foreign and international laws and treaties;\n\u2022\nlegal systems potentially subject to undue influence or corruption; and\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences, including restrictions on the repatriation of earnings to the United States.\nNegative or uncertain global conditions could prevent us from accurately forecasting demand for our products and services which could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, due to generally lower labor and materials costs in the Asian markets in which we currently operate, a shift in the mix of orders from our customers away from such Asian markets or from low cost Asian markets, such as China, to higher cost Asian markets, such as Singapore, could adversely affect our operating margins.\nOur operations in Asia and Europe are also subject to U.S. laws governing the export of equipment. These laws are complex and require us to obtain clearances for the export to Asia and Europe of certain equipment. We may fail to comply with these laws and regulations, which could require us to cease the export of certain equipment and expose us to fines or penalties.\nOver the past several years, the Chinese government has pursued economic reform policies, including the encouragement of private economic activity. The Chinese government may not continue these policies or may significantly alter them to our detriment from time to time without notice. Changes in laws and regulations or their interpretation, the imposition of confiscatory taxation policies, new restrictions on currency conversion or limitations on sources of supply could materially and adversely affect our Chinese operations, which could result in the partial or total loss of our investment in that country and materially and adversely affect our future operating results.\nA significant legal risk associated with conducting business internationally is compliance with the various and differing laws and regulations, including anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws and regulations, of the countries in which we do business, antitrust and competition laws, data privacy laws and export regulations. In addition, the laws in various countries are constantly evolving and may, in some cases, conflict with each other. Although our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and other policies prohibit us, our employees and our agents from engaging in unethical business practices, there can be no assurance that all of our employees or agents will refrain from acting in violation of our related anti-corruption policies and procedures. Any such violation could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nBusiness practices in Asia may entail greater risk and dependence upon the personal relationships of senior management than is common in North America, and therefore some of our agreements with other parties in South Korea and China could be difficult or impossible to enforce.\nThrough our acquisition of QGT, we have expanded our business activities in Asia. The business culture in parts of Asia is, in some respects, different from the business cultures in Western countries. Personal relationships among business principals of companies and business entities in Asia are very significant in their business cultures. In some cases, because so much reliance is based upon personal relationships, written contracts among businesses in Asia may be less detailed and specific than is commonly accepted for similar written agreements in Western countries. In some cases, material terms of an understanding are not contained in the written agreement but exist only as oral agreements. In addition, in contrast to the Western business environment where a written agreement specifically defines the terms, rights and obligations of the parties in a legally-binding and enforceable manner, the parties to a written agreement in Asia may view that agreement more as a starting point for an ongoing business relationship which will evolve and undergo ongoing modification over time. As a result, any contractual arrangements we enter into with a counterparty in Asia may be more difficult to enforce.\nWe could be adversely affected by risks associated with joint ventures, including those in the Asian markets.\nFrom time to time, we may seek to expand our business through investments in joint ventures with complementary businesses, technologies, services or products, subject to our business plans and management\u2019s ability to identify, acquire and develop suitable investments or acquisition targets in both new and existing market categories and geographic markets. Our investments in joint ventures are subject to a number of risks, including many of those described for acquisitions above under Risk Factors-\u201cAcquisitions could result in operating and integration difficulties, dilution, margin deterioration, diversion of management\u2019s attention, and other consequences that may adversely impact our business and results of operations.\u201d. In particular, at the closing of the QGT acquisition, we indirectly became a party to QGT\u2019s joint venture with Cinos Co., Ltd. (\u201cCinos Korea\u201d) in South Korea and Cinos Xi\u2019an in China, which is our first experience with a joint venture. There can be no assurances that the joint ventures will be successful. The success of the joint ventures will require significant management and capital resources and there can be no assurances that such resources will be available. Operations at the joint ventures could expose us to\nincreased risks inherent in such activities, such as protection of our intellectual property, economic and political stability, labor matters, language and cultural differences; contractual enforcement issues; and the need to manage product development, operations and sales activities that are located a long distance from our headquarters and have historically been centralized with local management. In addition, from time to time in the future, our joint venture partners may have economic or business interests or goals that are different from ours. Furthermore, our joint venture with Cinos Korea will require us to make purchases of equity from time to time up to specified amounts. If each joint venture business does not progress according to our plans and anticipated timing, our investment in the joint ventures may not be successful.\nThe industries in which we participate are highly competitive and rapidly evolving, and if we are unable to compete effectively, our operating results will be harmed.\nWe face intense competition from subsystem and component manufacturers in the industries we serve. Increased competition has in the past resulted, and could in the future result, in price reductions, reduced gross margins or loss of market share, any of which would harm our operating results. We are subject to significant pricing pressure as we attempt to maintain and increase market share with our existing customers. Competitors may offer reduced prices or introduce new products for the markets currently served by our products. These products may have better performance, lower prices and achieve broader market acceptance than our products. Further, OEMs typically own the design rights to their products and may provide these designs to other subsystem manufacturers. If our competitors obtain proprietary rights to these designs such that we are unable to obtain the designs necessary to manufacture products for our OEM customers, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected. The cleaning and analytical process are proprietary to QuantumClean\u00ae and ChemTrace\u00ae, respectively, and are subject to less risk from cleaning, coating and analytics competitors. OEMs are looking to increase their maintenance services and could create proprietary cleaning processes with competitors, limiting our ability to compete for future business.\nOur competitors may have greater financial, technical, manufacturing and marketing resources than we do. As a result, they may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, devote greater resources to the development, promotion, sale and support of their products and services, and reduce prices to increase market share. Moreover, there may be merger and acquisition activities among our competitors and potential competitors that may provide our competitors and potential competitors an advantage over us by enabling them to expand their product offerings and service capabilities to meet a broader range of customer needs. Further, if one of our customers develops or acquires the internal capability to develop and produce critical subsystems that we produce, or cleaning, coating and analytical services we provide, the loss of that customer could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. The introduction of new technologies and new market entrants may also increase competitive pressures.\nIf our new products are not accepted by OEMs or other customers or if we are unable to obtain historical margins on our new products, our operating results would be adversely impacted.\nWe design, develop and market critical subsystems and proprietary cleaning, coating and analytical services to OEMs, IDMs and other customers. The introduction of new products and processes is inherently risky because it is difficult to foresee the adoption of new standards, coordinate our technical personnel and strategic relationships and win acceptance of new products by OEMs, IDMs and other customers. We may not be able to recoup design and development expenditures if our new products are not accepted by OEMs, IDMs or other customers. Newly introduced products typically carry lower gross margins than existing products for several or more quarters following their introduction. If any of our new systems or subsystems are not successful in the market, or if we are unable to obtain gross margins on new products that are similar to the gross margins we have historically achieved, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOur business may be adversely affected by information technology, disruptions, including by impairing our ability to effectively deliver our products or services, which could cause us to lose customers and harm our results of operations.\nThe manufacture and delivery of our products, the provision of our services and our financial reporting depends on the continuing operation of our technology infrastructure and systems, particularly our data center located in California. Any damage to or failure of our systems could result in interruptions in our ability to manufacture or deliver products or services on agreed upon lead times, or at all, on a local or worldwide basis, or adversely affect our impact to accurately and timely report our financial results. Interruptions could reduce our sales and profits, and our reputation could be damaged if people believe our systems are unreliable. Our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, terrorist attacks, floods, fires, power loss, hardware or software failures, telecommunications failures, cybersecurity attacks, and similar events. Some of the critical components of our system are not redundant and we currently do not have a backup data center. Accordingly, the risk associated with such events beyond our control is heightened.\nCybersecurity attacks, in particular, are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data (our own or that of third parties). Although we have adopted certain measures to mitigate potential risks to our systems from information technology-related disruptions, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of such disruptions, we could potentially be subject to production downtimes, operational delays, other detrimental impacts on our operations or ability to provide products and services to our customers, the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information, misappropriation, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our systems or networks, financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability, and/or damage to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we experience frequent or persistent system failures, the attractiveness of our products or services to customers could be permanently harmed. Any steps we take to increase the reliability and redundancy of our systems may be expensive, reduce our operating margin and may not be successful in reducing the frequency or duration of unscheduled interruptions.\nIf we were required to impair all or part of our goodwill and/or our acquired intangible assets, our net income and net worth could be materially adversely affected.\nWe had $171.1 million of goodwill recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 27, 2019. Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of net tangible and finite lived, identifiable intangible assets acquired in business combinations. If our market capitalization drops significantly below the amount of net equity recorded on our balance sheet, it could indicate a decline in our value and would require us to further evaluate whether our goodwill has been impaired. During the fourth quarter of each year, we perform an annual review of our goodwill and acquired intangible assets to determine if they have become impaired, however, we also evaluate goodwill and acquired intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If we were required to impair all or a significant part of our goodwill and/or our acquired intangible assets, our financial results and net worth could be materially adversely affected.\nOur business is largely dependent on the know-how of our employees, and we generally do not have an intellectual property position that is protected by patents.\nOur business is largely dependent upon our design, engineering, manufacturing, chemical processing, analytical and testing know-how. We rely on a combination of trade secrets and contractual confidentiality provisions and, to a much lesser extent, patents, copyrights and trademarks to protect our proprietary rights. Confidentiality agreements with our employees and others may not adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information. Accordingly, our intellectual property position is more vulnerable than it would be if it were protected primarily by patents. If we fail to protect our proprietary rights successfully, our competitive position could suffer, which could harm our operating results. We may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our proprietary rights, and, in the event infringement or breach of our proprietary rights occurs, our competitive position in the market may be harmed. In addition, competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies and know-how. Further, since our customers generally own the designs and other intellectual property to the products we manufacture, we cannot prevent them from licensing such designs and other intellectual property to our competitors for the manufacture of such products.\nThird parties have claimed and may in the future claim we are infringing their intellectual property, which could subject us to litigation or licensing expenses, and we may be prevented from selling our products if any such claims prove successful.\nWe have in the past and may in the future receive claims that our products, processes or technologies infringe the patents or other proprietary rights of third parties. In addition, we may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may be applicable to our products. Any litigation regarding our patents or other intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming and divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. The complexity of the technology involved in our products and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation increase these risks. Claims of intellectual property infringement may also require us to enter into costly license agreements. However, we may not be able to obtain licenses on terms acceptable to us, or at all. We also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against the development, manufacture and sale of certain of our products if any such claims prove successful. We also rely on design specifications and other intellectual property of our customers in the manufacture of products for such customers. While our customer agreements generally provide for indemnification of us by our customers if we are subjected to litigation for third-party claims of infringement of such intellectual property, such indemnification provisions may not be sufficient to fully protect us from such claims, or our customers may breach such indemnification obligations to us, which could result in costly litigation to defend against such claims or enforce our contractual rights to such indemnification.\nIf we do not keep pace with developments in the industries we serve and with technological innovation generally, our products may not be competitive.\nRapid technological innovation in the markets we serve requires us to anticipate and respond quickly to evolving customer requirements and could render our current product or service offerings and technology obsolete. Technological innovations are inherently complex. We must devote resources to technology development in order to keep pace with such rapidly evolving technologies. We believe that our future success will depend upon our ability to design, engineer and manufacture products and services that meet the changing needs of our customers. This requires that we successfully anticipate and respond to technological changes in design, engineering and manufacturing processes, as well as cleaning and analytical processes, in a cost-effective and timely manner. If we are unable to integrate new technical specifications into competitive product and service designs, develop the technical capabilities necessary to manufacture new products or provide new services or make necessary modifications or enhancements to existing products or services, our business prospects could be harmed.\nThe timely development of new or enhanced products and services is a complex and uncertain process which requires that we:\n\u2022\ndesign innovative and performance-enhancing features that differentiate our products and services from those of our competitors;\n\u2022\nidentify emerging technological trends in the industries we serve, including new standards for our products and services;\n\u2022\naccurately identify and design new products and services to meet market needs;\n\u2022\ncollaborate with OEMs to design and develop products and IDMs to design and develop services on a timely and cost-effective basis;\n\u2022\nramp-up production of new products, especially new subsystems, in a timely manner and with acceptable yields at acceptable costs;\n\u2022\nsuccessfully manage development production cycles; and\n\u2022\nrespond effectively to technological changes or product or service announcements by others.\nIf we are unsuccessful in keeping pace with technological developments for the reasons above or other reasons, our business prospects, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe must achieve design wins to retain our existing customers and to obtain new customers.\nNew capital equipment typically has a lifespan of several years, and OEMs frequently specify which systems, subsystems, components and instruments are to be used in their equipment. Once a specific system, subsystem, component or instrument is incorporated into a piece of capital equipment, it will likely continue to be incorporated into that piece of equipment for at least several months before the OEM would be in a position to switch to the product of another supplier. IDMs typically establish cleaning, coating, and analytical services as they develop and qualify new chip designs for production. Once a cleaned or coated part has been qualified, the associated refurbishment processes are likely to continue to be used. Accordingly, it is important that our products are designed into the new capital equipment of OEMs and new chip designs, which we refer to as a design win, in order to retain our competitive position with existing customers and to obtain new customers.\nWe incur technology development and sales expenses with no assurance that our products will ultimately be designed into an OEM\u2019s capital equipment. Further, developing new customer relationships, as well as maintaining and increasing our market share with existing customers, requires a substantial investment of our sales, engineering and management resources without any assurance from prospective customers that they will place significant orders. We believe that OEMs and IDMs often consider long-term relationships in selecting and placing orders with suppliers. Accordingly, we may have difficulty achieving design wins from OEMs and IDMs that are not currently our customers. Our operating results and potential growth could be adversely affected if we fail to achieve design wins with leading OEMs and IDMs.\nDefects in our products could damage our reputation, decrease market acceptance of our products, cause the unintended release of hazardous materials, and result in potentially costly litigation, indemnification liability or unexpected warranty claims.\nA number of factors, including design flaws, material and component failures, workmanship issues, contamination in the manufacturing, cleaning, coating or analytical environment, impurities in the materials or chemicals used and unknown sensitivities to process conditions, such as temperature and humidity, as well as equipment failures, may cause our products to contain undetected errors or defects. Problems with our products may:\n\u2022\ncause delays in product introductions and shipments for us or our customers;\n\u2022\nresult in increased costs and diversion of development resources;\n\u2022\ncause us to incur increased charges due to unusable inventory;\n\u2022\nrequire design modifications;\n\u2022\nresult in liability for the unintended release of hazardous materials or other damages to our or our customers\u2019 property;\n\u2022\ncreate claims for rework, replacement and/or damages under our contracts with customers, as well as indemnification claims from customers;\n\u2022\ndecrease market acceptance of, or customer satisfaction with, our products, which could result in decreased sales and product returns; or\n\u2022\nresult in lower yields for semiconductor manufacturers.\nIf any of our products contain defects or have reliability, quality or compatibility problems, our reputation might be damaged and customers might be reluctant to buy our products or services. We may also face a higher rate of product defects as we increase our production levels. Product defects could result in warranty and indemnification liability, the loss of existing customers or impair our ability to attract new customers. In addition, we may not find defects or failures in our products until after they are installed in a manufacturer\u2019s fabrication facility. We may have to invest significant capital and other resources to correct these problems. Our current or potential customers also might seek to recover from us any losses resulting from defects or failures in our products. Hazardous materials flow through and are controlled by our products and an unintended release of these materials could result in serious injury or death. Liability claims could require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or pay significant damages or indemnification claims.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe majority of our international revenues are denominated in U.S. dollars. Many of the costs and expenses associated with our international operations are paid in foreign currencies, including Chinese Renminbi, Singapore dollars, Japanese Yen, South Korean Won and Euro and we expect our exposure to these foreign currencies to increase as we increase production in those facilities. Changes in exchange rates among foreign currencies in which our revenue or costs are denominated and the U.S. dollar may affect our revenue, cost of revenues, operating margins and tax.\nThe Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place.\nThe market for our stock is subject to significant fluctuation.\nThe size of our public market capitalization is relatively small, and the average volume of our shares that are traded is relatively low. The market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations. Among the factors that could affect our stock price are:\n\u2022\nquarterly variations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully introduce new products and services and manage new product transitions;\n\u2022\nchanges in revenue or earnings estimates or publication of research reports by analysts;\n\u2022\nspeculation in the press or investment community;\n\u2022\nstrategic actions by us, our customers or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;\n\u2022\nannouncements relating to any of our key customers, significant suppliers or the semiconductor manufacturing and capital equipment industry generally;\n\u2022\ngeneral market conditions;\n\u2022\nthe effects of war and terrorist attacks; and\n\u2022\ndomestic and international economic or political factors unrelated to our performance.\nThe stock markets in general, and the markets for technology stocks in particular, have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nThe technology labor market is very competitive, and our business will suffer if we are unable to effectively hire, promote and retain key personnel.\nOur future success depends in part on the continued service of our key executive officers, as well as our research, engineering, sales, manufacturing and administrative personnel, most of whom are not subject to employment or non-competition agreements. In addition, competition for qualified personnel in the technology industry is intense, and we operate in geographic locations in which labor markets are particularly competitive.\nOur business is particularly dependent on expertise which only a limited number of engineers possess. The loss of any of our key employees and officers, including our Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Financial Officer, any of our Executive or Senior Vice Presidents or any of our other senior managers, or the failure to attract, promote and retain qualified employees, could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nManagement transition also creates uncertainties and could harm our business. Disruption to our organization as a result of executive management transition could divert the executive management\u2019s attention away from certain key areas of our business and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe challenges of employee retention has also increased during the integration process with the companies we have acquired because of the necessity of combining personnel with varied business backgrounds and combining different corporate cultures and objectives, and several acquired employees, including members of the acquired companies\u2019 senior management, have left our company. The process of integrating operations and making such adjustments could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of one or more of our businesses and the loss of key personnel. Employee uncertainty, lack of focus or turnover during the integration process may also disrupt our businesses.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting which, if not remediated, could adversely affect our reputation, business or stock price.\nBased on our evaluation under the COSO framework as further described under \u201cItem 9A - Controls and Procedures,\u201d our management concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 27, 2019 due to material weaknesses attributable to deficiencies in the design and implementation of business process controls and information technology general controls relating to all relevant accounts and cycles within our Semiconductor Services Business (SSB) segment.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud. In addition, Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires us and our independent registered public accounting firm to evaluate and report on our internal control over financial reporting. The process of designing, implementing, maintaining and updating our internal controls and complying with Section 404 is expensive and time consuming, and requires significant attention from management and company resources. In addition, following the expiration of applicable grace periods, we are required to evaluate and report on the internal controls of the companies we acquire, and the attestation report we are required to obtain from our independent registered public accounting firm must include the internal control over financial reporting of the companies we acquire. Integrating acquired companies\u2019 internal control frameworks into the Company and upgrading acquired companies\u2019 controls to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act has required and will require substantial resources, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully or effectively maintain adequate controls over our financial processes at our acquired companies, or for our consolidated business. Failure to maintain existing or implement new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm our results of operations or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations.\nAlthough the Company has begun the process of executing remediation plans that address the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as described above, we cannot assure you that this will occur within the contemplated timeframe. Moreover, we cannot assure you that we will not identify additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the future. If we are unable to remediate the material weaknesses, our ability to record, process and report financial information accurately, and to prepare financial statements within the time periods specified by the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission, could be adversely affected and could reduce the market\u2019s confidence in our financial statements and harm our stock price.\nIf environmental contamination were to occur in one of our production facilities, we could be subject to substantial liabilities.\nWe use substances regulated under various foreign, domestic, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations in our facilities. In addition, we may not be aware of or in compliance with all environmental laws or regulations that could subject us to liability in the U.S. or internationally. Our failure or inability to comply with existing or future environmental requirements could result in significant remediation and other liabilities, the imposition of fines or the suspension or termination of the production of our services or products, and thus a material adverse impact on our business.\nOur business is subject to the risks of earthquakes, fire, power outages, floods, and other catastrophic events, and to interruption by man-made disruptions, such as terrorism.\nOur facilities could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by natural disasters, including fires and earthquakes. We have facilities in areas with above average seismic activity, such as our facilities in South San Francisco, California, Hayward, California and our Taiwan facilities in Hsinchu and Tainan. If any of our facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay production and shipments, reduce revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility. In addition, we have in the past experienced, and may in the future experience, fires and extended power outages at our facilities, such as the fire that occurred at a plant operated by our joint venture, Cinos Korea, in Balan, Republic of Korea, which we announced on September 19, 2018. We do not carry insurance policies that cover potential losses caused by earthquakes or other natural disasters or power loss.\nIn addition, disruption in supply resulting from natural disasters or other causalities or catastrophic events, such as earthquakes, severe weather such as storms or floods, fires, public health epidemic, labor disruptions, power outages, terrorist attacks or political unrest, may result in certain of our suppliers being unable to deliver sufficient quantities of components or raw materials at all or in a timely manner, disruptions in our operations or disruptions in our customers\u2019 operations. For example, in 2011, the northern region of Japan experienced a severe earthquake followed by a tsunami. These geological events caused significant damage in that region and adversely affected Japan\u2019s infrastructure and economy. Some of our suppliers are located in Japan and they experienced, and may experience in the future, shutdowns or disruptions as a result of these types of events, and their operations may be negatively impacted by these events. Many of our customers and suppliers are also located in California, and may be subject to the same risk of seismic activity as described for us above. Similarly, the novel coronavirus (now called \u201cCOVID-19\u201d) outbreak in Wuhan, China in December 2019 forced the Chinese government to extend the Lunar New Year holidays in certain cities and provinces in China, and forced many others to put travel restrictions to and out of China. Such public health epidemic may adversely affect some of our operations in China, disrupting our manufacturing capacity out of the affected regions.\nTo the extent that natural disasters or other calamities or causalities should result in delays or cancellations of customer orders, or the delay in the manufacture or shipment of our products or services, our business, financial condition and operating results would be adversely affected.\nChanges in tax rates or tax assets and liabilities could affect results of operations.\nAs a global company, we are subject to taxation in the United States and various other countries. Significant judgment is required to determine and estimate worldwide tax liabilities. Our future annual and quarterly tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, including changes in the: (1) applicable tax laws; (2) amount and composition of pre-tax income in countries with differing tax rates; or (3) valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nIn addition, we are subject to regular examination by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, and from time to time we initiate amendments to previously filed tax returns. We regularly assess the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations and amendments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes, which requires estimates and judgments. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, there can be no assurance that the tax authorities will agree with such estimates. We may have to engage in litigation to achieve the results reflected in the estimates, which may be time-consuming and expensive. There can be no assurance that we will be successful or that any final determination will not be materially different from the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nCertain regulations related to conflict minerals could adversely impact our business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act contains provisions to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of certain minerals, known as conflict minerals, originating from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and adjoining countries. As a result, in August 2012 the SEC adopted annual disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies who use conflict minerals mined from the DRC and adjoining countries in their products. These requirements require us to perform ongoing due diligence efforts on our supply chain and require public disclosure of the nature and results of these efforts. We filed our most recent conflict minerals report on Form SD on May 30, 2019 reporting that we could not yet determine whether the conflict minerals we source were, directly or indirectly, used to finance or benefit armed groups in the Covered Countries.\nThere have been and there will be costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements to determine the sources of conflict minerals used in our products and other potential changes to products, processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. Complying with these rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in our products and result in substantial additional costs. As there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering \u201cconflict free\u201d conflict minerals, we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain necessary conflict minerals from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Also, we may face reputational challenges if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflict free or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in our products through the procedures we may implement. In addition, there is uncertainty about the future of the regulations related to conflict minerals as a result of legal challenges and statements by the SEC. If we are unable to comply with these rules, we could be subject to enforcement actions by the SEC and liability under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which could result in material adverse consequences to our business, as well as significant fines and penalties.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they issue an adverse opinion regarding our stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If any of the analysts who cover us issue an adverse opinion regarding our stock, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nWe do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nWe do not intend to declare and pay dividends on UCT\u2019s common stock for the foreseeable future. We currently intend to invest our future earnings, if any, to fund our growth. Additionally, the terms of our credit agreement also restrict our ability to pay dividends. Therefore, you are not likely to receive any dividends on your common stock for the foreseeable future.\nFrom time to time, we may become involved in other litigation and regulatory proceedings, which could require significant attention from our management and result in significant expense to us and disruptions to our business.\nIn addition to any litigation related to our intellectual property rights, we may in the future be named as a defendant from time to time in other lawsuits and regulatory actions relating to our business, such as commercial contract claims, environmental compliance claims, employment claims and tax examinations, some of which may claim significant damages or cause us reputational harm. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings, we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceeding. An unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations or limit our ability to engage in certain of our business activities. In addition, regardless of the outcome of any litigation or regulatory proceeding, such proceedings are often expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to normal business operations and require significant attention from our management. As a result, any such lawsuits or proceedings could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 90097, "SIC": 3674, "TIC": "UCTT"}
