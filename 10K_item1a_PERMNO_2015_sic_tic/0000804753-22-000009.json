{"cik": "804753", "company": "CERNER Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-22", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nRisks Related to the Acquisition of Cerner by Oracle\nThe announcement and pendency of the Merger may result in disruptions to our business. On December 20, 2021, we entered into the Merger Agreement with an affiliate of Oracle, pursuant to which we will be acquired by Oracle. The Merger Agreement generally requires us to operate our business in the ordinary course pending completion of the Merger and restricts us, without Oracle's consent, from taking certain specified actions until the Merger is completed. These restrictions may affect our ability to execute our business strategies and attain financial and other goals and may impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Further, in connection with the pending Merger, our current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with us following the Merger, which may materially adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key personnel while the Merger is pending. Employees may depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with us following the Merger and may depart prior to the completion of the Merger. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that we will be able to attract and retain employees to the same extent that we have been able to in the past. The proposed Merger further could cause disruptions to our business or business relationships, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. Parties with which we have business relationships may experience uncertainty as to the future of such relationships and may delay or defer certain business decisions, seek alternative relationships with third parties or seek to alter their present business relationships with us. Parties with whom we otherwise may have sought to establish business relationships may seek alternative relationships with third parties. The pursuit of the Merger may place a significant burden on management and internal resources. It may also divert management's time and attention from the day-to-day operation of our business and the execution of our other strategic initiatives. This could materially adversely affect our financial results. In addition, we have incurred and will continue to incur other significant costs, expenses and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the proposed Merger, and many of these fees and costs are payable regardless of whether or not the pending Merger is consummated. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business, our financial condition and our results of operations and prospects.\nThe Merger may not be completed within the expected timeframe, or at all, and the failure to complete the Merger could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and the market price of our common stock. There can be no assurance that the Merger will be completed in the expected timeframe, or at all. The Merger Agreement contains conditions that must be satisfied or waived prior to the completion of the Merger, including, among others, the approval or clearance of the Merger under the antitrust and foreign investment laws of certain specified countries. There can be no assurance that all required approvals will be obtained, that the conditions to the completion of the Merger will otherwise be satisfied (or waived, if applicable) or that the Merger Agreement will not be terminated, and, even if all required approvals are obtained and conditions are satisfied (or waived, if applicable), we can provide no assurance as to the terms, conditions and timing of such approvals or that the Merger will be completed in a timely manner or at all. Certain conditions to completion of the Merger are not within our control, and we cannot predict when or if these conditions will be satisfied (or waived, as applicable). Even if required regulatory approvals are obtained, it is possible conditions will be imposed that could result in a material delay in, or the abandonment of, the Merger or otherwise have an adverse effect on us.\nIf the Merger is not completed within the expected timeframe or at all, we may be subject to a number of material risks. The price of our common stock may decline to the extent that current market prices reflect a market assumption that the Merger will be completed. In addition, some costs related to the Merger must be paid whether or not the Merger is completed, and we have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant costs, expenses and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the proposed transaction, as well as the diversion of management and resources towards the Merger, for which we will have received little or no benefit if completion of the Merger does not occur. We may also experience negative reactions from our investors, clients, suppliers, and associates. In addition, if the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain specified circumstances, we will be required to pay Parent a termination fee of $950 million. Additional information about the Offer and Merger and the Merger Agreement is set forth in our filings with the SEC.\nStockholder litigation could prevent or delay the closing of the Merger or otherwise negatively impact our business, operating results and financial condition. We may incur additional costs in connection with current or any future stockholder litigation in connection with the Merger. Such litigation may adversely affect our ability to complete the Merger. We could incur significant costs in connection with any such litigation, including attorneys' fees and costs associated with the indemnification obligations to our directors.\nTable of Content\nCOVID-19 Risks\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has affected how we and our customers are operating our respective businesses, and the duration and extent to which this will impact our future results of operations remains uncertain. Continuing efforts to control the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic or the resurgence thereof have significantly curtailed the movement of people, goods and services worldwide, including in most or all of the regions in which we sell our software, healthcare devices, technology-enabled services or other services (collectively referred to as \"Products and Services\") and conduct our business operations. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused us to modify certain of our business practices, including prolonging the requirement that most of our associates work remotely; restricting associate travel; mandating vaccines for our associates; developing social distancing plans for our associates; and canceling or postponing in person participation in certain meetings, events and conferences, and we may take further actions as required by government authorities, our clients or as determined to be in the best interests of our associates, clients and business partners. These measures and our clients' focus on the pandemic have also resulted in delays in marketing, selling and implementing our Products and Services. There is no certainty that these measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus and our ability to perform critical functions could be harmed. Further, there can be no assurances that our mitigation measures, such as mandating vaccines for our U.S.-based associates, will not have a negative impact on our business. The magnitude and duration of the disruption and potential ongoing impact on business activity is uncertain. In particular, we have experienced and may continue to experience a negative financial impact due to a number of factors, including without limitation:\n\u2022Cerner's efforts and investments in assisting its clients in their response to the pandemic;\n\u2022Reduced new business bookings as our clients focus on helping their patients during the crisis, rather than making new or expanded purchasing decisions, and longer-term declines in bookings for new Products and Services to the extent that the pandemic will continue to contribute to sustained global or U.S. economic downturns;\n\u2022Delays in implementing our Products and Services, including delays in the pace of completion of existing projects, while client resources are reallocated or dedicated to fighting the COVID-19 pandemic or the resurgence thereof, and supply chain interruptions;\n\u2022Financial pressures being put on our clients, which may in turn result in a delay in collections or non-payment from our clients; and\n\u2022Financial pressures being put on our strategic investments for which we hold an equity interest increases the risk of asset impairment.\nAlthough we experienced some ongoing challenges in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic during 2021, at this time, we have not experienced a negative impact on our liquidity, access to capital or overall operations. While we generally expect continued impact from COVID-19 in 2022, we are unable to predict the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the nature and timing of when full demand recovery may occur. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may experience material adverse impacts to our business as a result of the global and U.S. economic impact and any recession that has occurred or may occur in the future. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic or our measures taken in response thereto adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described below.\nCybersecurity and Information Technology Risks\nWe may experience interruptions at our data centers or client support facilities, which could interrupt clients' access to their data, exposing us to significant costs and reputational harm. We perform data center and hosting services for certain clients, including the collection and storage of critical patient and administrative data and the provision of support services. We rely on the secure electronic transmission, processing and storage of sensitive information, including protected health information; personally identifiable information; financial information; and other sensitive information relating to our clients and their patients, our company and our third-party suppliers. We also use public cloud providers and other third parties in connection with hosting our own data. A catastrophic failure of our backup generators during a prolonged public utility power outage; an impairment of telecommunications lines; a successful concerted denial of service attack; a significant system, network or data breach; damage, injury or impairment to the buildings, equipment, personnel operating such facilities or the client data contained therein; or errors by the personnel operating such facilities could cause a disruption in operations and negatively impact our clients. System redundancy, disaster recovery and other continuity measures may be inadequate. Any interruption, damage or breach of our systems or with those of third parties on which we rely, such as our cloud service providers, could damage our reputation, cause us to lose existing clients, hurt\nTable of Content\nour ability to obtain new clients, result in significant revenue loss, create potential liabilities, increase our operating costs and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nA security breach could subject us to increased expenses, legal exposure and regulatory actions, and clients and prospective clients could be deterred from using our Products and Services. Our Products and Services require us to store, retrieve, process and manage our clients' information and data (and that of their patients), as well as our own data. Persons with authorized access, both associates and third parties, may use such access to harm the Company. Persons outside of our organization may attempt to identify and exploit Product and Service vulnerabilities, penetrate or bypass our security measures, and gain unauthorized access to our software, hardware and cloud offerings, networks and systems, or those of our clients and suppliers, any of which could lead to disruptions in mission-critical systems or the unauthorized release or corruption of protected health information, personally identifiable information, financial information or other sensitive information, or the confidential information or data of Cerner, our clients or their patients, or our suppliers. We may be targeted by computer hackers because we are a prominent healthcare IT company and have high profile clients, including government clients. Additionally, our clients and their employees may be targeted by hackers who compromise their credentials and lead to unauthorized access to their systems hosted in our data centers or third-party cloud service providers. These risks may increase as we continue to grow our cloud offerings, collect, store and process increasingly large amounts of our clients' confidential data, including protected health information and sensitive personal data, and host or manage parts of our clients' businesses in cloud-based/multi-tenant IT environments. We also use third party public cloud providers in connection with certain client facing cloud-based offerings and to host our own data. There can be no assurance that our policies, procedures, and controls or those of third parties on which we rely will detect or prevent all of these threats and we cannot predict the full impact of any such past or future incident.\nThe costs we would incur to address and remediate these security incidents would increase our expenses. Our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss of existing or potential clients that may impede our sales, development of solutions, provision of services or other critical functions. If a cyber-attack or other security incident were to allow unauthorized access to or modification of data or our IT systems, or if our Products or Services are perceived as having security vulnerabilities, we could suffer significant damage to our brand and reputation. This in turn could lead to fewer clients using our Products and Services and result in reduced revenue and earnings. These types of security incidents could also lead to lawsuits, regulatory investigations and claims and, in some cases, contractual costs related to notification and fraud monitoring. There can be no assurance that our cyber risk insurance will adequately cover all our losses from any future security breaches or remain available on acceptable terms, if at all.\nOperating and Product Risks\nWe may be subject to claims for system errors and warranties or incur substantial costs related to product and service-related liabilities. Many of our Products and Services are intended for use in collecting, storing and displaying clinical and healthcare-related information used in the diagnosis and treatment of patients and in related healthcare settings such as registration, scheduling and billing. Our Products and Services, or the third-party software products or services incorporated therein, may contain design, coding or other errors, especially when first introduced. Similarly, errors in the implementation and configuration can occur and have occurred in the past. These errors could affect the ability of our Products and Services to properly function, integrate or operate with other offerings, scale to meet the needs of our clients, create vulnerabilities and adversely affect market acceptance. If the timely delivery of medical care or other customer business requirements are impaired by data access, network or systems problems, we could be exposed to legal liability and reputational harm. Healthcare professionals delivering patient care tend to have heightened sensitivity to system and software errors and impairments of reliability and stability of systems. If our Products and Services are alleged to have contributed to faulty clinical decisions, injury to patients based on failure to provide reliable and stable uptime, or negative financial impact to clients, we might be subject to claims or litigation by users of our Products and Services or their patients. Errors or failures might damage our reputation and negatively affect future sales. Any such problems might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations.\nOur client agreements typically provide warranties concerning material errors and other matters. Our failure to meet these warranties could allow the client to terminate the agreement and possibly obtain a refund or damages or both, require us to incur additional expense to correct such failure, subject us to claims, damage our reputation and negatively affect future sales. We attempt to contractually limit our liability; however, these contractual limitations may not be enforceable or otherwise protect us from liability. We may also be subject to claims that are not covered by contract. There is no assurance that our liability insurance will adequately cover any claim or remain available on acceptable terms, if at all. If we are uninsured or under-insured for any such claim, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be\nTable of Content\nmaterially harmed. Product and service-related claims, even if not successful, could damage our reputation, result in the loss of existing or potential clients, divert management's attention, result in significant revenue loss, create potential liabilities for our clients and us and increase our operational costs.\nOur proprietary technology may be subject to claims for infringement or misappropriation of intellectual property rights of others, or our intellectual property rights may be infringed or misappropriated by others or our software may be subject to claims related to open source software licenses. We rely upon a combination of confidentiality practices and policies, contractual arrangements and technical security measures to maintain the confidentiality and trade secrecy of our proprietary information. We also rely on trademark, copyright and patent laws to protect our intellectual property rights. Despite these efforts, we may not be able to adequately protect against theft, copying, reverse engineering, misappropriation, infringement or unauthorized use or disclosure of our intellectual property, which could have an adverse effect on our competitive position. In addition, we are occasionally involved in intellectual property infringement or misappropriation claims. These claims, even if unmeritorious, are expensive to defend and are often incapable of prompt resolution. If we are unsuccessful in defending these claims, we could be required to pay a substantial damage award, develop alternative technology, obtain a license or cease using, selling, offering for sale, licensing, implementing or supporting the applicable Products and Services. We rely upon open source software in our Products and Services. We may encounter claims alleging unauthorized use of the software purported to be licensed under open source terms, demanding release of derivative works of open source software that could include our proprietary source code, or otherwise seeking to enforce the terms of the applicable open source licenses. These claims could result in litigation and, even if unmeritorious, could be expensive to defend and incapable of prompt resolution. We could also be required to make our software source code available under the applicable open source license, utilize or develop alternative technology, or cease using, selling or supporting the applicable Products and Services if we are unsuccessful in defending such claims.\nWe may become involved in legal proceedings that could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition, and our inability or failure to effectively manage publicity related to such claims or legal proceedings could adversely impact our business. From time to time and in the ordinary course of our business, we may become involved in various legal proceedings and claims, including for example, those relating to employment practices, solution and implementation defects, personal injury, torts, intellectual property infringement, violations of law and breaches of contract and warranties. All disputes and legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable. And, regardless of the merits of the claims, litigation may lead to negative publicity and may be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to our operations and distracting to management. If resolved against us, legal proceedings could result in excessive judgments, injunctive relief or other equitable relief that may affect how we operate our business. Any settlements of disputes or legal proceedings may also affect how we operate our business. There can be no assurance that our liability insurance will adequately cover any judgment or settlement or remain available on acceptable terms, if at all. If we incur liability that exceeds our insurance coverage or that is not within the scope of the coverage, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, the dissemination of information via social media, including information about alleged harassment, discrimination or other claims, could harm our business, brand, reputation, financial condition, and results of operations, regardless of the information's accuracy.\nWe are subject to risks associated with our global operations. We market, sell and support our Products and Services globally. We periodically evaluate entering into new markets, whether organically or by acquisition, and adjusting our focus in certain existing markets. For example, in connection with the acquisition of the Kantar Health business, we acquired business in, among other countries, new markets such as China and Taiwan. Significant management attention and financial resources are required to address the risks noted below associated with new market entry into non-U.S. markets, including the noted markets above, and potential disruptions if we chose to adjust our focus in a given market. Non-U.S. operations are subject to inherent risks, and our business, results of operations and financial condition, including our revenue growth and profitability, could be adversely affected by a variety of uncontrollable and changing factors. These include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022Greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods;\n\u2022Difficulties and costs of staffing and managing non-U.S. operations and labor disruptions;\n\u2022Effects of sovereign debt conditions, including budgetary constraints, or health service provider or government spending patterns or government-imposed austerity measures;\n\u2022Legal compliance costs or business risks associated with our global operations, such as: i) local laws and customs differing from, or more stringent than those in the United States, such as those relating to data protection and data security, trade protection measures and intellectual property rights, ii) heightened risk with respect to\nTable of Content\nlaws prohibiting improper payments and bribery, including without limitation the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Anti-Bribery Act and similar laws and regulations in foreign jurisdictions, iii) export control regulations, iv) different or additional functionality requirements or preferences, or v) certification (e.g. CE marking for medical device software), licensing or regulatory requirements and unexpected changes to those requirements;\n\u2022The United Kingdom's withdrawal of its membership from the European Union (\"EU\") (Brexit) and associated uncertainty and disruptions relating thereto;\n\u2022Natural disasters, war, terrorist acts or political unrest which may impact sales or threaten the safety of associates or our continued presence in these countries and the related potential impact on global stability;\n\u2022Our ability to form relationships with local partners, which help us to offer our Products and Services at scale, and our reliance on these partners whose reputation may not be regarded as highly outside the United States; and\n\u2022The increased risks, especially with respect to perceived corruption, cybersecurity threats and IP protection rights, in certain new markets such as China and Taiwan.\nWe operate in intensely competitive and dynamic industries, and our ability to successfully compete depends on our ability to anticipate or respond quickly to market changes and to bring competitive new Products and Services and features to market in a timely fashion. The IT industry and the market for our Products and Services are intensely competitive, dynamically evolving and subject to rapid technological advances and innovative enhancements, changing delivery and pricing models, evolving standards in computer hardware and software development and communications infrastructure, and changing and increasingly sophisticated client needs. We compete on the basis of a number of factors, including breadth and depth of services, including our open architecture and the level of product integration across care settings; integrated platform; regulatory compliance; reputation; reliability, accuracy and security; client service; total cost of ownership; innovation; and industry acceptance, expertise and experience. Development of new proprietary Products or Services is complex, entails significant time and expense, may not be successful and often involves a long return on investment cycle. We cannot guarantee that the market for our Products and Services will continue to grow or that we will be able to successfully introduce new Products or Services. We provide solutions to clients via various deployment models, including client-server-based solutions and cloud-based offerings.\nIn addition, we expect that major software information systems companies, highly capitalized consumer technology companies, large information technology consulting service providers and system integrators, start-up companies and others operating in the healthcare industry may offer competitive Products and Services. As we continue to develop new Products and Services to address areas such as analytics, machine learning (\"ML\"), artificial intelligence (\"AI\"), value-based care, consumer solutions, population health management and other health network solutions, we expect to face new competitors, and these competitors may have more experience in these markets, better brand recognition or more established relationships with prospective clients. Moreover, we expect that competition will continue to increase as a result of consolidation in both the IT and healthcare industries. We face strong competition and often face downward price pressure, which could adversely affect our results of operations or liquidity. If we do not adapt our pricing models to reflect changes in use of our Products and Services or changes in client demand, our revenues could decrease.\nOur success also depends on our ability to maintain and expand our business with our existing clients and effectively transition existing clients to current Products and Services, as well as attracting additional clients. Certain clients originally purchased one or a limited number of our Products and Services. These clients may choose not to expand their use of or purchase new Products and Services. Failure to retain and generate additional business from our current clients could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, there are a limited number of hospitals and other healthcare providers in the U.S. market, and the healthcare industry has been subject to increasing consolidation, which can cause fewer new footprint opportunities or lead to the replacement of our Products and Services in existing clients if the acquiror (or the group being acquired) has a relationship with a different Health Information Technology (HIT) provider. If we are unable to adapt to the impact of industry consolidation, falling costs and technological advancements in a timely manner, our prospects and financial results could be negatively affected.\nWe may continue complementary strategic business acquisitions and strategic investments to expand our Products and Services offerings and grow our market and client base. Acquisitions and strategic investments have inherent risks which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or prospects, including, but not limited to: 1) diversion of our management's attention; 2) investment in or entry into markets in which we have little or no direct prior experience; 3) failure to achieve projected synergies; 4) failure to commercialize \"go forward\" Products and Services; 5) failure to successfully integrate the business; 6) loss of clients, key personnel, suppliers and other important relationships; 7) incurrence of debt or assumption of known and unknown liabilities; 8) write-off of software development costs, goodwill, client lists and amortization of expenses related to intangible assets; 9)\nTable of Content\ndilutive issuances of equity securities; 10) accounting deficiencies relating to the acquisition of an acquired company, including issues related to internal control over financial reporting and the time and cost associated with remedying such deficiencies; and 11) litigation related to acquisition activity. Further, when we make a strategic investment, we have to rely on third party management teams to drive the portfolio company's success and at times infuse additional capital or provide bridge loans to protect our investment. If we fail to successfully integrate acquired businesses or fail to implement our business strategies with respect to our acquisitions or investments, we may not be able to achieve projected results or support the amount of consideration paid for such acquired businesses or invested into a portfolio company.\nIf we are unable to manage our growth in the new markets in which we offer Products and Services, our business, results of operations and financial condition could suffer. Our future financial results will depend on our ability to profitably manage our business in the new markets that we enter. We expect to pursue growth and expansion opportunities in the areas of analytics, ML, AI, value-based care, consumer solutions, population health and other health network solutions. To achieve success in those areas, we will need to, among other things, recruit, train, retain and effectively manage associates, manage changing business conditions and implement and improve our technical, administrative, financial control and reporting systems for offerings in those areas. Difficulties in managing future growth in new markets could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nLong sales cycles for our Products and Services could have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations. Some of our Products and Services have long sales cycles, ranging from several months to eighteen months or more beginning at initial contact with the client through execution of a contract. Implementing, replacing, or expanding an information system, or modifying, adding or outsourcing business processes, are major decisions for healthcare organizations. Many of the Products and Services we provide require a substantial capital investment and time commitments by the client or prospective client. Any decision by our clients or prospective clients to delay a purchasing decision could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWe depend on strategic relationships and third-party suppliers and our revenue and operating earnings could suffer if we fail to manage these relationships properly. To be successful, we must continue to maintain our existing strategic relationships and establish additional strategic relationships as necessary with leaders in the markets in which we operate. As we decide to partner rather than directly provide certain Products and Services, we will become more dependent on these strategic relationships to meet our clients' needs. We believe that these relationships contribute to our ability to further build our brand, extend the reach of our Products and Services, develop and deploy new products and services, and generate additional revenues and cash flows. The loss of a critical strategic relationship or failure to establish additional relationships, or the failure to realize anticipated synergies and benefits of these strategic relationships, including as a result of delays, shortages or increasing costs in our supply chain, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe license or purchase certain intellectual property and technology (such as software, services, hardware and content) from third parties, including some competitors, and depend on such intellectual property and technology in the operation and delivery of our Products and Services. Additionally, we sell or license third party intellectual property and technology in conjunction with our Products and Services. Our remote hosting and cloud services businesses also rely on a limited number of software and services suppliers for certain functions of these businesses. Most of our third-party software license support contracts expire within one to five years, can be renewed only by mutual consent and may be terminated if we breach the terms of the license and fail to cure the breach within a specified period of time. Most of these third-party software licenses are non-exclusive; therefore, our competitors may obtain the right to use the technology covered by these licenses to compete directly with us. If our third party suppliers were to change product offerings, cease actively supporting the technologies, fail to update and enhance the technologies, encounter technical difficulties in developing these technologies, significantly increase prices, change delivery models, terminate our licenses or supply contracts or suffer significant capacity or supply chain constraints or disruptions, we may need to seek alternative suppliers and incur additional internal or external development costs to ensure continued performance of our Products and Services. Such alternatives may not be available on attractive terms or may not be as widely accepted or as effective as the intellectual property or technology provided by our existing suppliers. In addition, interruption in functionality of our Products and Services as a result of changes in third party suppliers could adversely affect our commitments to clients, future sales of Products and Services, and negatively affect our revenue and operating earnings.\nOur success depends upon the recruitment and retention of key personnel. Members of our senior management team and other key personnel have departed the Company during the past few years for a variety of reasons, and we cannot guarantee that there will not be additional departures. To remain competitive, we must attract, motivate and retain highly skilled managerial, sales, marketing, consulting and technical personnel, including key personnel skilled in the\nTable of Content\nindustries and technical environments in which our Products and Services are offered. As we modernize our core platforms, it is important that we retain and attract experienced technical talent with cloud expertise to lead this transformation. Competition for such personnel in our industries is intense in both the United States and abroad. Our failure to attract additional qualified personnel and to retain and motivate existing personnel to meet our needs could have a material adverse effect on our prospects for long-term growth. We may also experience increased compensation costs that are not offset by either improved productivity or higher sales. The unexpected loss of key personnel, or the failure to successfully develop and execute effective succession planning to assure smooth transitions of those key associates and their knowledge, relationships and expertise, could disrupt our business and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition, and could potentially inhibit development and delivery of our Products and Services and market share advances.\nWe might not be successful in achieving expected operating efficiencies and sustaining or improving operating expense reductions and might experience business disruptions and adverse tax consequences associated with restructuring, realignment and cost reduction activities. Cerner has implemented and plans to continue to implement several restructuring and realignment initiatives to reduce costs and increase operating efficiencies. There can be no assurance that we will realize, in full or in part, the anticipated benefits of these initiatives. If we are unable to deliver on these initiatives, while continuing to invest in business growth, or if the volume and nature of change overwhelms available resources, our business operations and financial results could be materially and adversely impacted. Our ability to successfully manage and execute these initiatives and realize expected savings and benefits in the amounts and at the times anticipated is important to our business success. Any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, our ability to achieve our other strategic goals and business plans might be adversely affected and we could experience business disruptions with clients and elsewhere if our restructuring and realignment efforts and our cost reduction activities prove ineffective.\nRegulatory Risks\nThe healthcare industry is subject to changing political, economic and regulatory influences, which could impact the purchasing practices and operations of our clients and increase our costs to deliver Products and Services that enable our clients to meet their compliance requirements. Many healthcare providers are consolidating to create integrated healthcare delivery systems with greater market power. These providers may try to use their market power to negotiate price reductions for our Products and Services. As the healthcare industry consolidates, our client base could be consolidated with fewer buyers, competition for clients could become more intense and the importance of maintaining and acquiring new client relationships becomes greater.\nThe last decade has been quite active legislatively with major statutes such as the Protecting Access to Medicare Act (PAMA) of 2014 establishing requirements for \"Appropriate Use Criteria\" in ordering high dollar diagnostic imaging services, the Medicare and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 which reformed how physicians are paid under Medicare and which established the Merit-based Incentive Payment System (MIPS); the 21st Century Cures Act of 2016 (Cures Act), which laid the groundwork for a nationwide trusted health information exchange, established interoperability requirements for providers, payers and consumers, and set the framework for information blocking regulations; and most recently the Substance Use Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities (SUPPORT) Act of 2018 that includes significant policies for addressing the opioid crisis. These statutes are heavily laden with provisions that directly call for or describe roles for the use of health information technology to help providers comply with new federal requirements under Medicare and state Medicaid programs.\nReform of payment policies for Medicare and Medicaid continues to evolve. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act became law in 2010; this comprehensive healthcare reform legislation introduced value-based principles into federal health insurance payments systems, sought to improve healthcare quality, and expanded access to affordable health insurance. MACRA built upon the value based policies introduced by the ACA. These legislative initiatives accelerated the adoption of \"Alternative Payment Models\" (APMs) as bundled payment models based on episodes of care or per capita payment for defined populations as alternatives to traditional fee for service payments to providers. New APMs continue to be developed under the authorities of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Innovations, and value-based efforts such as the Medicare Shared Savings Program Accountable Care Organization (MSSP ACO) program have seen various iterations. APMs have evolved to usually require two-sided risk (shared saving and shared losses) and use of Certified EHR Technology (CEHRT) as a precondition for program participation. However, even after failed attempts to repeal the ACA, continuing challenges in the courts create uncertainty for the continued implementation of the ACA. Given a fractious and polarized legislative environment at the federal level, the near-term prospects for healthcare related legislation face uncertainty. Because of ongoing federal fiscal budgetary pressures yet to be resolved for federal health\nTable of Content\nprograms, we cannot predict the full effect of healthcare legislation on our business at this time. The direction and pace of healthcare reform initiatives may adversely impact either our operational results or the way we operate our business. We expect expanded surveillance by federal agencies of certified HIT and its use by our clients. We also anticipate newly expanded regulations under the federal Self-Referral and Anti-Kickback Laws that will contain expanded safe harbors for value based care, and that may promote expanded donation of certified HIT and of cybersecurity technologies in support of trusted health information exchange to support coordinated patient care within value based APMs. In response to this uncertainty, purchasers of HIT may elect to update HIT already in use and postpone investment decisions in new or replacement HIT, including investments in our Products and Services. Future legislation and regulation together with future judicial decisions may ultimately impact the fiscal stability and sustainability of HIT purchasers. Differences in demand related to new regulatory requirements and near-term compliance deadlines that contribute to demand for our Products and Services could impact our financial results. There can be no certainty that any legislation that may be adopted or judicial decisions will be favorable to our business. We cannot predict whether or when future healthcare reform initiatives at the federal or state level or other initiatives affecting our business will be proposed, enacted or implemented or what impact those initiatives may have on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe healthcare industry is highly regulated, and thus, we are subject to several laws, regulations and industry initiatives, non-compliance with certain of which could materially adversely affect our operations or otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. As a participant in the healthcare industry, our operations and relationships, and those of our clients, are regulated by several U.S. federal, state, local and foreign governmental entities. The impact of these regulations on us is both direct, to the extent that we are ourselves subject to these laws and regulations, and also indirect, in terms of government program requirements applicable to our clients for the use of HIT. Even though we may not be directly regulated by specific healthcare laws and regulations, our Products and Services must be capable of being used by our clients in a way that complies with those laws and regulations. There are a significant and wide-ranging number of regulations both within the United States and abroad, such as regulations in the areas of healthcare fraud, information sharing, e-prescribing, claims processing and transmission, healthcare devices, the security and privacy of patient data and interoperability standards, that may be directly or indirectly applicable to our operations and relationships or the business practices of our clients. Specific risks include, but are not limited to, the following:\nHealthcare Fraud. U.S. federal and state governments continue to enhance regulation of and increase their scrutiny over practices involving healthcare fraud, waste and abuse perpetuated by healthcare providers and professionals whose services are reimbursed by Medicare, Medicaid and other government healthcare programs. Our healthcare provider clients, as well as our provision of Products and Services to government entities, subject our business to laws and regulations on fraud and abuse which, among other things, prohibit the direct or indirect payment or receipt of any remuneration for patient referrals, or arranging for or recommending referrals or other business paid for in whole or in part by these federal or state healthcare programs. U.S. federal enforcement personnel have substantial funding, powers and remedies to pursue suspected or perceived fraud and abuse. The effect of this government regulation on our clients is difficult to predict. Many of the regulations applicable to our clients and that may be applicable to us, including those relating to marketing incentives offered in connection with healthcare device sales and information blocking, are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts. They may be interpreted or applied by prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authorities in a manner that could broaden their applicability to us or require our clients to make changes in their operations or the way in which they deal with us. If we fail to comply with any applicable laws and regulations, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties, sanctions or other liability, including exclusion from government health programs or from providing certain Products and Services to our clients who participate in such programs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Even an unsuccessful challenge by a regulatory or prosecutorial authority of our activities could result in adverse publicity, require a costly response from us and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nPreparation, Transmission, Submission and Collection of Medical Claims for Reimbursement. Our Products and Services are capable of electronically transmitting claims for services and items rendered by a physician to many patients' payers for approval and reimbursement. Such claims are governed by U.S. federal and state laws. U.S. federal law provides civil liability to any persons that knowingly submit, or cause to be submitted, a claim to a payer, including Medicare, Medicaid and private health plans, seeking payment for any services or items that overbills or bills for services or items that have not been provided to the patient. U.S. federal law may also impose criminal penalties for intentionally submitting such false claims. In addition, federal and state law regulates the collection of debt and may impose monetary penalties for violating those regulations. We have policies and procedures in place that we believe result in the accurate and complete preparation, transmission, submission and collection of claims, provided that the information given to us by our clients is also accurate and complete. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\"HIPAA\") security, privacy\nTable of Content\nand transaction standards, as discussed below, also have a potentially significant effect on our claims preparation, transmission and submission services, because those services must be structured and provided in a way that supports our clients' HIPAA compliance obligations. In connection with these laws, we may be subjected to U.S. federal or state government investigations and possible penalties may be imposed upon us; false claims actions may have to be defended; private payers may file claims against us; and we may be excluded from Medicare, Medicaid or other government-funded healthcare programs. Any investigation or proceeding related to these laws, even if unwarranted or without merit, may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRegulation of Healthcare Devices. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") has determined that certain of our Products and Services are covered medical devices that are actively regulated under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (\"Act\") and amendments to the Act. Other countries have similar regulations in place related to medical devices, that now or may in the future apply to certain of our Products and Services. The FDA has also expressed an intention to update its regulatory framework to address AI/ML-based Software as a Medical Device. If other of our Products and Services are deemed to be actively regulated medical devices by the FDA or similar regulatory agencies in countries where we do business, we could be subject to extensive requirements governing pre- and post-marketing activities including pre-market notification clearance. Complying with these medical device regulations globally is time consuming and expensive and could be subject to unanticipated and significant delays. Further, it is possible that these regulatory agencies may become more active in regulating software and devices that are used in healthcare. If we are unable to obtain the required regulatory approvals for any such Products and Services, our short- and long-term business plans for these Products and Services could be delayed or canceled. Our sites have been previously subject to FDA inspections, and we remain subject to periodic FDA inspections. We could be required to undertake additional actions to comply with the Act and any other applicable regulatory requirements. Our failure to comply with the Act and any other applicable regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to manufacture, distribute and deliver our Products and Services.\nSecurity and Privacy. U.S. federal, state and local laws and foreign legislation govern the confidentiality of personal information, how that information may be used, and the circumstances under which such information may be released. These regulations govern both the disclosure and use of confidential personal and patient medical record information and require the users of such information to implement specified security and privacy measures. U.S. regulations currently in place governing electronic health data transmissions continue to evolve and are often unclear and difficult to apply in light of the complexity of our client environments. Laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions are also evolving and often have stricter requirements related to the treatment of personal or patient information.\nData protection regulations impact how businesses, including both us and our clients, can collect and process the personal data of individuals. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, such laws, regulations and policies, or modifications thereto, that are applicable to us may limit the use and adoption of our Products and Services and could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, we incur development, resource, and capital costs in delivering, updating, and supporting Products and Services to enable our U.S. and non-U.S. clients to comply with these varying and evolving standards. U.S. federal, state, and non-U.S. governmental enforcement personnel have substantial powers and remedies, particularly in the EU, to pursue suspected or perceived violations. If we fail to comply with any applicable laws or regulations or fail to deliver compliant Products and Services, we could be subject to civil penalties, sanctions and contract liability and could otherwise damage our reputation. Enforcement investigations, even if meritless, could have a negative impact on our reputation, cause us to lose existing clients or limit our ability to attract new clients.\nIn the U.S., HIPAA regulations apply national standards for some types of electronic health information transactions and the data elements used in those transactions to ensure the integrity, security and confidentiality of health information and standards to protect the privacy of individually identifiable health information. Covered entities under HIPAA, which include healthcare organizations such as our clients, and their business associates, many of our employer clinic business and our claims processing, transmission and submission services, are required to comply with HIPAA privacy standards, transaction regulations and security regulations. We and our U.S. clients are also subject to evolving state laws regarding the privacy and security of healthcare information and personal information generally.\nIn non-U.S. jurisdictions, we are subject to transnational, national and local data protection legislation, including, but not limited to, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\"), UK GDPR, Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act and Canadian Provincial legislation. In addition to EU and Canadian federal legislation, certain European member states and Canadian provinces have adopted more stringent data protection standards, particularly for health data. These regulations may impose restrictions on the processing of personal data (including health\nTable of Content\ndata) that, in some respects, are more stringent, and impose more significant burdens on subject businesses, than current privacy standards in the United States.\nIn non-U.S. jurisdictions, we also are subject to potential restrictions on cross-border transfers of personal data to the United States as well as other countries where Cerner has business operations. A recent EU court decision regarding the adequacy of U.S. law to protect EU personal data created additional uncertainty regarding the lawfulness of transfers of EU personal data to the United States and India. Cerner has addressed these requirements through the execution of Standard Contractual Clause Agreements and by designing our support services to minimize, to the extent feasible, transfers of our EU client's patient data to the United States. However, the adoption of data privacy laws and court decisions that restrict cross border transfers or otherwise require data localization could have a material impact on our business. Furthermore, the perception by non-U.S. clients that we cannot provide adequate assurance for transfers of personal information may limit the use and adoption of our Products and Services and could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nDevelopment and adoption of ML and AI technologies offer the potential to significantly improve the delivery of healthcare. The application of ML and AI technologies to personal and patient information may be regulated under some privacy laws (e.g. GDPR). Furthermore, the lack of standards for measuring the accuracy and effectiveness of ML and AI can raise new or exacerbate existing technological, legal or other challenges that could impact our reputation and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nFederal Requirements for Use of Interoperable and Certified Health Information Technology. Various U.S. federal, state and non-government agencies continue to generate requirements for the use of certified health information technology and interoperability standards. These requirements are expansions of the statutory ARRA HITECH program that began providing incentive payments in 2011 to hospitals and eligible providers for the \"meaningful use of certified electronic health record technology (\"CEHRT\").\" Although those incentive programs have expired, CEHRT continues to be a requirement of participation in federal healthcare programs in order to receive reimbursement for health items and services provided by our clients to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. In the last several years, participation in Medicare's \"alternative payment models\" to replace traditional \"fee for service\" payments with quality and risk-sharing payment models has been conditioned on the adoption of CEHRT. The Cures Act has tied CEHRT to its policy goals of reducing barriers to the exchange of health information, encouraging nationwide interoperability, consumer access to health information and improving health information availability between consumers and their care teams. The regulations establishing the certification and interoperability standards for CEHRT will continue to be updated to support these policy goals with greater emphasis on interoperability, consumer engagement, patient safety and health information privacy and security.\nAlong with recent CMS actions taken for Medicare and Medicaid, these regulations will also mandate adoption of updated and expanded certified capabilities of CEHRT that our clients must adopt to remain able to participate in the federal programs mentioned earlier. In addition, the ONC has increased its surveillance activities concerning vendor compliance relative to CEHRT.\nCerner will be completing software development updates to its certified products and taking them through ONC's certification process in 2022 to meet the new certification requirements that will become mandatory for certain Federal programs under the Cures Act and various CMS regulations. Given recent CMS regulations, these updates must become certified and adopted by our clients by January 1, 2023. However, these standards and specifications are subject to interpretation by the entities designated to certify our electronic healthcare technology as CEHRT compliant. Additionally, the Cures Act requires us to comply with conditions of certification such that if our business practices or our Products and Services are not compliant with these evolving regulatory requirements, our market position and sales could be impaired, we may have to invest significantly in changes to our Products and Services, and our reputation could be damaged. Further, we bear potential financial risks where we are alleged to have not appropriately complied with these regulations. We also bear financial risk where we have entered into agreements with clients to warrant our ability to provide certified Products and Services. While a client's ability to meet future federal health program related attestation requirements may be dependent on the client's ability to adopt, rollout and attain sufficient use of our certified Products and Services on a timely basis, we may face risks that come from issues in full adoption of our certified Products and Services, which in turn could lead to a client missing its attestation targets. These risks are enhanced when we are under agreements to provide application management services to our clients that place responsibilities on us for application configuration and implementation as a prerequisite to attainment of quality measures ordinarily borne by the client.\nTable of Content\nThe ONC has finalized additional regulations under the Cures Act to enforce the Act's policy directives relating to data sharing and interoperability. The ONC is charged under the Cures Act with developing a Trusted Exchange Framework that establishes governance requirements for trusted health information exchange in the United States. In addition, the ONC certification criteria updated under the Cures Act require that Cerner enable its clients to capture, store and exchange the types of health information defined within the ONC developed U.S. Common Data Set for Interoperability (USCDI) which represents the essential health information data for the U.S. healthcare system. The USCDI is designed to be maintained on an iterative basis to account for new requirements and priorities for health information that may emerge such through the COVID-19 pandemic. ONC continues to modify and refine these standards. We may incur increased software development and administrative expense and delays in delivering Products and Services if we need to update our Products and Services to conform to these varying and evolving requirements and standards. In addition, delays in interpreting these standards may result in postponement or cancellation of our clients' decisions to purchase our Products and Services. If our Products and Services are not compliant with these evolving standards, our market position and sales could be impaired, we may have to invest significantly in changes to our Products and Services, we may be subject to contractual liability and our reputation could be damaged. If our Products and Services are not consistent with those requirements, we could be forced to incur substantial additional development costs to conform.\nOur work with government clients exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government contracting environment. Our clients include national, provincial, state, local and foreign governmental entities and their agencies. Our government work carries various risks inherent in contracting with government entities. These risks include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022Government entities, particularly in the United States, often reserve the right to audit our contracts and conduct reviews, inquiries and investigations of our business practices and performance with respect to government contracts. If a government client discovers improper conduct during its audits or investigations, we may become subject to various civil and criminal penalties, including those under the civil U.S. False Claims Act, and administrative sanctions, which may include termination of contracts, suspension of payments, fines and civil money penalties, and suspensions or debarment from doing business with other government agencies.\n\u2022U.S. government contracting regulations impose strict compliance and disclosure obligations and our failure to comply with these obligations could be a basis for suspension or debarment, or both, from federal government contracting in addition to breach of the specific contract.\n\u2022Government contracts are subject to heightened reputational and contractual risks compared to contracts with commercial clients and often involve more extensive scrutiny and publicity. Negative publicity, including allegations of improper or illegal activity, poor contract performance, or information security breaches, regardless of accuracy, may adversely affect our reputation.\n\u2022Terms and conditions of government contracts also tend to be more onerous, are often more difficult to negotiate and involve additional costs. We must comply with specific procurement regulations and a variety of other socio-economic requirements, as well as various statutes, regulations and requirements related to employment practices, recordkeeping and accounting. Our failure to comply with a variety of complex procurement rules and regulations could result in our liability for penalties, including termination of our government contracts, disqualification from bidding on future government contracts and suspension or debarment from government contracting.\n\u2022Government entities typically fund projects through appropriated monies. Our VA Electronic Health Record Modernization and DOD MHS Genesis agreements are indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contracts. The change in presidential administration may affect VA and DOD budget priorities for this ongoing work.\n\u2022Government entities reserve the right to change the scope of or terminate these projects at their convenience for lack of approved funding or other reasons, which could limit our recovery of reimbursable expenses or investments. In addition, government contracts may be protested, which could result in administrative procedures and litigation, result in delays in performance and payment, be expensive to defend and be incapable of prompt resolution.\n\u2022It is common in contracting with governments for there to be a prime contractor with privity of contract to the government client and one or more subcontractors. We serve in both capacities for different government clients. There are inherent risks in being a subcontractor, including without limitation, reliance on the performance of the prime contractor for the execution of the contract to the satisfaction of the client. Additionally, when we serve as the prime contractor, we rely on our subcontractors to fulfill certain contractual obligations under our agreements with government clients. A failure by the prime contractor to perform under an agreement under which we serve as a subcontractor, or a failure by a subcontractor to perform under an agreement under which we serve as a prime contractor, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nTable of Content\nThe occurrences or conditions described above could affect not only our business with the particular government entities involved, but also our business with other entities of the same or other governmental bodies or with certain commercial clients and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nCapital and Credit Risks\nVolatility and disruption resulting from global economic or market conditions could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our business, results of operations, financial condition and outlook may be impacted by the health of the global economy. Our business and financial performance, including new business bookings and collection of our accounts receivable, may be adversely affected by current and future economic conditions that cause a slowdown or decline in client spending. Reduced purchases by our clients or changes in payment terms could adversely affect our revenue growth and cause a decrease in our cash flow from operations. Bankruptcies or similar events affecting clients may cause us to incur bad debt expense at levels higher than historically experienced. Further, volatility and disruption in global financial markets may also limit our ability to access the capital markets at a time when we would like, or need, to raise capital, which could have an impact on our ability to react to changing economic and business conditions. Accordingly, if global financial and economic volatility continues or worsens, particularly in light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic or the resurgence thereof, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nThere are risks associated with our outstanding and future indebtedness. As of December 31, 2021, we had $1.84 billion of total outstanding indebtedness, and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future. We have customary restrictive covenants in our current debt agreements, which may limit our flexibility to operate our business. These covenants include limitations on priority debt, liens, mergers, asset dispositions, and transactions with affiliates, and require us to maintain certain leverage and interest coverage ratios. Failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, our ability to pay interest and repay the principal for our indebtedness is dependent upon our ability to manage our business operations, generate sufficient cash flows to service such debt and the other factors discussed in this section. There can be no assurance that we will be able to manage any of these risks successfully.\nOur Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as amended, the \"Credit Agreement\") bears interest at variable interest rates, primarily based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\"). LIBOR is currently in the process of being phased out. The Credit Agreement includes provisions intended to provide for the replacement of LIBOR with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\") or another widely-accepted alternative benchmark rate upon the cessation of LIBOR or the occurrence of other triggering events, with corresponding adjustments to the applicable interest rate margins. However, uncertainty as to the timing and nature of such modifications could cause the interest rate calculated for the Credit Agreement to be materially different than expected, and there is no guarantee that a transition from LIBOR to an alternative will not result in financial market disruptions, significant increases in benchmark rates, or borrowing costs to borrowers, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. With respect to our Credit Agreement and the related interest rate swap, if the swap and the Credit Agreement replacement rates are not identical, our hedge could be less effective. Our failure to manage these risks effectively could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe cannot guarantee that our capital allocation strategy, which may include share repurchases and dividend payments, will be fully implemented or that it will enhance long-term shareholder value. As of December 31, 2021, $3.18 billion remains available for repurchase under our stock repurchase program, which expires on December 31, 2023. We are not obligated to repurchase a specified number or dollar value of shares and do not plan to repurchase shares in the near term. Additionally, while we expect to pay a cash dividend on a quarterly basis, future declarations of such dividends are subject to approval by the Board of Directors. Either or both of our repurchase or dividend programs may be suspended or terminated at any time and, even if fully implemented, may not enhance long-term shareholder value.\nTax, Finance and Accounting Related Risks\nWe are subject to tax legislation in numerous countries; changes in tax laws or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We are a global corporation with a presence primarily in North America, Europe, the Middle East, Australia, and India. As such, we are subject to tax laws, regulations and policies of the U.S. federal, state and local governments and comparable taxing authorities in other\nTable of Content\ncountry jurisdictions. Changes in tax laws could cause us to experience fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rates in future periods and otherwise adversely affect our tax positions and our tax liabilities. Our effective tax rates, tax payments, tax credits or incentives could be adversely affected by changes in tax laws. In addition, U.S. federal, state and local, as well as other countries' tax laws and regulations, are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations and require significant judgment in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. As these and other tax laws and related regulations change, our financial results could be materially impacted. In the ordinary course of a global business, there are many intercompany transactions and calculations which could be subject to challenge by tax authorities. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities and those authorities often do not agree with positions taken by us on our tax returns. Our intercompany transfer pricing has been reviewed by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") and by foreign tax jurisdictions and will likely be subject to additional audits in the future. There can be no assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge, which could result in additional taxation, penalties and interest payments.\nOur strategy to transition to a subscription based recurring revenue model and continued modernization of our technology may adversely affect our near-term revenue growth and results of operations. As we transition more of our offerings to leverage cloud technologies, we may incur disruption as we transition existing clients and be less competitive during the transition, which could impact revenue and profitability. We believe we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position; and oftentimes, successful investments require several years before generating significant revenue. We expect our ongoing shift from a software license model to a subscription-based services revenue model to create a recurring revenue stream that is more predictable. The transition, however, creates changes related to the timing of revenue recognition compared to historical patterns. We also incur certain expenses associated with the infrastructures of our cloud-based offerings in advance of our ability to recognize the revenues associated with these offerings, which may adversely affect our near-term reported revenues, results of operations and cash flows. A decline in renewals of recurring revenue offerings in any period may not be immediately reflected in our results for that period but may result in a decline in our revenue and results of operations in future quarters.\nGoodwill and other intangible assets represent approximately 21% of our total assets and we could suffer losses due to asset impairment charges. We assess our goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment periodically in accordance with applicable authoritative accounting guidance. Declines in business performance or other factors could result in a non-cash impairment charge. This could materially and negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur sales forecasts may vary from actual sales in a particular quarter. We use a \"pipeline\" system, a common industry practice, to forecast sales and trends in our business. Our sales associates monitor the status of all sales opportunities, such as the date when they estimate that a client will make a purchase decision and the potential dollar amount of the sale. These estimates are aggregated periodically to generate a sales pipeline. We compare this pipeline at various points in time to evaluate trends in our business. This analysis provides guidance in business planning and forecasting, but these pipeline estimates are by their nature speculative. Our pipeline estimates are not necessarily reliable predictors of revenues in a particular quarter or over a longer period of time, partially because of changes in the pipeline and in conversion rates of the pipeline into contracts that can be very difficult to estimate. A negative variation in the expected conversion rate or timing of the pipeline into contracts, or in the pipeline itself, could cause our plan or forecast to be inaccurate and thereby adversely affect business results.\nLower than expected revenue growth or shifts in our revenue mix could adversely affect our results of operations. Our revenue growth and mix could vary over time due to a number of factors, including timing of contracts signing, changes in the health of our end markets, unexpected client attrition, and the mix of software, hardware, devices, maintenance, support and services revenues, which carry different margin rates which can vary from period to period. Our operating results could be harmed by changes in revenue mix and costs, together with numerous other factors, including rapid growth in lower margin services business, declines in software, and growth in non-cash expenses, such as amortization and depreciation.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nOur quarterly operating results may vary, which could adversely affect our stock price. Our quarterly operating results have varied in the past and may continue to vary in future periods, including variations from guidance, expectations or historical results or trends. Quarterly operating results may vary for a number of reasons including demand for our Products and Services, the financial condition of our current and potential clients, our long sales cycle, potentially long\nTable of Content\ninstallation and implementation cycles for larger, more complex systems, accounting policy changes, our clients' abilities to meet project milestones, seasonality of revenue collection and other factors described in this section and elsewhere in this report. As a result of healthcare industry trends and the market for our Products and Services, a large percentage of our revenues are generated by the sale and installation of larger, more complex and higher-priced systems. The sales process for these systems is lengthy and involves a significant technical evaluation and commitment of capital and other resources by the client. Sales may be subject to delays due to changes in clients' internal budgets, procedures for approving large capital expenditures, competing needs for other capital expenditures, additions or amendments to applicable laws, availability of personnel resources or by actions taken by competitors. Revenue recognized in any quarter may also depend upon our clients' abilities to meet project milestones. Delays in the expected sale, installation or implementation of these large systems or in meeting project milestones may have a significant negative impact on our anticipated quarterly revenues and consequently our earnings, since a significant percentage of our expenses are relatively fixed. Because of the complexity and value of our contracts, the loss of even a small number of clients could have a significant negative effect on our financial results. We may also experience seasonality in revenues.\nThe trading price of our common stock may be volatile. The market for our common stock may experience significant price and volume fluctuations in response to a number of factors including actual or anticipated variations in operating results, articles or rumors about our performance or Products and Services, announcements of technological innovations or new services or products by our competitors or us, changes in expectations of future financial performance or estimates of securities analysts, governmental regulatory action, healthcare reform measures, client relationship developments, economic conditions, our pending acquisition by Oracle and its affiliates, and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Furthermore, broad market and industry fluctuations may also adversely affect the trading price of our common stock, regardless of actual operating performance. As a matter of policy, we do not generally comment on our stock price or rumors.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could materially affect our financial results. Our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars. In general, the functional currency of our subsidiaries is the local currency where the subsidiary operates. For each subsidiary, assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet dates and revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates prevailing during the month of the transaction. Therefore, future fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against major currencies, could materially affect our financial results.", "PERMNO": 10909, "SIC": 7373, "TIC": "CERN"}
