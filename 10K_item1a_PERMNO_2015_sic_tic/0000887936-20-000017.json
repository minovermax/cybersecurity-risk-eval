RISK FACTORS\nAll of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition to the risks discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report, other risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial could, in the future, materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nRisks Related to Our Reportable Segments\nChanges in capital markets, M&A activity, legal or regulatory requirements, general economic conditions and monetary or geopolitical disruptions, as well as other factors beyond our control, could reduce demand for our practice offerings or services, in which case our revenues and profitability could decline.\nDifferent factors outside of our control could affect demand for a segment\u2019s practices and our services. These include:\n\u2022\nfluctuations in U.S. and/or global economies, including economic downturns or recessions and the strength and rate of any general economic recoveries;\n\u2022\nthe U.S. or global financial markets and the availability, costs, and terms of credit and credit modifications;\n\u2022\nlevel of leverage incurred by countries or businesses;\n\u2022\nM&A activity;\n\u2022\nfrequency and complexity of significant commercial litigation;\n\u2022\noverexpansion by businesses causing financial difficulties;\n\u2022\nbusiness and management crises, including the occurrence of alleged fraudulent or illegal activities and practices;\n\u2022\nnew and complex laws and regulations, repeals of existing laws and regulations or changes of enforcement of laws, rules and regulations, including antitrust/competition reviews of proposed M&A transactions;\n\u2022\nother economic, geographic or political factors; and\n\u2022\ngeneral business conditions.\nWe are not able to predict the positive or negative effects that future events or changes to the U.S. or global economies will have on our business or the business of any particular segment. Fluctuations, changes and disruptions in financial, credit, M&A and other markets, political instability and general business factors could impact various segments\u2019 operations and could affect such operations differently. Changes to factors described above, as well as other events, including by way of example, contractions of regional economies, or the economy of a particular country, trade restrictions, monetary systems, banking, real estate and retail or other industries; debt or credit difficulties or defaults by businesses or countries; new, repeals of or changes to laws and regulations, including changes to the bankruptcy and competition laws of the U.S. or other countries; tort reform; banking reform; a decline in the implementation or adoption of new laws or regulation, or in government enforcement, litigation or monetary damages or remedies that are sought; or political instability may have adverse effects on one or more of our segments or service, practice or industry offerings.\nOur revenues, operating income and cash flows are likely to fluctuate.\nWe experience fluctuations in our revenues and cost structure and the resulting operating income and cash flows and expect that this will continue to occur in the future. We experience fluctuations in our annual and quarterly financial results, including revenues, operating income and earnings per share, for reasons that include: (i) the types and complexity, number, size, timing and duration of client engagements; (ii) the timing of revenue recognition under U.S. GAAP; (iii) the utilization of revenue-generating professionals, including the ability to adjust staffing levels up or down to accommodate the business and prospects of the applicable segment and practice; (iv) the time it takes before a new hire becomes profitable; (v) the geographic locations of our clients or the locations where services are rendered; (vi) billing rates and fee arrangements, including the opportunity and ability to successfully reach milestones and complete, and collect success fees and other outcome-contingent or performance-based fees; (vii) the length of billing and collection cycles and changes in amounts that may become uncollectible; (viii) changes in the frequency and complexity of government regulatory and enforcement activities; (ix) business and asset acquisitions; (x) fluctuations in the exchange rates of various currencies against the U.S. dollar; and (xi) economic factors beyond our control.\nThe results of different segments and practices may be affected differently by the above factors. Certain of our practices, particularly our restructuring practice, tend to experience their highest demand during periods when market and/or industry conditions are less favorable for many businesses. For example, in periods of limited credit availability, reduced M&A activity and/or declining business and/or consumer spending, while not always the case, there may be increased restructuring opportunities that will cause our restructuring practice to experience high demand. On the other hand, those same factors may cause a number of our other segments and practices, such as our antitrust and competition practice in Economic Consulting, to experience reduced demand. The positive effects of certain events or factors on certain segments and practices may not be sufficient to overcome the negative effects of those same events or factors on other parts of our business. In addition, our mix of practice offerings adds complexity to the task of predicting revenues and results of operations and managing our staffing levels and expenditures across changing business cycles and economic environments.\nOur results are subject to seasonal and similar factors, such as during the fourth quarter when our professionals and our clients typically take vacations. We may also experience fluctuations in our operating income and related cash flows because of increases in employee compensation, including changes to our incentive compensation structure and the timing of incentive payments, which we generally pay during the first quarter of each year, or hiring or retention payments, which are paid throughout the year. Also, the timing of investments or acquisitions and the cost of integrating them may cause fluctuations in our financial results, including operating income and cash flows. This volatility makes it difficult to forecast our future results with precision and to assess accurately whether increases or decreases in any one or more quarters are likely to cause annual results to exceed or fall short of previously issued guidance. While we assess our annual guidance at the end of each quarter and update such guidance when we think it is appropriate, unanticipated future volatility can cause actual results to vary significantly from our guidance, even where that guidance reflects a range of possible results and has been updated to take account of partial-year results.\nIf we do not effectively manage the utilization of our professionals or billable rates, our financial results could decline.\nOur failure to manage the utilization of our professionals who bill on an hourly basis, or maintain or increase the hourly rates we charge our clients for our services, could result in adverse consequences, such as non- or lower-revenue-generating professionals, increased employee turnover, fixed compensation expenses in periods of declining revenues, the inability to appropriately staff engagements (including adding or reducing staff during periods of increased or decreased demand for our services), or special charges associated with reductions in staff or operations. Reductions in workforce or increases of billable rates will not necessarily lead to savings. In such events, our financial results may decline or be adversely impacted. A number of factors affect the utilization of our professionals. Some of these factors we cannot predict with certainty, including general economic and financial market conditions; the complexity, number, type, size and timing of client engagements; the level of demand for our services; appropriate professional staffing levels, in light of changing client demands and market conditions; utilization of professionals across segments and geographic regions; competition; and acquisitions. In addition, our global expansion into or within locations where we are not well-known or where demand for our services is not well-developed could also contribute to low or lower utilization rates in certain locations.\nSegments may enter into engagements such as fixed-fee and time and materials with caps. Failure to effectively manage professional hours and other aspects of alternative fee engagements may result in the costs of providing such services exceeding the fees collected by the Company. Failure to successfully complete or reach milestones with respect to contingent fee or success fee assignments may also lead to lower revenues or the costs of providing services under those types of arrangements may exceed the fees collected by the Company.\nFactors that could negatively affect utilization in our segments include:\nCorporate Finance & Restructuring - The completion of bankruptcy proceedings; the timing of the completion of other engagements; fewer and smaller restructuring (including bankruptcy) cases; a recovering or strong economy; easy credit availability; low interest rates; and fewer, smaller and less complex M&A and restructuring activity; or less capital markets activity.\nForensic and Litigation Consulting - The settlement of litigation; less frequent instances of significant mismanagement, fraud, wrongdoing or other business problems that could result in fewer or less complex business engagements; fewer and less complex legal disputes; fewer class action suits; the timing of the completion of engagements; less government regulation or fewer regulatory investigations; and the timing of government investigations and litigation.\nEconomic Consulting - Fewer, smaller and less complex M&A activity; less capital markets activity or fewer complex transactions; a reduced number of regulatory filings and less litigation, reduced or less aggressive antitrust and competition\nregulation or enforcement; fewer government investigations and proceedings; and the timing of client utilization of our services.\nTechnology - The settlement of litigation; a decline in volume and complexity of litigation proceedings and governmental investigations; and volume and timing of M&A activities and degree of enforcement of antitrust regulations.\nStrategic Communications - Fewer event-driven crises affecting businesses; general economic decline that may reduce certain discretionary spending by clients; a decline in capital markets activity, including M&A; and fewer public securities offerings.\nOur segments may face risks of fee non-payment, clients may seek to renegotiate existing fees and contract arrangements, and clients may not accept billable rate or price increases, which could result in loss of clients, fee write-offs, reduced revenues and less profitable business.\nIn some cases, our segments are engaged by certain clients who are experiencing or anticipate experiencing financial distress or are facing complex challenges, are engaged in litigation or regulatory or judicial proceedings, or are facing foreclosure of collateral or liquidation of assets. This may be true in light of general economic conditions; lingering effects of past economic slowdowns or recession; or business- or operations-specific reasons. Such clients may not have sufficient funds to continue operations or to pay for our services. We typically do not receive retainers before we begin performing services on a client\u2019s behalf in connection with a significant number of engagements in our segments. In the cases where we have received retainers, we cannot assure the retainers will adequately cover our fees for the services we perform on behalf of these clients. With respect to bankruptcy cases, bankruptcy courts have the discretion to require us to return all, or a portion of, our fees.\nWe may receive requests to discount our fees or to negotiate lower rates for our services and to agree to contract terms relative to the scope of services and other terms that may limit the size of an engagement or our ability to pass through costs. We consider these requests on a case-by-case basis. We routinely receive these types of requests and expect this to continue in the future. In addition, our clients and prospective clients may not accept rate increases that we put into effect or plan to implement in the future. Fee discounts, pressure not to increase or even decrease our rates, and less advantageous contract terms could result in the loss of clients, lower revenues and operating income, higher costs and less profitable engagements. More discounts or write-offs than we expect in any period would have a negative impact on our results of operations. There is no assurance that significant client engagements will be renewed or replaced in a timely manner or at all, or that they will generate the same volume of work or revenues or be as profitable as past engagements.\nCertain of our clients prefer fixed and other alternative fee arrangements that place revenue ceilings or other limitations on our fee structure or may shift more of our revenue-generating potential to back-end contingent and success fee arrangements. With respect to such alternative fee arrangements, we may discount our rates initially, which could mean that the cost of providing services exceeds the fees collected by the Company during all or a portion of the term of the engagement. In such cases, the Company\u2019s failure to manage the engagement efficiently or collect the success or performance fees could expose the Company to a greater risk of loss on such engagement than other fee arrangements or may cause variations in the Company\u2019s revenues and operating results due to the timing of achievement of the performance-based criteria, if achieved at all. A segment\u2019s ability to service clients with these fee arrangements at a cost that does not directly correlate to time and materials may negatively impact or result in a loss of the profitability of such engagements, adversely affecting the financial results of the segment.\nOur Technology segment faces certain risks, including (i) industry consolidation and a highly competitive environment, (ii) client concentration, (iii) downward pricing pressure, (iv) technology changes and obsolescence and (v) failure to protect IP used by the segment, which individually or together could cause the financial results and prospects of this segment and the Company to decline.\nOur Technology segment is facing significant competition from other consulting and/or software providers specializing in e-discovery, ESI and the management of electronic content. There continues to be consolidation of companies providing products and services similar to those offered by our Technology segment, which may provide competitors access to greater financial and other resources than those of the Company. Larger competitors may be able to react more quickly to new regulatory or legal requirements and other changes, or innovate more quickly and efficiently. Our Technology segment has been experiencing increasing competition from companies providing similar services at lower prices, particularly with respect to hosting and e-discovery services.\nThe success of our Technology segment and its ability to compete depends significantly on the IP rights we license from third-parties. There is no assurance that (i) the software we license to provide our services will remain competitive or\ntechnologically innovative, (ii) new, innovative or improved software or products will not be developed by others that will compete more effectively with the software or products we currently license or use to service our customers, or (iii) we can enter into licenses or other agreements on economically advantageous terms to license or enter into other agreements to use new or more innovative third-party software and products to provide our services. If our Technology segment is unable to license or otherwise use competitively innovative or technologically advanced software and products to provide our services, we could be unable to retain clients, grow our business and capitalize on market opportunities, which would adversely affect our operating margins and financial results.\nUnauthorized use and misuse of our proprietary IP by employees or third parties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The available legal remedies for unauthorized or misuse of our proprietary IP may not adequately compensate us for the damages caused by unauthorized use.\nOur segments face certain risks relating to cybersecurity and the failure to protect the confidentiality of client information against misuse or disclosure.\nOur reputation for maintaining the confidentiality of proprietary, confidential and trade secret information is critical to the success of our segments. In addition, our Technology segment is dependent on providing secure information storage to host client information as a service. We routinely face cyber-based attacks and attempts by hackers and similar unauthorized users to gain access to or corrupt our information technology systems, which so far, to our knowledge, have been unsuccessful. Such attacks could disrupt our business operations, cause us to incur unanticipated losses or expenses, and result in unauthorized disclosures of confidential or proprietary information. We expect to continue to face such attempts. Although we seek to prevent, detect and investigate these network security incidents, and take steps to mitigate the likelihood of network security breaches, there can be no assurance that attacks by unauthorized users will not be attempted in the future or that our security measures will be effective. If we fail to effectively protect the confidentiality of our clients\u2019 or our own IP and proprietary information from disclosure or misuse by our employees, contractors or third parties, the financial results of the affected segment or the Company would be adversely affected. There is no certainty that we can maintain the confidentiality or prevent the misuse of our or our client information.\nWe may not manage our growth effectively, and our profitability may suffer.\nWe experience fluctuations in growth of our different segments, practices or services, including periods of rapid or declining growth. Periods of rapid expansion may strain our management team or human resources and information systems. To manage growth successfully, we may need to add qualified managers and employees and periodically update our operating, financial and other systems, as well as our internal procedures and controls. We also must effectively motivate, train and manage a larger professional staff. If we fail to add or retain qualified managers, employees and contractors when needed, estimate costs, or manage our growth effectively, our business, financial results and financial condition may suffer.\nWe cannot assure that we can successfully manage growth through acquisitions and the integration of the companies and assets we acquire or that they will result in the financial, operational and other benefits that we anticipate. Some acquisitions may not be immediately accretive to earnings, and some expansion may result in significant expenditures.\nIn periods of declining growth, underutilized employees and contractors may result in expenses and costs being a greater percentage of revenues. In such situations, we will have to weigh the benefits of decreasing our workforce or limiting our service offerings and saving costs against the detriment that the Company could experience from losing valued professionals and their industry expertise and clients.\nRisks Related to Our Operations\nOur international operations involve special risks.\nOur international operations involve financial and business risks that differ from or are in addition to those faced by our U.S. operations, including:\n\u2022\ncultural and language differences;\n\u2022\nlimited \u201cbrand\u201d recognition;\n\u2022\ndifferent employment laws and rules, employment or service contracts, compensation methods, and social and cultural factors that could result in employee turnover, lower utilization rates, higher costs and cyclical fluctuations in utilization that could adversely affect financial and operating results;\n\u2022\nforeign currency disruptions and currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies that could adversely affect financial and operating results;\n\u2022\ndifferent legal and regulatory requirements and other barriers to conducting business;\n\u2022\ngreater difficulties in resolving the collection of receivables when legal proceedings are necessary;\n\u2022\ngreater difficulties in managing our non-U.S. operations, including client relationships, in certain locations;\n\u2022\ndisparate systems, policies, procedures and processes;\n\u2022\nfailure to comply with the FCPA and anti-bribery laws of other jurisdictions;\n\u2022\nhigher operating costs;\n\u2022\nlonger sales and/or collections cycles;\n\u2022\npotential restrictions or adverse tax consequences for the repatriation of foreign earnings, such as trapped foreign losses and importation or withholding taxes;\n\u2022\ndifferent or less stable political and/or economic environments;\n\u2022\npotential increased regulatory and legal complexities surrounding uncertainties related to the UK\u2019s exit from the European Union, commonly referred to as Brexit;\n\u2022\nconflicts between and among the U.S. and countries in which we conduct business, including those arising from trade disputes or disruptions, the termination or suspension of treaties, or boycotts;\n\u2022\ncivil disturbances or other catastrophic events that reduce business activity; and\n\u2022\npolitical interference with our ability to conduct business in the applicable jurisdiction.\nIf we are not able to quickly adapt to or effectively manage our operations in geographic markets outside the U.S., our business prospects and results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nFailure to comply with governmental, regulatory and legal requirements or with our company-wide Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, Anti-Corruption Policy, Policy on Inside Information and Insider Trading, and other policies could lead to governmental or legal proceedings that could expose us to significant liabilities and damage our reputation.\nWe have a robust Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, Anti-Corruption Policy, Policy on Inside Information and Insider Trading, and other policies and procedures that are designed to educate and establish the standards of conduct that we expect from our executive officers, outside directors, employees, and independent consultants and contractors. These policies require strict compliance with U.S. and local laws and regulations applicable to our business operations, including those laws and regulations prohibiting improper payments to government officials. In addition, as a corporation whose securities are registered under the Securities Act and publicly traded on the NYSE, our executive officers, outside directors, employees and independent contractors are required to comply with the prohibitions against insider trading of our securities. In addition, we impose certain restrictions on the trading of securities of our clients. Nonetheless, we cannot assure our stakeholders that our policies, procedures and related training programs will ensure full compliance with all applicable legal requirements. Illegal or improper conduct by our executive officers, directors, employees, independent consultants or contractors, or others who are subject to our policies and procedures could damage our reputation in the U.S. and internationally or lead to litigation or governmental or regulatory proceedings in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions, which could result in civil or criminal penalties, including substantial monetary awards, fines and penalties, as well as disgorgement of profits.\nWe may be required to recognize goodwill impairment charges, which could materially affect our financial results.\nWe assess our goodwill, trademarks and other intangible assets, as well as our other long-lived assets as and when required by GAAP to determine whether they are impaired and, if they are, to record appropriate impairment charges. Factors we consider include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results and significant negative industry or economic trends. We have previously recorded impairment charges to the carrying value of goodwill of certain of our segments, and it is possible that we may be required to record significant impairment charges in the future. Such charges have had and could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our People\nOur failure to recruit and retain qualified professionals could negatively affect our financial results and our ability to staff client engagements, maintain relationships with clients and drive future growth.\nWe deliver sophisticated professional services to our clients. Our success is dependent, in large part, on our ability to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand around the world. To attract and retain clients, we need to demonstrate professional acumen and build trust and strong relationships. Our professionals have highly specialized skills. They also develop strong bonds with the clients they serve. Our continued success depends upon our ability to attract and retain professionals who have expertise, a good reputation and client relationships critical to maintaining and developing our business. We face intense competition in recruiting and retaining highly qualified professionals to drive our organic growth and support expansion of our services and geographic footprint. We cannot assure that we will be able to attract or retain qualified professionals to maintain or expand our business. If we are unable to successfully integrate, motivate and retain qualified professionals, our ability to continue to secure work may suffer. Moreover, competition has caused our costs of retaining and hiring qualified professionals to increase, a trend that could continue and could adversely affect our operating margins and financial results.\nDespite fixed terms or renewal provisions, we could face retention issues during and at the end of the terms of those agreements and large compensation expenses to secure extensions. There is no assurance we will enter into new or extend employment agreements with our professionals. We monitor contract expirations carefully to commence dialogues with professionals regarding their employment in advance of the actual contract expiration dates. Our goal is to renew employment agreements when advisable and to stagger the expirations of the agreements if possible. Because of the concentration of contract expirations in certain years, we may experience high turnover or other adverse consequences, such as higher costs, loss of clients and engagements or difficulty in staffing engagements, if we are unable to renegotiate employment arrangements or the costs of retaining qualified professionals become too high. The implementation of new compensation arrangements may result in the concentration of potential turnover in future years.\nHeadcount reductions to manage costs during periods of reduced demand for our services could have negative impacts on our business over the longer term.\nOur people are our primary assets and account for the majority of our expenses. During periods of reduced demand for our services, or in response to unfavorable changes in market or industry conditions, we may seek to align our cost structure more closely with our revenues and increase our utilization rates by reducing headcount and eliminating or consolidating underused locations in affected business segments or practices. Following such actions, in response to subsequent increases in demand for our services, including as a result of favorable changes in market or industry conditions, we may need to hire, train and integrate additional qualified and skilled personnel and may be unable to do so to meet our needs or our clients\u2019 demands on a timely basis. If we are unable to manage staffing levels on a timely basis in light of changing opportunities or conditions, our ability to accept or service business opportunities and client engagements, take advantage of positive market and industry developments, and realize future growth could be negatively affected, which could negatively impact our revenues and profitability. In addition, while increased utilization resulting from headcount reductions may enhance our profitability in the near term, it could negatively affect our business over the longer term by limiting the time our professionals have to seek out and cultivate new client relationships and win new projects.\nWe incur substantial costs to hire and retain our professionals, and we expect these costs to continue and to grow.\nWe may pay hiring or retention bonuses to secure the services of professionals. Those payments have taken the form of unsecured general recourse forgivable loans, stock options, restricted stock, cash-based stock appreciation rights and other equity- and cash-based awards, and cash payments to attract and retain our professional employees. We make forgivable loans to KSIP participants and may provide forgivable or other types of loans to new hires and professionals who join us in connection with acquisitions, as well as to select current employees and other professionals on a case-by-case basis. The aggregate amount of loans to professionals is significant. We expect to continue issuing unsecured general recourse forgivable loans.\nWe also provide significant additional payments under the KSIP and annual recurring equity or cash awards under the ICP, the Executive Committee incentive compensation arrangements and other compensation programs, including awards in the form of restricted stock and other stock- or cash-based awards or, alternatively, cash if we do not have adequate equity securities available under stockholder-approved equity plans.\nIn addition, our Economic Consulting segment has contracts with select economists or professionals that provide for compensation equal to a percentage of such individual\u2019s annual collected client fees plus a percentage of the annual fees\ngenerated by junior professionals working on engagements managed by such professionals, which results in compensation expenses for that segment being a higher percentage of revenues and EBITDA than the compensation paid by other segments. We expect that these arrangements will continue and that the Company may enter into similar arrangements with other economists and professionals hired by the Company.\nWe rely heavily on our executive officers and the heads of our operating segments and industry leaders for the success of our business.\nWe rely heavily on our executive officers and the heads of our operating segments, regional locations and industries to manage our operations. Given the highly specialized nature of our services and the scale of our operations, our executive officers and the heads of our operating segments and industry and regional leaders must have a thorough understanding of our service offerings, as well as the skills and experience necessary to manage a large organization in diverse geographic locations. We are unable to predict with certainty the impact that leadership transitions may have on our business operations, prospects, financial results, client relationships, or employee retention or morale.\nProfessionals may leave our Company to form or join competitors, and we may not have, or may choose not to pursue, legal recourse against such professionals.\nOur professionals typically have close relationships with the clients they serve, based on their expertise and bonds of personal trust and confidence. Therefore, the barriers to our professionals pursuing independent business opportunities or joining our competitors should be considered low. Although our clients generally contract for services with us as a company, and not with an individual professional, in the event that a professional leaves, such clients may decide that they prefer to continue working with a specific professional rather than with our Company. Substantially all of our written employment arrangements with our Senior Managing Directors and equivalent employees include non-competition and non-solicitation covenants. These restrictions have generally been drafted to comply with state \u201creasonableness\u201d standards. However, states generally interpret restrictions on competition narrowly and in favor of employees. Therefore, a state may hold certain restrictions on competition to be unenforceable. In the case of employees outside the U.S., we draft non-competition provisions in an effort to comply with applicable foreign law. In the event an employee departs and acts in a way that we believe violates his or her non-competition or non-solicitation agreement, we will consider any legal remedies we may have against such person on a case-by-case basis. We may decide that preserving cooperation and a professional relationship with a former employee or client, or other concerns, outweighs the benefits of any possible legal recourse. We may also decide that the likelihood of success does not justify the costs of pursuing a legal remedy. Therefore, there may be times we may decide not to pursue legal action, even if it is available to us.\nRisks Related to Our Client Relationships\nIf we are unable to accept client engagements due to real or perceived relationship issues, our revenues, growth, client engagements and prospects may be negatively affected.\nOur inability to accept engagements from existing or prospective clients, represent multiple clients in connection with the same or competitive engagements, or any requirement that we resign from a client engagement may negatively impact our revenues, growth and financial results. While we follow internal practices to assess real and potential issues in the relationships between and among our clients, engagements, segments, practices and professionals, such concerns cannot always be avoided. For example, we generally will not represent parties adverse to each other in the same matter. Under U.S. federal bankruptcy rules, we generally may not represent both a debtor and its creditors in the same proceeding, and we are required to notify the U.S. Trustee of real or potential conflicts. Even if we begin a bankruptcy-related engagement, the U.S. Trustee could find that we no longer meet the disinterestedness standard because of real or potential changes in our status as a disinterested party and order us to resign, which could result in disgorgement of fees. Acquisitions may require us to resign from a client engagement because of relationship issues that are not currently identifiable. In addition, businesses that we acquire or employees who join us may not be free to accept engagements they could have accepted prior to our acquisition or hire because of relationship issues.\nClaims involving our services could harm our overall professional reputation and our ability to compete and attract business or hire or retain qualified professionals.\nOur engagements involve matters that may result in a severe impact on a client\u2019s business, cause the client a substantial monetary loss or prevent the client from pursuing business opportunities. Our ability to attract new clients and generate new and repeat engagements or hire professionals depends upon our ability to maintain a high degree of client satisfaction, as well as our reputation among industry professionals. As a result, any claims against us involving the quality of our services may be more damaging than similar claims against businesses in other industries.\nWe may incur significant costs and may lose engagements as a result of claims by our clients regarding our services.\nMany of our engagements involve complex analysis and the exercise of professional judgment, including litigation and governmental investigatory matters where we act as experts. Therefore, we are subject to the risk of professional and other liabilities. Although we believe we maintain an appropriate amount of insurance, it is limited. Damages and/or expenses resulting from any successful claim against us, for indemnity or otherwise, in excess of the amount of insurance coverage will be borne directly by us and could harm our profitability and financial resources. Any claim by a client or third party against us could expose us to reputational issues that adversely affect our ability to attract new or maintain existing engagements or clients or qualified professionals or other employees, consultants or contractors.\nOur clients may terminate our engagements with little or no notice and without penalty, which may result in unexpected declines in our utilization and revenues.\nOur engagements center on transactions, disputes, litigation and other event-driven occurrences that require independent analysis or expert services. Transactions may be postponed or canceled, litigation may be settled or dismissed, and disputes may be resolved, in each case with little or no prior notice to us. If we cannot manage our work in process, our professionals may be underutilized until we can reassign them or obtain new engagements, which can adversely affect financial results.\nThe engagement letters that we typically enter into with clients do not obligate them to continue to use our services. Typically, our engagement letters permit clients to terminate our services at any time without penalties. In addition, our business involves large client engagements that we staff with a substantial number of professionals. At any time, one or more client engagements may represent a significant portion of a segment\u2019s revenues. If we are unable to replace clients or revenues as engagements end or if clients unexpectedly cancel engagements with us or curtail the scope of our engagements and we are unable to replace the revenues from those engagements, eliminate the costs associated with those engagements or find other engagements to utilize our professionals, the financial results of the Company could be adversely affected.\nWe may not have, or may choose not to pursue, legal remedies against clients that terminate their engagements.\nThe engagement letters that we typically have with clients do not obligate them to continue to use our services and permit them to terminate the engagement without penalty at any time. Even if the termination of an ongoing engagement by a client could constitute a breach of the client\u2019s engagement agreement, we may decide that preserving the overall client relationship is more important than seeking damages for the breach and, for that or other reasons, decide not to pursue any legal remedies against a client, even though such remedies may be available to us. We make the determination whether to pursue any legal actions against a client on a case-by-case basis.\nFailures of our internal information technology systems controls.\nOur reputation for providing secure information storage and maintaining the confidentiality of proprietary, confidential and trade secret information is critical to the success of our businesses, especially our Technology segment, which hosts client information as a service. We routinely face cyber-based attacks and attempts by hackers and similar unauthorized users to gain access to or corrupt our information technology systems, which so far, to our knowledge, have been unsuccessful. Such attacks could disrupt our business operations, cause us to incur unanticipated losses or expenses, and result in unauthorized disclosures of confidential or proprietary information. We expect to continue to face such attempts. Although we seek to prevent, detect and investigate these network security incidents and have taken steps to mitigate the likelihood of network security breaches, there can be no assurance that attacks by unauthorized users will not be attempted in the future or that our security measures will be effective.\nCompromise of confidential or proprietary information could damage our reputation, harm our businesses and adversely impact our financial results.\nThe Company\u2019s own confidential and proprietary information and that of our clients could be compromised, whether intentionally or unintentionally, by our employees, consultants or vendors. A compromise of the security of our information technology systems leading to theft or misuse of our own or our clients\u2019 proprietary or confidential information, or the public disclosure or use of such information by others, could result in losses, third-party claims against us and reputational harm, including the loss of clients. The theft or compromise of our or our clients\u2019 information could negatively impact our reputation, financial results and prospects. In addition, if our reputation is damaged due to a data security breach, our ability to attract new engagements and clients may be impaired or we may be subjected to damages or penalties, which could negatively impact our businesses, financial results or financial condition.\nGovernmental focus on data privacy and security could increase our costs of operations.\nIn reaction to publicized incidents in which electronically stored personal and other information has been lost, accessed or stolen, or transmitted by or to third parties without permission, U.S. and non-U.S. governmental authorities have proposed or adopted or are considering proposing or adopting data security and/or data privacy statutes or regulations. Continued governmental focus on data security and privacy may lead to additional legislative and regulatory action, which could increase the complexity of doing business in the U.S. or the applicable jurisdiction. The increased emphasis on information security and the requirements to comply with applicable U.S. and foreign data security and privacy laws and regulations may increase our costs of doing business and negatively impact our financial results.\nRisks Related to Competition\nIf we fail to compete effectively, we may miss new business opportunities or lose existing clients, and our revenues and profitability may decline.\nThe market for some of our consulting services is highly competitive. We do not compete against the same companies across all of our segments, practices, services, industries or geographic regions. Instead, we compete with different companies or businesses of companies depending on the particular nature of a proposed engagement and the types of requested service(s) and the location of the client or delivery of the service(s). Our operations are highly competitive.\nOur competitors include large organizations, such as the global accounting firms and the large management and financial consulting companies that offer a broad range of consulting services; investment banking firms; IT consulting and software companies, which offer niche services that are the same or similar to services or products offered by one or more of our segments; and small firms and independent contractors that focus on specialized services. Some of our competitors have significantly more financial resources, a larger national or international presence, larger professional staffs and greater brand recognition than we do. Some have lower overhead and other costs and can compete through lower cost-service offerings.\nSince our business depends in large part on professional relationships, our business has low barriers to entry for professionals electing to start their own firms or work independently. In addition, it is relatively easy for professionals to change employers.\nIf we cannot compete effectively or if the costs of competing, including the costs of hiring and retaining professionals, become too expensive, our revenue growth and financial results could be negatively affected and may differ materially from our expectations.\nWe may face competition from parties who sell us their businesses and from professionals who cease working for us.\nIn connection with our acquisitions, we generally obtain non-solicitation agreements from the professionals we hire, as well as non-competition agreements from senior managers and professionals. The agreements prohibit such individuals from competing with us during the term of their employment and for a fixed period afterwards and from seeking to solicit our employees or clients. In some cases, but not all, we may obtain non-competition or non-solicitation agreements from parties who sell us their businesses or assets. The duration of post-employment non-competition and non-solicitation agreements typically ranges from six to 12 months. Non-competition agreements with the sellers of businesses or assets that we acquire typically continue longer than 12 months. Certain activities may be carved out of, or otherwise may not be prohibited by, these arrangements. We cannot assure that one or more of the parties from whom we acquire a business or assets, or who do not join us or leave our employment, will not compete with us or solicit our employees or clients in the future. States and foreign jurisdictions may interpret restrictions on competition narrowly and in favor of employees or sellers. Therefore, certain restrictions on competition or solicitation may be unenforceable. In addition, we may not pursue legal remedies if we determine that preserving cooperation and a professional relationship with a former employee or his or her clients, or other concerns, outweighs the benefits of any possible legal recourse or the likelihood of success does not justify the costs of pursuing a legal remedy. Such persons, because they have worked for our Company or a business that we acquire, may be able to compete more effectively with us, or be more successful in soliciting our employees and clients, than unaffiliated third parties.\nRisks Related to Acquisitions\nWe will consider future strategic or opportunistic acquisitions. In those cases, some or all of the following risks could be applicable.\nWe may have difficulty integrating acquisitions or convincing clients to allow assignment of their engagements to us, which can reduce the benefits we receive from acquisitions.\nThe process of managing and integrating acquisitions into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require significant financial, operational and managerial resources that would otherwise be available for the operation, development and organic expansion of our existing operations. To the extent that we misjudge our ability to properly manage and integrate acquisitions, we may have difficulty achieving our operating, strategic and financial objectives.\nAcquisitions also may involve a number of special financial, business and operational risks, such as:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in integrating diverse corporate cultures and management styles;\n\u2022\ndisparate policies and practices;\n\u2022\nclient relationship issues;\n\u2022\ndecreased utilization during the integration process;\n\u2022\nloss of key existing or acquired personnel;\n\u2022\nincreased costs to improve or coordinate managerial, operational, financial and administrative systems;\n\u2022\ndilutive issuances of equity securities, including convertible debt securities, to finance acquisitions;\n\u2022\nthe assumption of legal liabilities;\n\u2022\nfuture earn-out payments or other price adjustments;\n\u2022\npotential future write-offs relating to the impairment of goodwill or other acquired intangible assets or the revaluation of assets;\n\u2022\ndifficulty or inability to collect receivables; and\n\u2022\nundisclosed liabilities.\nIn addition to the integration challenges mentioned above, our acquisitions of non-U.S. companies offer distinct integration challenges relating to foreign laws and governmental regulations, including tax and employee benefit laws, and other factors relating to operating in countries other than the U.S., which we have addressed above in the discussion regarding the difficulties we may face operating globally.\nAsset transactions may require us to seek client consents to the assignment of their engagements to us or a subsidiary. All clients may not consent to assignments. In certain cases, such as government contracts and bankruptcy engagements, the consent of clients cannot be solicited until after the acquisition has closed. Further, such engagements may be subject to security clearance requirements or bidding provisions with which we might not be able to comply. There is no assurance that clients of the acquired entity or local, state, federal or foreign governments will agree to novate or assign their contracts to us.\nThe Company may also hire groups of selected professionals from another company. In such event, there may be restrictions on the ability of the professionals who join the Company to compete and work on client engagements. In addition, the Company may enter into arrangements with the former employers of those professionals regarding limitations on their work until any time restrictions pass. In such circumstances, there is no assurance that the Company will enter into mutually agreeable arrangements with any former employer, and the utilization of such professionals may be limited, and our financial results could be negatively affected until their restrictions end. The Company could also face litigation risks from group hires.\nWe may be unable to take advantage of opportunistic acquisition situations, which may adversely affect our ability to expand or diversify our business.\nAt the time an acquisition opportunity presents itself, internal and external pressures (including, but not limited to, competition for such acquisition, the cost of such acquisition, borrowing capacity under our senior secured bank revolving\ncredit facility (as amended and restated on November 30, 2018, the \u201cCredit Facility\u201d) or the availability and cost of alternative financing) may cause us to be unable to pursue or complete an acquisition.\nAn acquisition may not be accretive in the near term or at all.\nCompetitive market conditions may require us to pay a price that represents a higher multiple of revenues or profits for an acquisition. As a result of these competitive dynamics, cost of the acquisition or other factors, certain acquisitions may not be accretive to our overall financial results at the time of the acquisition or at all.\nWe may have a different system of governance and management from a company we acquire or its parent, which could cause professionals who join us from an acquired company to leave us.\nOur governance and management policies and practices will not mirror the policies and practices of an acquired company or its parent. In some cases, different management practices and policies may lead to workplace dissatisfaction on the part of professionals who join our Company. Some professionals may choose not to join our Company or leave after joining us. Existing professionals may leave us as well. The loss of key professionals may harm our business and financial results and cause us not to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition.\nDue to fluctuations in our stock price, acquisition candidates may be reluctant to accept shares of our common stock as purchase price consideration, use of our shares as purchase price consideration may be dilutive or the owners of certain companies we seek to acquire may insist on stock price guarantees.\nWe may structure an acquisition to pay a portion of the purchase price in shares of our common stock. The number of shares issued as consideration is typically based on an average closing price per share of our common stock for a number of days prior to the closing of such acquisition. We believe that payment in the form of shares of common stock of FTI Consulting provides the acquired entity and its principals with a vested interest in the future success of the acquisition and the Company. Stock market volatility, generally, or FTI Consulting\u2019s stock price volatility, specifically, may result in acquisition candidates being reluctant to accept our shares as consideration. In such cases, we may have to issue more shares if stock constitutes part of the consideration, offer stock price guarantees, pay the entire purchase price in cash or negotiate an alternative price structure. The result may be an increase in the cost of an acquisition.\nCertain past acquisition-related agreements have contained stock price guarantees that resulted in cash payments in the future if the price per share of FTI Consulting common stock fell below a specified per share market value on the date restrictions lapse. There is no assurance that an acquisition candidate will not negotiate stock price guarantees with respect to a future acquisition, which may increase the cost of such acquisition.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nOur leverage could adversely affect our financial condition or operating flexibility if the Company fails to comply with operating covenants under applicable debt instruments.\nOur Credit Facility, or our other indebtedness outstanding from time to time, contains or may contain operating covenants that may, subject to exceptions, limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things:\n\u2022\ncreate, incur or assume certain liens;\n\u2022\nmake certain restricted payments, investments and loans;\n\u2022\ncreate, incur or assume additional indebtedness or guarantees;\n\u2022\ncreate restrictions on the payment of dividends or other distributions to us from our restricted subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nengage in M&A transactions, consolidations, sale-leasebacks, joint ventures, and asset and security sales and dispositions;\n\u2022\npay dividends or redeem or repurchase our capital stock;\n\u2022\nalter the business that we and our subsidiaries conduct;\n\u2022\nengage in certain transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nmodify the terms of certain indebtedness;\n\u2022\nprepay, redeem or purchase certain indebtedness; and\n\u2022\nmake material changes to accounting and reporting practices.\nIn addition, the Credit Facility includes a financial covenant that requires us not to exceed a maximum consolidated total net leverage ratio (the ratio of funded debt (less unrestricted cash up to $150.0 million) to Consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the Credit Facility).\nOperating results below a certain level or other adverse factors, including a significant increase in interest rates, could result in us being unable to comply with certain covenants. If we violate any applicable covenants and are unable to obtain waivers, our agreements governing our indebtedness or other applicable agreement could be declared in default and could be accelerated, which could permit, in the case of secured debt, the lenders to foreclose on our assets securing the debt thereunder. If the indebtedness is accelerated, we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it. Even if we are able to obtain new financing, it may not be on commercially reasonable terms or on terms that are acceptable to us. If our debt is in default for any reason, our cash flows, financial results or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, complying with these covenants may cause us to take actions that are not favorable to holders of our outstanding indebtedness and may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete against companies that are not subject to such restrictions.\nDespite our current level of indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries may still incur significant additional indebtedness, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness.\nOur current level of indebtedness could have important consequences on our future operations. We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness, including additional secured indebtedness, in the future. The terms of the indenture, dated as of August 20, 2018, between us and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the \"Indenture\") governing the 2.0% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 (the \u201c2023 Convertible Notes\u201d) do not restrict us from incurring additional debt, securing existing or future debt, recapitalizing our debt or taking a number of other actions that are not limited by the terms of the Indenture. The terms of the agreements governing our Credit Facility and other indebtedness limit, but do not prohibit, us from incurring additional indebtedness.\nOur ability to incur additional indebtedness may have the effect of reducing the funds available to pay amounts due with respect to our indebtedness. If we incur new indebtedness or other liabilities, the related risks that we and our subsidiaries may face could intensify.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness, and we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our payment obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance, including the performance of our subsidiaries, which will be affected by financial, business and economic conditions, competition and other factors. We will not be able to control many of these factors, such as the general economy, economic conditions in the industries in which we operate and competitive pressures. Our cash flow may not be sufficient to allow us to pay principal and interest on our indebtedness and to meet our other obligations. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to sell assets, seek additional capital, or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. In addition, the terms of existing or future debt agreements, including our Credit Facility, may restrict us from pursuing any of these alternatives.\nIn the event that we need to refinance all or a portion of our outstanding indebtedness before maturity or as it matures, we may not be able to obtain terms as favorable as the terms of our existing indebtedness or refinance our existing indebtedness at all. If interest rates or other factors existing at the time of refinancing result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, we will incur higher interest expense. Furthermore, if any rating agency changes our credit rating or outlook, our debt and equity securities could be negatively affected, which could adversely affect our financial condition and financial results.\nOur Credit Facility is guaranteed by substantially all of our domestic subsidiaries and will be required to be guaranteed by future domestic subsidiaries, including those that join us in connection with acquisitions.\nSubstantially all of our U.S. subsidiaries guarantee our obligations under our Credit Facility, and substantially all of their assets are pledged as collateral for the Credit Facility. Future U.S. subsidiaries will be required to provide similar guarantees under the Credit Facility. If we default on any guaranteed indebtedness, our U.S. subsidiaries could be required to make payments under their guarantees, and our senior secured creditors could foreclose on our U.S. subsidiaries\u2019 assets to satisfy unpaid obligations, which would materially adversely affect our business and financial results.\nWe may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the 2023 Convertible Notes or to repurchase the 2023 Convertible Notes upon a fundamental change, and the agreements governing our other indebtedness contain, and our future debt may contain, limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion or repurchase of the 2023 Convertible Notes.\nHolders of the 2023 Convertible Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase their 2023 Convertible Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2023 Convertible Notes to be repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, upon conversion of the 2023 Convertible Notes, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the 2023 Convertible Notes being converted in accordance with the terms of the Indenture governing the 2023 Convertible Notes. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of the 2023 Convertible Notes. Our Credit Facility prohibits us from making any cash payments on the conversion or repurchase of the 2023 Convertible Notes if a default or an event of default under that facility exists or would result from such conversion or repurchase, or if, after giving effect to such conversion or repurchase (and any additional indebtedness incurred in connection with such conversion or a repurchase), we would not be in pro forma compliance with certain financial tests under that the Credit Facility.\nAny new credit facility that we may enter into may have similar restrictions. In addition, our ability to repurchase the 2023 Convertible Notes or to pay cash upon conversions of the 2023 Convertible Notes may be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our future indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase the 2023 Convertible Notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the Indenture or to pay any cash payable on future conversions of the Notes as required by the Indenture would constitute a default under the Indenture. A default under the Indenture or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our existing and future indebtedness. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the 2023 Convertible Notes or make cash payments upon conversions thereof.\nThe conditional conversion feature of the 2023 Convertible Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nIn the event the conditional conversion feature of the 2023 Convertible Notes is triggered, holders of the 2023 Convertible Notes will be entitled to convert the 2023 Convertible Notes at their option at any time during specific periods listed in the Indenture governing the 2023 Convertible Notes. If one or more holders elect to convert their 2023 Convertible Notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their 2023 Convertible Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the 2023 Convertible Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nThe accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as the 2023 Convertible Notes, could have a material effect on our reported financial results.\nUnder Accounting Standards Codification 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options (\u201cASC 470-20\u201d), an entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments (such as the 2023 Convertible Notes) that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer\u2019s economic interest cost. The effect of ASC 470-20 on the accounting for the 2023 Convertible Notes is that the equity component is required to be included in the additional paid-in capital section of stockholders\u2019 equity on our consolidated balance sheet, and the value of the equity component would be treated as original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the 2023 Convertible Notes. As a result, we will be required to record a greater amount of non-cash interest expense in current periods presented as a result of the amortization of the discounted carrying value of the 2023 Convertible Notes to their face amount over the term of the 2023 Convertible Notes. We will report lower net income in our financial results because ASC 470-20 will require interest to include both the current period\u2019s amortization of the debt discount and the instrument\u2019s coupon interest, which could adversely affect our reported or future financial results, the trading price of our common stock and the trading price of the 2023 Convertible Notes.\nIn addition, under certain circumstances, convertible debt instruments (such as the 2023 Convertible Notes) that may be settled entirely or partly in cash are currently accounted for utilizing the treasury stock method, the effect of which is that the shares issuable upon conversion of the 2023 Convertible Notes are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share, except to the extent that the conversion value of the 2023 Convertible Notes exceeds their principal amount. Under the treasury\nstock method, for diluted earnings per share purposes, the transaction is accounted for as if the number of shares of common stock that would be necessary to settle such excess, if we elected to settle such excess in shares, is issued. We cannot be sure that the accounting standards in the future will continue to permit the use of the treasury stock method. If we are unable to use the treasury stock method in accounting for the shares issuable upon conversion of the 2023 Convertible Notes, then our diluted earnings per share would be adversely affected.\nOur variable rate indebtedness will subject us to interest rate risk, which could cause our annual debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nBorrowings under our Credit Facility will be at variable rates of interest, which expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our cash flow could be adversely affected. An increase in debt service obligations under our variable rate indebtedness could affect our ability to make payments required under the terms of the agreements governing our indebtedness or our other indebtedness outstanding from time to time.\nIn July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority of the United Kingdom, which regulates the London Interbank Offering Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d), announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. Our Credit Facility, which was undrawn at December 31, 2019, is indexed to LIBOR and may be used in the future. Although our borrowing arrangement provides for alternative base rates, such alternative base rates and the consequences of the phase out of LIBOR cannot be entirely predicted at this time. An alternative base rate could be higher or more volatile than LIBOR prior to its discontinuance, which could result in an increase in the cost of our indebtedness, impact our ability to refinance some or all of our existing indebtedness or otherwise have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, there can be no assurance given as to whether LIBOR will actually cease to be available after 2021 or whether an alternative rate will become the market benchmark in its place.", "PERMNO": 83509, "SIC": 8721, "TIC": "FCN"}
