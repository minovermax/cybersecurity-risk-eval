{"cik": "1597503", "company": "NorthStar Asset Management Group Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-02", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following risk factors and other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, that we currently deem immaterial or that generally apply to all businesses also may adversely impact our business. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flow and liquidity could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThe asset management business is highly competitive.\nThe asset management business is highly competitive, driven by a variety of factors including asset performance, the quality of service provided to our Managed Companies, brand recognition and business reputation. A number of factors serve to increase our competitive risks:\n\u2022\nother asset managers may have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources and more personnel than we do;\n\u2022\nother asset managers may offer more products and services than we do or be more adept at developing, marketing and managing new products and services than we are;\n\u2022\nour Managed Companies may not perform as well as the clients of other asset managers;\n\u2022\nseveral other asset managers and their clients have significant amounts of capital and many of them have similar management objectives to ours, which may create additional competition for management and acquisition opportunities;\n\u2022\nsome of these other asset managers\u2019 clients may also have a lower cost of capital and access to funding sources that are not available to our Managed Companies, which may create competitive disadvantages for us with respect to funding opportunities;\n\u2022\nsome of these other asset managers\u2019 clients may have higher risk tolerance, different risk assessment or a lower return threshold, which could allow them to facilitate the consideration, acquisition and management by their clients of a wider variety of assets and investments and to advise their clients to bid more aggressively for investment opportunities than we would advise our Managed Companies to bid;\n\u2022\nthere are relatively few barriers to entry impeding new asset management firms and the successful efforts of new entrants into the asset management business is expected to continue to result in increased competition;\n\u2022\nsome other asset managers may have better expertise or be regarded by potential clients as having better expertise with regard to specific assets;\n\u2022\nother asset managers may have more scalable platforms and may operate more efficiently than us;\n\u2022\nother asset managers may have better brand recognition than us and there is no assurance that we will maintain a positive brand in the future; and\n\u2022\nother industry participants may from time to time recruit members of our management team and other employees away from us.\nIn order to compete effectively, we may seek to enter into lines of business outside of commercial real estate and in which we have limited experience. For instance, NorthStar Corporate, which is our first sponsored BDC, is in the process of registration with the SEC.\nWe may lose opportunities in the future if we do not match fees, structures and terms offered by competitors. Alternatively, we may experience a decreased rate of return and increased risk of loss if we match fees, structures and terms offered by competitors. Moreover, if we are forced to compete with other asset managers on the basis of price, we may not be able to maintain our current fees. Fees in our industry may decline, without regard to the historical performance of an asset manager. Fee reductions on existing or future funds, without corresponding decreases in our cost structure, would adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nOur inability to effectively compete in these and other areas may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe commercial real estate industry has been and may continue to be adversely affected by economic conditions in the U.S. and global financial markets generally.\nOur business and operations are currently dependent on the commercial real estate industry generally, which in turn is dependent upon broad economic conditions in the United States, Europe and elsewhere. Despite improvements in the U.S. economy, significant challenges still remain due to the uncertainty surrounding a low inflation rate in the United States, a stronger U.S. dollar, slow global growth and international market volatility. Global economic and political headwinds, along with global market instability and the risk of maturing commercial real estate debt that may have difficulties being refinanced, may continue to cause periodic volatility in the commercial real estate market for some time. Adverse conditions in the\ncommercial real estate industry could harm our business and financial condition by, among other factors, limiting our and our Managed Companies\u2019 access to debt and equity capital and otherwise negatively impacting our operations.\nWe conduct business internationally, which may subject us to numerous political, economic, market, reputational, operational, legal and other risks that could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nWe conduct business internationally and continue to grow our international operations. In addition, our Managed Companies have international investments. Most of our expertise to date is in the United States and neither we nor our Managed Companies have extensive expertise in international markets. Our international operations may be affected by factors peculiar to the laws of the jurisdiction in which our and our Managed Companies business is located and these laws may expose us and our Managed Companies to risks that are different from and/or in addition to those commonly found in the United States. We may not be as familiar with the potential risks to our and our Managed Companies business outside of the United States and we may incur losses as a result. These risks include:\n\u2022\ngovernmental laws, rules and policies, including laws relating to the foreign ownership of real property or mortgages and laws relating to the ability of foreign persons or corporations to remove profits earned from activities within the country to the person's or corporation's country of origin;\n\u2022\ntranslation and transaction risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nadverse market conditions caused by inflation or other changes in national or local political and economic conditions;\n\u2022\nchallenges of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws, including corporate governance, operations, taxes and litigation;\n\u2022\nchanges in relative interest rates;\n\u2022\nthe potential for significant U.S. tax liability upon repatriation of profits earned in foreign jurisdictions, which could result in us keeping such earnings in foreign jurisdictions, thereby limiting our liquidity;\n\u2022\nchanges in the availability, cost and terms of borrowings resulting from varying national economic policies;\n\u2022\nchanges in real estate and other tax rates, the tax treatment of transaction structures and other changes in operating expenses in a particular country where our Managed Companies may have investments;\n\u2022\nlack of uniform accounting standards (including availability of information in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP);\n\u2022\nchanges in the social stability or other political, economic or diplomatic developments in or affecting a country where we or our Managed Companies do business;\n\u2022\nchanges in applicable laws and regulations in the United States that affect foreign operations; and\n\u2022\nlegal and logistical barriers to enforcing our contractual rights in other countries.\nAs a result, our operating infrastructure and expertise may not adequately support our or our Managed Companies international activities.\nWe currently have operations in five countries and substantially all of our revenue in 2014 following the spin-off was derived from our operations outside the United States. Fluctuations in foreign currencies, exchange controls and other restrictions on the repatriation of funds, may significantly affect our operating performance, liquidity and the value of any cash held outside the United States. in local currency. In particular, repatriation of earnings generated by our foreign subsidiaries to the United States may be inefficient from a tax perspective.\nIn addition, changes in policies or laws of U.S. or foreign governments resulting in, among other things, higher taxation, currency conversion limitations, restrictions on fund transfers, capital raising or the expropriation of private enterprises, could reduce the anticipated benefits of our international expansion. Any actions by countries in which we conduct business to reverse policies that encourage investment could adversely affect our business. If we fail to realize the anticipated growth of our future international operations, our business and operating results could suffer.\nWe are predominantly dependent on NorthStar Realty and the Sponsored Companies as our only Managed Companies, the loss of which, or their inability to pay for our services, could substantially reduce our revenue.\nOur Managed Companies are the only companies for which we currently provide services for a fee. As of the date of this Annual Report, we provide services to NorthStar Realty and our four operating Sponsored Companies. One additional Sponsored Company confidentially submitted a registration statement with the SEC that has not yet been declared effective. The loss or failure of these Managed Companies, their failure to pay us or termination of their management agreements would adversely affect our revenue, results of operations and financial condition. Therefore, our business is subject to the risks of the\nbusinesses of our Managed Companies. Refer to \u201cRisks Related to the Businesses of Our Managed Companies.\u201d For example, if NorthStar Realty were to breach or were unable to satisfy its material obligations under our management agreement, including a failure to pay asset management, incentive and other fees under the management agreement, or if NorthStar Realty were to terminate the management agreement for cause, we could suffer significant losses. Such a failure could also lead to a decline or other adverse effects to our operating results and could harm our ability to execute our business plan.\nBecause the management agreements with our Sponsored Companies are subject to limitation or cancellation, any such termination could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe agreements under which we provide management and other services to our current Sponsored Companies, or any other non-traded company we may sponsor in the future, are renewable upon mutual consent of the parties for an unlimited number of successive one-year periods. These agreements may generally be terminated by each current Sponsored Company immediately for cause, or upon 60 days\u2019 written notice, without cause or for good reason, and expire on an annual basis, unless otherwise renewed. We anticipate that our Sponsored Companies will pursue a liquidity transaction in the future and, if successful, any such liquidity transaction could result in termination or expiration of these agreements. There can be no assurance that these agreements will not expire or be terminated. Any such termination or expiration could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nOur ability to raise capital and attract investors at our current, and any future, Managed Company is critical to their success and consequently our ability to grow our asset management business.\nOur asset management, incentive and other fees are significantly driven by our ability to raise capital for our current and any future Managed Company. These risks are dependent on various factors beyond our control, including monetary and fiscal policies, domestic and international economic conditions, political considerations, regulatory issues and capital markets. The effect of such risks on our asset management, incentive and other fee agreements may vary based on the management agreement with the respective Managed Company. Refer to \u201cBusiness\u201d for further information regarding the management agreements with our current Managed Companies.\nFor instance, the management agreement that we entered into with NorthStar Realty consists of a base management fee that increases as equity is raised and an incentive fee based on the performance of NorthStar Realty using CAD as a performance metric. The base management fee currently represents the majority of the fee. The ability of NorthStar Realty to grow is dependent on access to the capital markets to raise equity and/or debt. To the extent that general capital markets activity slows down or comes to a halt (as was the case during the recession that began in 2008), NorthStar Realty may have difficulty growing. This risk is based on micro- and macro-economic market factors including but not limited to disruptions in the debt and equity capital markets, resulting in the lack of access to capital or prohibitively high costs of obtaining or replacing capital. Despite recent improvements, the markets could suffer another severe downturn and another liquidity crisis could emerge.\nOur platform may not be as scalable as we anticipate and we could face difficulties growing our business without significant new investment in personnel and infrastructure.\nWhile we believe our platform for operating our business is highly scalable and can support significant growth without substantial new investment in personnel and infrastructure on a relative basis, we may be wrong in that assessment. Our business and assets under management have grown substantially over the past year, which has placed additional demands on management and other personnel, as well as our support infrastructure. For instance, on July 1, 2014, our first day operating separately from NorthStar Realty, our assets under management were $16.7 billion. As of December 31, 2014, our assets under management were $21.7 billion. If our business continues to grow substantially, we will need to make significant new investment in personnel and infrastructure to support that growth. We may be unable to make significant investments on a timely basis or at reasonable costs, and our failure in this regard could disrupt our business and operations.\nWe may not realize the anticipated benefits of our strategic partnerships and joint ventures.\nWe have and may continue to enter into strategic partnerships and joint ventures to support the significant growth of our business. We may also make investments in partnerships or other co-ownership arrangements or participations with third parties. For instance, during 2014 and 2015, we entered into strategic partnerships and/or joint ventures with Mr. Flaherty, AHI and Island. We also may co-sponsor certain Managed Companies with third parties, such as NorthStar/RXR New York Metro and NorthStar Corporate. In connection with these investments, these partners provide, among other things, property management, investment advisory and other services to certain of our Managed Companies.\nWe may not realize any of the anticipated benefits of our strategic partnerships and joint ventures. Such investments and any future strategic partnerships and/or joint ventures subject us and our Managed Companies to risks and uncertainties not otherwise present with other methods of investment, including, for instance, the following risks:\n\u2022\nour joint venture partner in an investment could become insolvent or bankrupt;\n\u2022\nfraud or other misconduct by our joint venture partners;\n\u2022\nwe may share decision-making authority with our joint venture partner regarding certain major decisions affecting the ownership of the joint venture, which may prevent us from taking actions that are opposed by our joint venture partner;\n\u2022\nsuch joint venture partner may at any time have economic or business interests or goals that are or that become in conflict with our business interests or goals;\n\u2022\nsuch joint venture partner may be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions or requests or contrary to our policies or objectives; and\n\u2022\nthe terms of our joint ventures could restrict our ability to sell or transfer our interest to a third party when we desire on advantageous terms, which could result in reduced liquidity.\nIn addition, to the extent our joint venture investment represents a minority interest in the joint venture, the controlling partner(s) may be able to take actions which are not in our or our Managed Companies\u2019 best interests because of our lack of full control. Furthermore, to the extent that our joint venture partner provides services to our Managed Companies, certain conflicts of interest will exist.\nAny of the above might subject us to liabilities and thus reduce our returns on our investment with that joint venture partner. In addition, disagreements or disputes between us and our joint venture partner could result in litigation, which could increase our expenses and potentially limit the time and effort our officers and directors are able to devote to our business.\nWe may determine to grow our business through the acquisition of asset management contracts or companies, which entails substantial risk.\nWe may determine to grow our business through the acquisition of asset management contracts or companies. Such acquisitions entail substantial risk. During our due diligence of such acquisitions, we may not uncover all relevant liabilities and we may have limited, if any, recourse against the sellers. We may overpay to acquire asset management contracts or companies and these transactions may not be accretive or we could suffer significant losses. We also may not successfully integrate the asset management contracts or companies that we acquire into our business and operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition. Additionally, to the extent such acquisitions result in us entering new lines of business, we may become subject to new laws and regulations with which we are not familiar, or from which we are currently exempt, potentially leading to increased litigation and regulatory risk.\nThe development of new products and services may expose NSAM to additional costs or operational risk.\nNSAM\u2019s financial performance depends, in part, on its ability to develop, market and manage new products and services. For instance, our Sponsored Company, NorthStar Corporate, which is our first sponsored BDC, is in the process of registration with the SEC. The development and introduction of new products and services may require significant time and resources, as well as ongoing support and investment. Substantial risk and uncertainties are associated with the introduction of new products and services, including the implementation of new and appropriate operational controls and procedures, shifting client and market preferences, the introduction of competing products or services and compliance with regulatory requirements. Failure to successfully manage these risks may cause NSAM\u2019s revenues and costs to fluctuate and could have an adverse effect on its business and reputation.\nOur ability to operate our business successfully would be harmed if key personnel terminate their employment with us.\nOur future success depends, to a significant extent, upon the continued services of our key personnel, including our executive officers, which include our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David T. Hamamoto, our President, Albert Tylis, and Daniel R. Gilbert, the Chief Investment and Operating Officer of NorthStar Asset Management Group, Ltd, our wholly-owned subsidiary, in particular. For instance, the extent and nature of the experience of our executive officers and the nature of the relationships they have developed with real estate professionals and financial institutions are critical to the success of our business. We cannot assure stockholders of their continued employment with us. The loss of services of certain of our executive officers could harm our business and our prospects.\nOur board of directors has adopted, and will likely in the future adopt, certain incentive plans to create incentives that will allow us to retain and attract the services of key employees. These incentive plans may be tied to the performance of our common stock and a decline in our stock price may result in us being unable to motivate and retain our management and these other employees. Our inability to motivate and retain these individuals could also harm our business and our prospects. Additionally, competition for experienced real estate professionals could require us to pay higher wages and provide additional benefits to attract qualified employees, which could result in higher compensation expenses to us.\nIf our portfolio management techniques and strategies are not effective, we may be exposed to material unanticipated losses.\nWe continue to refine our portfolio management techniques, strategies and assessment methods. However, our portfolio management techniques and strategies may not fully mitigate the risk exposure of our operations in all economic or market\nenvironments, or against all types of risk, including risks that we might fail to identify or anticipate. Any failures in our portfolio management techniques and strategies to accurately quantify such risk exposure could limit our ability to manage risks in our operations and could result in losses.\nWe are highly dependent on information systems and systems failures could significantly disrupt our business.\nAs an asset manager our business is highly dependent on information technology systems, including systems provided by third parties for which we have no control. Various measures have been implemented to manage our risks related to the information technology systems, but any failure or interruption of our systems could cause delays or other problems in our activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance. Potential sources for disruption, damage or failure of our information technology systems include, without limitation, computer viruses, security breaches, human error, cyber attacks, natural disasters and defects in design.\nFailure to implement effective information and cyber security policies, procedures and capabilities could disrupt our business and harm our results of operations.\nWe are dependent on the effectiveness of our information and cyber security policies, procedures and capabilities to protect our computer and telecommunications systems and the data that resides on or is transmitted through them. An externally caused information security incident, such as a hacker attack, virus or worm, or an internally caused issue, such as failure to control access to sensitive systems, could materially interrupt business operations or cause disclosure or modification of sensitive or confidential information and could result in material financial loss, loss of competitive position, regulatory actions, breach of contracts, reputational harm or legal liability.\nSignificant legal proceedings may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nWe may in the future be involved in litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business and may potentially be involved in other legal proceedings, including securities class actions and regulatory and governmental investigations. We are unable to predict with certainty the eventual outcome of any litigation we may be involved in. Developments adverse to us in legal proceedings to which we may be subject in the future could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or our reputation.\nMisconduct by third-party selling broker-dealers or our broker-dealer sales force could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely on selling broker-dealers and our broker-dealer sales force to properly offer equity in our current and future Sponsored Companies to investors in compliance with our selling agreements and with applicable regulatory requirements. While these persons are responsible for their activities as registered broker-dealers, their actions may nonetheless result in complaints or legal or regulatory action against us. These actions could also directly or indirectly harm the industry generally or our reputation specifically, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, we may have indemnification obligations under certain selling agreements and dealer agreements for misconduct by such broker-dealers.\nWe act as special servicer with respect to certain securitization transactions and we may make decisions that subject us to loss and expose us to liability from third parties.\nWe act as special servicer with respect to certain securitization transactions. When acting in that capacity, we are responsible for servicing the subject assets in accordance with applicable industry standards, laws, regulations and contractual obligations. As special servicer, we are responsible for critical functions that can have a significant effect on the value of the underlying assets. If we fail to adhere to applicable industry standards, laws, regulations or contractual obligations, or if we make decisions that are not effective, we could suffer significant losses and expose ourselves to substantial liability from third parties who were relying on our servicing function.\nWe may incur costs in excess of our expectations as an independent public company.\nWe may incur costs and expenses greater than those we anticipated as a result of our separation from NorthStar Realty. These increased costs and expenses may arise from various factors, including financial reporting, costs associated with complying with federal securities laws (including compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Investment Advisers Act), tax administration, and legal and human resources related functions. There can be no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient returns to pay our operating expenses and make satisfactory distributions to our stockholders or any distributions at all.\nWe may not be able to access financing sources on attractive terms, if at all, which could adversely affect our ability to grow our business.\nWhile we do not currently significantly rely on financing, we may increasingly rely on outside capital to fund and grow our business in the future. If our financing and capital needs increase, our business may be adversely affected by disruptions in the debt and equity capital markets and institutional lending market, including the lack of access to capital or prohibitively high\ncosts of obtaining or replacing capital, both domestically and abroad. Access to the capital markets and other sources of liquidity were severely disrupted during the recession that began in 2008. Despite recent improvements, the markets could suffer another severe downturn and another liquidity crisis could emerge. Based on the current conditions, we do not know whether any sources of capital will be available to us in the future on terms that are acceptable to us, if at all. If we cannot obtain sufficient debt and equity capital on acceptable terms, our business and our ability to operate could be severely impacted. For information about our available sources of funds, refer to Part II, Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d and the notes to our consolidated financial statements located in Part II, Item 8. \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe may use leverage in connection with our business, which may increase the risk of loss associated with our business.\nNorthStar Realty provided us with a $250 million revolving credit facility with a five-year term. We may also use additional financing arrangements in the future. High leverage may, particularly during difficult economic times, increase our risk of loss and harm our liquidity, thereby reducing cash available for distribution to stockholders, for our operations and for future business opportunities.\nWe may not be able to engage in desirable strategic or capital-raising transactions for a period of time following the spin-off. In addition, we could be liable for adverse tax consequences resulting from engaging in significant strategic or capital-raising transactions.\nFor a period of time following the spin-off, we may be prohibited, except in specific circumstances, from: (i) entering into any transaction pursuant to which all or a portion of our stock would be acquired, whether by merger or otherwise if, as a result of such a transaction and any related equity issuances or redemptions, 50% or more of our stock is acquired; or (ii) taking or failing to take action that prevents the spin-off and related transactions from being tax-free.\nThese restrictions may limit our ability for a period of time to pursue strategic arrangements or engage in new business or other transactions that may maximize the value of our business.\nWe are subject to federal and applicable state and local income tax and our future effective tax rates could be affected by the allocation of our income among different geographic regions, challenges to our international structure and tax law changes, which could affect our future operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe are fully taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes. Our effective tax rate is directly affected by the relative proportions of revenue and income before taxes in the various domestic and international jurisdictions in which we operate. Our consolidated pre-tax income is subject to foreign tax at relatively lower tax rates when compared to the U.S. federal statutory tax rate and, as a consequence, our effective income tax rate is expected to be lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate. However, we are subject to changing tax laws, treaties, and regulations in multiple jurisdictions in which we operate. These tax laws, treaties and regulations are highly complex and subject to interpretation. In addition, it is possible that the valuation of our contractual arrangements between us and our wholly owned foreign subsidiaries could be challenged. Moreover, legislation has been proposed that, if enacted, would classify certain foreign corporations that are managed and controlled primarily in the United States as domestic corporations for United States tax purposes, which could adversely affect the relative mix of United States and international income. We cannot predict whether this or other similar legislative proposals will become law. Thus, our future effective income tax rates could be adversely affected if tax authorities challenge our international structure, the relative mix of United States and international income changes for any reason, or tax laws were to change in the future. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that our income tax rate will be less than the United States federal statutory rate in future periods.\nWe believe CAD, a non-GAAP measure, provides a meaningful indicator of our operating performance; however, CAD should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP as an indicator of operating performance.\nManagement primarily uses CAD to evaluate our profitability and our board of directors will consider CAD in determining our quarterly cash distributions. CAD is a non-GAAP financial measure. In addition, the incentive fees to which we may be entitled pursuant to our management agreement with NorthStar Realty are determined using NorthStar Realty\u2019s CAD as a performance metric. We believe that CAD is useful because it adjusts net income (loss) for a variety of non-cash, one-time and certain non-recurring items. We calculate CAD by subtracting from or adding to net income (loss): equity-based compensation, depreciation related items, foreign currency gains (losses), straight-line rent, adjustments for joint ventures, deferred tax (benefit) expense and transaction and other costs. In future periods, such adjustments may include amortization of deferred financing costs, impairment on goodwill and other intangibles and other one-time events pursuant to changes in U.S. GAAP and certain other non-recurring items. These items, if applicable, include any adjustments for unconsolidated ventures.\nCAD should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss), determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as an indicator of operating performance. In addition, our methodology for calculating CAD may differ from the methodologies used\nby other comparable companies when calculating the same or similar supplemental financial measures and may not be comparable with these companies.\nRisks Relating to Our Relationships with our Managed Companies\nThe organization and management of our Managed Companies and any future companies we may manage may create conflicts of interest.\nWe are party to management and other agreements with our Managed Companies and owe certain duties to these companies under such agreements and applicable law, including the Investment Advisers Act. These Managed Companies, along with new future managed companies, funds or vehicles that we manage, advise or sub-advise, including companies, funds and vehicles that are subject to a strategic relationship between us and our strategic or joint venture partners will acquire assets consistent with their investment objectives and that are allocated in accordance with our investment allocation policy, which we adopted to ensure that investments are allocated fairly and appropriately among our Managed Companies, our strategic partnerships or our joint ventures over time. When determining the entity for which an investment opportunity would be the most suitable, the factors that our investment professionals may consider include, among other factors, the following:\n\u2022\ninvestment objectives, strategy and criteria;\n\u2022\ncash requirements;\n\u2022\neffect of the investment on the diversification of the portfolio, including by geography, size of investment, type of investment and risk of investment;\n\u2022\nleverage policy and the availability of financing for the investment by each entity;\n\u2022\nanticipated cash flow of the asset to be acquired;\n\u2022\nincome tax effects of the purchase;\n\u2022\nthe size of the investment;\n\u2022\nthe amount of funds available;\n\u2022\ncost of capital;\n\u2022\nrisk return profiles;\n\u2022\ntargeted distribution rates;\n\u2022\nanticipated future pipeline of suitable investments;\n\u2022\nthe expected holding period of the investment and the remaining term of our Managed Companies, if applicable;\n\u2022\naffiliate and/or related party considerations; and\n\u2022\nwhether a strategic vehicle has received a special allocation (as defined in the investment allocation policy).\nIf, after consideration of the relevant factors, we determine that an investment is equally suitable for more than one of our current Managed Companies, strategic partnerships or joint ventures, the investment will be allocated among each of the applicable entities on a rotating basis. If, after an investment has been allocated to one Managed Company, our strategic partnerships or our joint ventures, a subsequent event or development, such as delays in structuring or closing on the investment, makes it, in the opinion of our investment professionals, more appropriate for another entity to fund the investment, we may determine to place the investment with the more appropriate entity while still giving credit to the original allocation. In certain situations, we may determine to allow more than one investment vehicle to co-invest in a particular investment.\nThere is no assurance that this policy will remain in place during the entire period we are seeking investment opportunities on behalf of our Managed Companies, our strategic partnerships or our joint ventures, increasing the risk of conflicts of interest. In addition, we may manage additional investment vehicles in the future and, in connection with the creation of such investment vehicles, may revise these allocation procedures. The result of a revision to the allocation procedures may, among other things, be to increase the number of parties who have the right to participate in investment opportunities sourced by us, increasing the risk of conflicts of interest.\nIn addition, under this policy, our investment professionals may consider the investment objectives and anticipated pipeline of future investments of the investment vehicles that we manage. We may choose, for a variety of reasons, to direct investment opportunities in the healthcare industry to NorthStar Healthcare rather than to NorthStar Realty or one of our other Sponsored Companies or vice versa. The decision of how any potential investment should be allocated among our Managed Companies, our strategic partnerships or our joint ventures for which such investment may be suitable may, in many cases, be a matter of subjective judgment which will be made by us.\nWe may also have interests in third parties, such as management firms which manage certain of our Managed Companies\u2019 properties for a fee, which may cause our interests to differ from those of our Managed Companies. If our interests and those of our Managed Companies are not aligned, we may face conflicts of interests that result in action or inaction that is detrimental to us, our Managed Companies, our strategic partnerships or our joint ventures.\nAppropriately dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and difficult and our reputation could be damaged if we fail, or appear to fail, to deal appropriately with one or more potential or actual conflicts of interest. Regulatory scrutiny of, or litigation in connection with, conflicts of interest would have a material adverse effect on our reputation, which would materially adversely affect our business and our ability to attract investors for future vehicles.\nConflicts of interest may also arise in the allocation of fees and costs among our Managed Companies that we incur in connection with the management of their assets. This allocation sometimes requires us to exercise discretion and there is no guarantee that we will allocate these fees and costs appropriately.\nIn addition to the management fees we receive from our Managed Companies, we are reimbursed by our Managed Companies for costs and expenses we incur on their behalf, including indirect personnel and employment costs that we allocate to our Managed Companies and disputes could arise in connection with those allocations.\nWe are paid substantial fees for the services we and our subsidiaries provide to our Managed Companies and we are also reimbursed by our Managed Companies for costs and expenses we incur and pay on their behalf. Our Managed Companies reimburse us, subject to certain limitations and exceptions, for both direct expenses as well as indirect costs, including our personnel and employment costs. The costs and expenses that we allocate to our Managed Companies can be substantial. There are conflicts of interest that arise when we make allocation determinations. For the year ended 2014, we allocated $30 million in costs to our Managed Companies. Our Managed Companies could dispute the amount of costs we allocate to them and the methodologies we use to determine those amounts. Any dispute regarding our allocation of costs and expenses could be distracting, expensive and harm our reputation as well as have other adverse effects on our company and future operating performance, including the potential that our Managed Companies could seek to terminate their relationship with us.\nOur board of directors has enacted resolutions that may result in the diversion of corporate opportunities to and other conflicts with our Managed Companies.\nOur board of directors has enacted resolutions that recognize that our directors and executive officers may also be serving as directors, officers, employees, consultants or agents of our Managed Companies and their subsidiaries and that we may engage in material business transactions with such entities. We have renounced our rights to certain business opportunities and no director or officer of ours who is also serving as a director, officer, employee, consultant or agent of our Managed Companies or any of their subsidiaries will be liable to us or to our stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty that would otherwise exist by reason of the fact that any such individual directs a corporate opportunity (other than certain limited types of opportunities set forth in resolutions enacted by our board of directors) to our Managed Companies or any of their subsidiaries instead of us, or does not refer or communicate information regarding such corporate opportunities to us. These resolutions also expressly validate certain contracts, agreements, assignments and transactions (and amendments, modifications or terminations thereof) between us and our Managed Companies and any of their subsidiaries and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, provide that the actions of the overlapping directors or officers in connection therewith are not breaches of fiduciary duties owed to us, any of our subsidiaries or our respective stockholders.\nOur executive officers and professionals face competing demands relating to their time and conflicts of interests in performing services on behalf of our Managed Companies, which may cause our operations and stockholders\u2019 investment to suffer.\nOur executives and other real estate and finance professionals may face conflicts of interest in allocating their time among our Managed Companies. These conflicts of interest, as well as the loyalties of these individuals to other entities and investors, could result in action or inaction that is detrimental to our business, which could harm the implementation of our business strategy and our reputation.\nFailure of our Managed Companies to effectively perform their obligations to us and to third parties could have an adverse effect on our business and performance.\nIn connection with the spin-off, we entered into various agreements with NorthStar Realty governing our relationship with NorthStar Realty subsequent to the spin-off. These agreements provide that all liabilities and obligations attributable to periods prior to the spin-off remain with NorthStar Realty, except for the liabilities for which NorthStar Realty agreed to contribute cash to us to enable us to pay such liabilities. We and NorthStar Realty also agreed to provide each other with indemnities with respect to liabilities arising out of the period after the spin-off. If NorthStar Realty were to fail to provide this indemnity and we were found liable, our financial condition and results of operation could be materially and adversely affected.\nIn addition, NorthStar Realty has agreed to provide certain loan origination services to us. Our ability to fulfill our business strategy relies upon NorthStar Realty providing these services and any failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe also have entered into a third party selling agreement with one of our Sponsored Companies and a third party pursuant to which we agreed to indemnify such third party against certain breaches by our Sponsored Company. We may enter into similar arrangements in the future. If our Sponsored Companies fail to fulfill their obligations under these agreements, our potential liability as a result of our indemnification obligations could materially adversely affect our business and performance.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Matters\nWe are subject to substantial regulation, numerous contractual obligations and extensive internal policies and failure to comply with these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe and our subsidiaries are subject to substantial regulation, numerous contractual obligations and extensive internal policies. Given our organizational structure, we are subject to or expect to be subject to regulation by the SEC, the NYSE, FINRA and other federal, state and local or international governmental bodies and agencies. We are also responsible for managing the regulatory aspects of our Managed Companies, including compliance with applicable REIT rules. These regulations are extensive, complex and require substantial management time and attention. If we fail to comply with any of the regulations that apply to our business, we could be subjected to extensive investigations as well as substantial penalties, and our business and operations could be materially adversely affected.\nOur lack of compliance with applicable law could result in, among other penalties, our inability to enforce contracts and our ineligibility to contract with and receive revenue from the federal government or other governmental authorities and agencies. We also have numerous contractual obligations that we must adhere to on a continuous basis to operate our business, the default of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. We have also established internal policies designed to ensure that we manage our business in accordance with applicable law and regulation and in accordance with our contractual obligations. While we have designed policies to assist us with appropriately operating our business, these internal policies may not be effective and, further, if we fail to comply with our internal policies, we could be subjected to additional risk and liability.\nCertain of our subsidiaries are registered with the SEC as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Advisers Act, and/or as a fund services business in the Bailiwick of Jersey, which could hinder our operating performance and negatively impact our stockholders\u2019 return on investment.\nCertain of our subsidiaries are registered with the SEC as investment advisers under the Investment Advisers Act and as a fund services business by the JFSC. Such registration results in certain aspects of our asset management business being supervised by the SEC and the JFSC. The Investment Advisers Act, in particular, requires registered investment advisers to comply with numerous obligations, including compliance, record-keeping, operating and marketing requirements, disclosure obligations and limitations on certain activities. Investment advisers also owe fiduciary duties to their clients. These regulatory and fiduciary obligations may result in increased costs or administrative burdens or otherwise adversely impact our business, including by preventing us from recommending investment opportunities that otherwise meet the respective investment criteria of our Managed Companies. We have only been registered as an investment adviser and/or fund manager since the spin-off and therefore have limited experience in complying with applicable investment adviser and/or fund manager regulations. If we do not comply with these requirements, we may not be able to provide management services to our Managed Companies to the extent they invest in securities.\nThe failure of our subsidiaries to comply with these regulations could cause the SEC or the JFSC to institute proceedings and impose sanctions, termination of our registration or prohibition from serving as an adviser and/or manager to certain funds and could lead to litigation by investors in our Managed Companies or harm to our reputation, any of which could cause our business and operations to be materially adversely affected.\nIf we are deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act, our business would be subject to applicable restrictions there under, which could make it impracticable for us to continue our business as contemplated and would have a material adverse impact on the market price of our common stock.\nWe do not believe that we are an \u201cinvestment company\u201d under the Investment Company Act because the nature of our assets excludes us from the definition of an investment company under the Investment Company Act. In addition, we believe our company is not an investment company pursuant to Rule 3a-1 of the Investment Company Act because we have no more than 45% of our assets invested in and derive no more than 45% of our income from investment securities. We intend to conduct our operations so that we will not be deemed an investment company. If we were to be deemed an investment company, however, restrictions imposed by the Investment Company Act, including limitations on our capital structure and our ability to\ntransact with affiliates, could make it impractical for us to continue our business as contemplated and would have a material adverse effect on our businesses and the price of our common stock.\nWe do business internationally, which may subject us to numerous regulatory and other risks that could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nOur business is subject to extensive regulation by governmental and other authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate around the world. Similar to the United States, the current environment in jurisdictions outside the United States, in particular Europe, has become subject to further regulation. Governmental regulators and other authorities in Europe have proposed or implemented a number of initiatives and additional rules and regulations that could adversely affect our business.\nWe may also experience difficulty entering new international markets due to regulatory barriers, the necessity of adapting to new regulatory systems and problems related to entering new markets with different cultural bases and political systems. These difficulties may prevent, or significantly increase the cost of, our international expansion. We may also leverage partners or other third parties to provide local expertise or regulatory authority, which may create additional risks as we may be dependent upon, and subject to, liability or reputational damage relating to services or personnel outside of our control.\nGovernment and self-regulatory organization intervention may limit our ability to continue to implement certain strategies or manage certain risks.\nGovernment and self-regulatory organizations have significant influence over the regulatory framework under which our company operates. In the past, these organizations have also undertaken significant measures to influence market forces including quantitative easing, direct capital infusions into struggling industries or other programs and strategies.\nSuch intervention has also in certain cases been implemented on an \u201cemergency\u201d basis, suddenly and substantially eliminating market participants\u2019 ability to continue to implement certain strategies or manage the risk of their outstanding positions. It is impossible to predict what, if any, additional interim or permanent governmental restrictions may be imposed on the markets and the effect of such restrictions on us and our results of operations. There is a high likelihood of significantly increased regulation of the financial markets that could have an impact on our operating results and financial condition.\nRisks Related to the Businesses of Our Managed Companies\nThe risks associated with our Managed Companies\u2019 businesses that could adversely affect their ability to grow their assets, generate revenue and pay our asset management fee are risks to our business.\nWe provide asset management and other services to our Managed Companies. In connection with these services, our Managed Companies pay us periodic asset management fees as well as certain other fees, as provided for under the governing agreements. These agreements also provide for the allocation of certain general corporate and administrative expenses, employee benefits, taxes and certain other liabilities and obligations. The risks associated with each of our Managed Companies\u2019 businesses could adversely affect their ability to carry out their respective business plans. As a result, the risks to their businesses could affect their ability to pay us our asset management, incentive and other fees or reimburse us for expenses that are allocated to them, which would therefore adversely affect our ability to grow our business.\nOur Managed Companies are currently public companies and their filings with the SEC detail the risks associated with the businesses of our Managed Companies. These risks include, but are not limited to, the following risks that could particularly impact their ability to raise capital if applicable, make new investments and pay us our asset management, incentive and other fees, thereby adversely affecting our business, results of operations and financial condition:\n\u2022\nour Managed Companies rely on outside sources of capital that have been challenged by U.S. and global economic and market conditions;\n\u2022\nchallenging economic and financial market conditions could significantly reduce the amount of income our Managed Companies earn on their investments and reduce the value of their investments, harming their ability to raise funds, if applicable, and make new investments;\n\u2022\nchanges in investor preferences or market conditions could limit our Managed Companies\u2019 ability to raise funds, if applicable, or make new investments;\n\u2022\nchanges in tax laws, regulation or accounting rules may make certain types of investments less attractive to potential sellers and lessees, which could negatively affect the ability of our Managed Companies to increase the amount of assets of those types under management;\n\u2022\nour Managed Companies face significant competition for attractive investment opportunities from other real estate investors, some of which have greater financial resources, including publicly-traded REITs, non-traded REITs, insurance companies, commercial and investment banking firms, private institutional funds, hedge funds, private\nequity funds and other investors and such competition may limit the amount of new investments that we are able to offer our Managed Companies;\n\u2022\nour Managed Companies\u2019 CRE equity investments, CRE debt and mortgage loans underlying their CRE securities are subject to the risks typically associated with commercial real estate, which create risks to their businesses that may adversely affect their ability to profit from those investments and raise additional funds, if applicable;\n\u2022\nour Managed Companies have significant investments in certain asset classes, such as healthcare, hotels, manufactured housing communities and limited partnership interests in real estate private equity funds and the impact of adverse conditions on those specific asset classes could negatively impact their business and their ability to continue to raise capital, if applicable;\n\u2022\ncertain of our Managed Companies\u2019 investments may be concentrated in a geographic location and our Managed Companies have not and do not plan to establish any investment criteria to limit their exposure to risks of geographic concentration for future investments; additionally, we have limited expertise in managing investments outside the United States and we, and our Managed Companies, may incur losses as a result;\n\u2022\neconomic conditions, both domestic and international, may impact the tenants/operators of the real property owned by our Managed Companies, as well as the borrowers of the commercial real estate debt originated and acquired by our Managed Companies and the commercial mortgage loans underlying the commercial mortgage backed securities, or CMBS, in which our Managed Companies have invested, impacting our Managed Companies\u2019 business and their ability to grow their business;\n\u2022\ncertain of our Managed Companies\u2019 investments, particularly hotels and healthcare properties, are dependent upon third-party managers for their operation;\n\u2022\nour Managed Companies may be required to finance renovations and capital improvements, particularly in their hotel and healthcare properties, which could result in disruptions to operations, disputes and liquidity shortages;\n\u2022\nour Managed Companies are exposed to environmental, building and other laws, natural disasters and other factors beyond their control as a result of their ownership of real estate;\n\u2022\nour Managed Companies have in the past and expect to continue to make opportunistic investments that may involve asset classes and structures with which they have less familiarity, thereby increasing their risk of loss, potentially adversely impacting their businesses and ability to raise additional capital, if applicable;\n\u2022\nsome of our Managed Companies have pursued and plan to continue to pursue expansion opportunities outside the United States and our lack of extensive expertise in international markets to-date could expose us and them to additional operating and regulatory risks;\n\u2022\nour Managed Companies may be unable to complete additional securitization transactions due to, among other things, a decrease in liquidity in the commercial real estate market;\n\u2022\nour Managed Companies may be unable to obtain financing required to originate or acquire investments as contemplated in their business plan, which could compel our Managed Companies to restructure or abandon a particular origination or acquisition and harm their ability to expand their businesses;\n\u2022\ncertain of our Managed Companies have portfolios that are highly leveraged, which may adversely affect the return on their investments;\n\u2022\nmaintenance of our Managed Companies\u2019 Investment Company Act exemption imposes limits on our Managed Companies\u2019 operations, which may adversely impact our Managed Companies\u2019 ability to invest capital in their businesses;\n\u2022\nour Managed Companies\u2019 failure to continue to qualify as REITs would subject them to federal income tax and reduce CAD to their stockholders, adversely impacting their ability to raise capital, if applicable, and operate their business; and\n\u2022\ncomplying with REIT or BDC requirements may cause our Managed Companies to forego otherwise attractive opportunities or liquidate otherwise attractive investments.\nAdditional risks associated with the healthcare assets of NorthStar Realty and the business of NorthStar Healthcare include:\n\u2022\nthe healthcare industry is highly competitive and we expect it to become more competitive and such competition may affect the ability of NorthStar Realty, NorthStar Healthcare or any other companies we may manage to make acquisitions or may increase the cost of these acquisitions which, in turn, could materially adversely affect their business, financial condition and results of operations;\n\u2022\nthe failure of the tenants/operators of healthcare facilities to comply with licensing and certification requirements, the requirements of governmental reimbursement programs, such as Medicare or Medicaid, fraud and abuse regulations or new legislative developments may materially adversely affect the business, financial condition and results of operations of NorthStar Realty, NorthStar Healthcare or any other companies we may manage;\n\u2022\nthe healthcare industry is heavily regulated; new laws or regulations, such as the healthcare reform law and related regulations, changes to existing laws or regulations, loss of licensure or failure to obtain licensure could materially adversely affect the business, financial condition and results of operations of NorthStar Realty, NorthStar Healthcare or any other companies we may manage;\n\u2022\ngovernment budget deficits could lead to a reduction in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement as well as substantial delays in payments;\n\u2022\nadverse trends in healthcare provider operations may negatively affect lease revenue and the business of NorthStar Realty, NorthStar Healthcare or any other companies we may manage; and\n\u2022\nwe may not realize the benefits we expect from the strategic arrangement with Mr. Flaherty.\nChallenging economic and financial market conditions could significantly reduce the amount of income our Managed Companies earn on their investments and further reduce the value of their investments.\nChallenging economic and financial market conditions may result in delinquencies, non-performing assets and taking title to collateral and a decrease in the value of the property or other collateral which secures our Managed Companies\u2019 investments, all of which could adversely affect their results of operations. Our Managed Companies may incur substantial loan losses and need to establish significant provision for loan losses or impairment. Revenue from our Managed Companies\u2019 properties could diminish significantly.\nOur Managed Companies hold a diversified portfolio of equity and debt investments. As a result of the economic and market conditions, revenue generated by the properties and other assets underlying any investments they may make could decrease, making it more difficult for borrowers and tenants/operators to meet their payment obligations to our Managed Companies. In addition, the value of collateral securing any of their debt investments could decrease below the outstanding principal amount of such investment. Each of these factors would increase the likelihood of default and taking title to collateral or transferring title of collateral to a third-party lender, which would likely have a negative impact on the value of our Managed Companies\u2019 portfolios.\nMore generally, the risks arising from the current financial market and economic conditions are applicable to all of the investments our Managed Companies may make, including their debt investments, whether mortgage, subordinate or other loans or direct senior housing and other healthcare real estate investments, the performance of which depends on the performance of the operator to which the property is leased, whose business may be adversely impacted by these conditions.\nThese conditions, or similar conditions that may exist in the future, may materially adversely affect our Managed Companies\u2019 business, financial condition and results of operations, and their ability to make distributions to stockholders. Among other potential consequences, a prolonged economic slowdown or recession may materially adversely affect:\n\u2022\nour Managed Companies\u2019 ability to borrow on terms and conditions that they find acceptable, or at all, which could reduce their ability to pursue origination and acquisition opportunities and refinance existing borrowings, reduce returns from their origination and acquisition activities and increase their future interest expense;\n\u2022\nthe financial condition of their tenants/operators, which may result in defaults under leases due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failures or for other reasons; and\n\u2022\nthe value of our Managed Companies\u2019 real estate and the ability of their tenants/operators to make their lease or mortgage payments, and in certain circumstances, their ability to dispose of these assets at attractive prices or to obtain financing collateralized by these assets.\nIf our Managed Companies perform poorly, we will have substantial difficulty growing our assets under management and attracting capital for new Managed Companies.\nNon-traded companies have been the subject of increased scrutiny by regulators and media outlets resulting from inquires and investigations initiated by FINRA and the SEC and could also become the subject of scrutiny and face difficulties in raising capital should negative perceptions develop regarding non-traded REITs. As a result, our non-traded Sponsored Companies may be unable to raise substantial funds which will limit the number and type of investments they may make and their ability to diversify their assets.\nIn March 2009, the Enforcement Division of FINRA commenced a review of broker-dealer sale and promotion activities of non-traded companies and in connection with the review, requested information from broker-dealers with respect to sales\npractices. Subsequent to that review, FINRA has announced that it filed a complaint against a broker-dealer firm, charging it with soliciting investors to purchase shares in a non-traded companies without conducting a reasonable investigation to determine whether it was suitable for those investors, and with providing misleading information on its website regarding distributions to investors. The disciplinary proceedings were settled in October 2012. Although the broker-dealer firm neither admitted nor denied the charges, the terms of the settlement required the broker-dealer firm to, among other things, pay approximately $12 million in restitution to certain investors and, in consultation with an independent consultant, make changes to its supervisory systems and training programs relating to the marketing of non-traded companies. A principal of the broker-dealer firm was also fined and suspended from the securities industry for practices related to marketing non-traded companies.\nIn February 2014, Apple REIT Six, Inc., Apple REIT Seven, Inc., Apple REIT Eight, Inc. and Apple REIT Nine, Inc., each of their external advisors and the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of each of the REITs entered into a cease and desist order with the SEC and agreed to pay approximately $1.5 million in civil fines in the aggregate. Although the respondents did not admit or deny any wrongdoing, the cease and desist order stated that the REITs made material misrepresentations regarding the valuation of the securities sold through their dividend reinvestment plans, had failed to maintain sufficient disclosure controls and procedures to meaningfully evaluate whether the value of the securities had changed, failed to disclose numerous related party transactions and failed to disclose significant compensation paid by the advisors to the REITs and by the founder to the executive officers of the REITs.\nThe above-referenced proceedings and related matters have resulted in increased regulatory scrutiny from the SEC, FINRA and state regulators regarding non-traded companies. Furthermore, amendments to FINRA rules regarding customer account statements have been approved by the SEC and will be effective on April 11, 2016, which may significantly affect the manner in which non-traded companies raise capital. These amendments may cause a significant reduction in capital raised by non-traded companies. In addition, the Obama administration has also proposed additional rules imposing fiduciary and other standards on sales practices of broker-dealers and the impact of any such rules, if adopted, although uncertain, could adversely affect the distribution of securities by our Sponsored Companies.\nAs a result of this increased scrutiny and accompanying negative publicity and coverage by media outlets, FINRA may impose additional restrictions on sales practices in the independent broker-dealer channel for non-traded companies, and accordingly the non-traded companies we manage may face increased difficulties in raising capital in their offerings. Should these companies be unable to raise substantial funds in their offerings, the number and type of investments they may make will be curtailed, all of which could materially adversely affect the fee income generated from our broker-dealer that acts as the dealer manager of these offerings as well as the asset management and other fees we earn and the nature of the transactions undertaken by the non-traded companies we manage which would adversely affect our ability to grow our business. If we or the non-traded companies we manage become the subject of scrutiny, even if we have complied with all applicable laws and regulations, responding to such scrutiny could be expensive, harmful to our reputation and distracting to our management.\nBecause there are numerous companies seeking to raise capital through non-traded companies, it may be more difficult for us to do so.\nWe intend to expand our business by managing additional non-traded companies, including NorthStar/RXR New York Metro, whose registration statement was declared effective by the SEC on February 9, 2015. In addition, NorthStar Corporate confidentially submitted a registration statement to the SEC. The number of entrants in the non-traded space has grown significantly over the last couple of years. Based on publicly-available information, as of February 26, 2015, there were 42 active non-traded companies in the marketplace and 11 others have filed registration statements, which are not yet effective. As a result, we will be subject to significant competition from these and other companies seeking to raise capital in the non-traded space. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors and raise capital through our non-traded companies. In addition, there can be no assurance that any non-traded companies we may sponsor or co-sponsor in the future will have their respective registration statement declared effective by the SEC or raise the maximum offering amounts as stated in the respective prospectus of such non-traded company.\nRisks Related to the Business of NorthStar Securities\nOur failure to maintain registration of NorthStar Securities as a broker-dealer member in the various jurisdictions in which we will do business, comply with applicable regulatory capital requirements and other interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nNorthStar Securities is a FINRA member wholesale broker-dealer that is registered in the various jurisdictions in which our Sponsored Companies do business. NorthStar Securities must comply with various regulatory guidelines to maintain its FINRA membership and continue to operate as a wholesale broker-dealer. There is no guarantee that FINRA, the SEC or the states or territories in which it is registered will not take action against NorthStar Securities to remove its membership and/or registrations. Even if NorthStar Securities has complied with applicable rules, it could still be subjected to investigation and scrutiny that could distract our management, force us to incur substantial cost and harm our brand. If NorthStar Securities has\nfailed to comply with applicable rules, it could be subject to enforcement actions and other penalties that could disrupt our business. Accordingly, such events would delay or potentially hinder sales of our Sponsored Companies\u2019 securities.\nNorthStar Securities is subject to various regulatory and capital requirements administered by the federal banking regulators. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, NorthStar Securities must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of its assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Its capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components of its capital, risk weightings of assets, off-balance sheet transactions, and other factors. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary, actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could harm either our operations and our financial condition.\nThere is no assurance NorthStar Securities will be able to successfully raise capital for NorthStar Healthcare, NorthStar Income II, NorthStar RXR/New York Metro or any other new entities we may manage or that it will be able to enter into any additional third-party selling agreements.\nNorthStar Securities may be unable to raise capital for NorthStar Healthcare, NorthStar Income II, NorthStar RXR/New York Metro or any other new entities that we may manage or co-manage, which would restrict our growth and harm our operations. We and NorthStar Securities have entered into, and will seek to enter into, additional third-party selling agreements in order to raise capital for our Sponsored Companies. There is no assurance, however, that we will be able to enter into additional third-party selling agreements on favorable terms, or at all, which would hinder or even cease our ability to raise capital for our Sponsored Companies. If our Sponsored Companies fail to fulfill their obligations under these agreements, our potential liability as a result of our indemnification obligations could materially adversely affect our business and performance. Additionally, significant declines in asset value and reductions in distributions in our Sponsored Companies could cause us to lose third-party selling agreements and limit our ability to sign future third-party selling agreements.\nRisks Relating to Ownership of our Common Stock\nThe market price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly for many reasons, including in response to the risk factors listed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or for reasons unrelated to our specific performance, such as investor perceptions, reports by industry analysts or negative developments with respect to us or our Managed Companies, as well as third parties. Our common stock could also be volatile as a result of speculation or general economic and industry conditions.\nOur distribution policy is subject to change and we may not be able to make distributions in the future.\nWe intend to make distributions to holders of our common stock on a quarterly basis. Evaluation of our distribution policy and the decision to make a distribution will be made solely at the discretion of our board of directors and will be based on factors including, but not limited to, CAD, our ability to generate income, availability of existing cash balances, the performance of our business, capital requirements, applicable law, access to cash in the capital markets and other financing sources, general economic conditions and economic conditions that more specifically impact our business or prospects and other factors our board of directors deems relevant.\nFuture distribution levels are subject to adjustment based upon any one or more of the factors set forth above, the risk factors set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or any other document we file with the SEC and other factors that our board of directors may, from time to time, deem relevant to consider when determining an appropriate common stock distribution. Our board of directors may also determine not to make any distribution.\nOur ability to make distributions is limited by the requirements of Delaware law.\nOur ability to make distributions on our common stock is limited by the laws of the State of Delaware, where we are incorporated. Under applicable Delaware law, a Delaware corporation may only declare and make a distribution out of its surplus or, in the event the corporation has no surplus, out of its net profits for the fiscal year in which the distribution is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year. Therefore, to the extent we do not have adequate surplus or net profits, we will be prohibited from making distributions.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our constituent documents and Delaware law might discourage or delay acquisition attempts for us that you might consider favorable.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of us more difficult without the approval of our board of directors. These provisions:\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance of undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and the shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval and which may include super voting, special approval, distribution or other rights or preferences superior to the rights of the holders of common stock;\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent, without the express prior consent of our board of directors;\n\u2022\nprovide that our board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws; and\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nThese anti-takeover provisions and other provisions under Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in our control, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions you desire. In addition, while we do not presently have a stockholder rights plan, we could adopt a stockholder rights plan in the future.\nFurthermore, in the event of a change of our control, we may be obligated to pay NorthStar Realty a cash amount in connection with performance-based equity awards issued by us under the terms of the management agreement, which could increase the costs and discourage a change in control.\nStockholders may experience substantial dilution.\nWe may undertake substantial offerings of our common stock and securities that are convertible into our common stock and may issue additional common stock in connection with acquisitions or joint ventures. If we engage in such transactions, our existing stockholders may experience immediate and substantial dilution in their percentage ownership of our outstanding common stock. Furthermore, stockholders may experience dilution in the value of their shares depending on the terms and pricing of any new stock issuances and the value of our assets at such time.\nStockholders have limited control over changes in our policies and operations, which increases the uncertainty and risks they face as stockholders.\nOur board of directors determines our major policies, including our policies regarding growth and distributions. Our board of directors may amend or revise these and other policies without a vote of our stockholders. We may change our investment or other policies without stockholder notice or consent, which could result in investments or activities that are different than, or in different proportion than, those described in this Annual Report. Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, or DGCL, and our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, stockholders have a right to vote only on limited matters. Our board of directors\u2019 broad discretion in setting policies and stockholders\u2019 inability to exert control over those policies increases the uncertainty and risks stockholders face.\nOur organizational documents do not limit our ability to enter into new lines of businesses and we may expand into new investment strategies, geographic markets and businesses, each of which may result in additional risks and uncertainties in our businesses.\nOur plan, to the extent that market conditions permit, is to grow our business and expand into new investment strategies, geographic markets and businesses. Our organizational documents do not limit us to the management of commercial real estate assets. Accordingly, we may pursue growth through acquisitions of asset management contracts or companies, acquisitions of critical business partners or other strategic initiatives. To the extent we make strategic investments or acquisitions, undertake other strategic initiatives or enter into a new line of business, we will face numerous risks and uncertainties, including risks associated with: (i) the required investment of capital and other resources; (ii) the possibility that we have insufficient expertise to engage in such activities profitably or without incurring inappropriate amounts of risk; (iii) combining or integrating operational and management systems and controls; and (iv) the broadening of our geographic footprint, including the risks associated with conducting operations in non-U.S. jurisdictions. Entry into certain lines of business may subject us to new laws and regulations with which we are not familiar, or from which we are currently exempt, and may lead to increased litigation and regulatory risk. If a new business generates insufficient revenues or if we are unable to efficiently manage our expanded operations, our results of operations will be adversely affected. Our strategic initiatives include joint ventures, which subject us to additional risks and uncertainties in that we are dependent upon, and subject to liability, losses or reputational damage relating to systems, controls and personnel that are not under our control. Any of these investments or initiatives could detract from management\u2019s time and resources and create greater potential for conflicts of interests.\nOur organizational documents designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur organizational documents provide that, subject to limited exceptions, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for: (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders; (iii) any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws; or (iv) any other action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the provisions of our constituent documents described above. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our constituent documents inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe reduced disclosure requirements applicable to us as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d may make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, and we may avail ourselves of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements of public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies,\u201d including, but not limited to, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirement of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We may remain an emerging growth company for up to five full fiscal years following the spin-off. We would cease to be an emerging growth company, and, therefore, become ineligible to rely on the above exemptions, if we have more than $1 billion in annual revenue in a fiscal year, if we issue more than $1 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period or on the date that we become a \u201clarge accelerated filer\u201d as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act which would occur after: (i) we have filed at least one annual report; (ii) we have been an SEC-reporting company for at least 12 months; and (iii) the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions.\nIf some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result of the exemptions available to us as an emerging growth company, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our value may be more volatile than that of an otherwise comparable company that does not avail itself of the same or similar exemptions.\nIf we are unable to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or our internal control over financial reporting is not effective, the reliability of our financial statements may be questioned and our stock price may suffer.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires any company subject to the reporting requirements of the U.S. securities laws to do a comprehensive evaluation of its and its consolidated subsidiaries\u2019 internal control over financial reporting. To comply with this statute, we are required to document and test our internal control procedures, our management is required to assess and issue a report concerning our internal control over financial reporting and our independent auditors are required to issue an opinion on their audit of our internal control over financial reporting. The rules governing the standards that must be met for management to assess our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation to meet the detailed standards under the rules. During the course of its testing, our management may identify material weaknesses or deficiencies which may not be remedied in time to meet the deadline imposed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. If our management cannot favorably assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting or our auditors identify material weaknesses in our internal controls, investor confidence in our financial results may weaken and our stock price may suffer. For instance, accounting irregularities recently discovered at various market participants have caused the SEC to launch an inquiry, stockholders initiate lawsuits, executives resign, the stock price to significantly decrease and the firm\u2019s reputation to be questioned by stockholders and the press.", "PERMNO": 14686, "SIC": 6211, "TIC": "NSAM"}
