{"cik": "884624", "company": "Orthofix Medical Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nIn addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report and the exhibits hereto, you should carefully consider the risks described below. These risks are not the only ones that we may face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also impair our business operations. This Annual Report also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including the risks faced by us described below or elsewhere in this Annual Report. Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk and if any of these risks or uncertainties occur, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nRisks Related to our Legal and Regulatory Environment\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls or discover material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately or detect fraud, which could harm our business and the trading price of our common stock.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important in our effort to prevent financial fraud. We are required to periodically evaluate the effectiveness of the design and operation of our internal controls. As has occurred in several years prior, these evaluations may result in the conclusion that enhancements, modifications, or changes to our internal controls are necessary or desirable. While management evaluates the effectiveness of our internal controls on a regular basis, these controls may not always be effective. There are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of internal controls, including collusion, management override, and failure of human judgment. Because of this, control procedures are designed to reduce rather than eliminate business risks. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls or if management or our independent registered public accounting firm were to discover material weaknesses in our internal controls, we may be unable to produce reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, which could harm our financial condition and operating results, and could result in a loss of investor confidence and a decline in our stock price.\nWe are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d) and other similar anti-bribery laws and any violations of such laws could subject us to adverse consequences.\nThe FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also imposes accounting standards and requirements on U.S. publicly traded entities and their foreign affiliates, which are intended to prevent the diversion of corporate funds to the payment of bribes and other improper payments. Because of the predominance of government-sponsored healthcare systems around the world, many of our customer relationships outside of the U.S. are with governmental entities and are therefore subject to such anti-bribery laws.\nAny failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory obligations in the U.S. or abroad could adversely affect us in a variety of ways that include, but are not limited to, significant criminal, civil, and administrative penalties, including imprisonment of individuals, fines and penalties, denial of export privileges, seizure of shipments, restrictions on certain business activities, disgorgement and other remedial measures, disruptions of our operations, and significant management distraction. Also, the failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory obligations could result in the disruption of our distribution and sales activities. Any reduction in international sales, or our failure to further develop our international markets, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to federal and state healthcare fraud, abuse, and anti-self-referral laws, and could face substantial penalties if we are determined not to have fully complied with such laws.\nHealthcare fraud and abuse regulations by federal and state governments impact our business. Healthcare fraud and abuse laws potentially applicable to our operations include:\n\u25cf\nThe federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program (such as the Medicare or Medicaid programs);\n\u25cf\nThe federal Stark law, which prohibits physician self-referral, specifically a referral by a physician of a Medicare or Medicaid patient to an entity providing designated health services if the physician or an immediate family member has a financial relationship with that entity;\n\u25cf\nFederal false claims laws, which prohibit, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal government payors that are false or fraudulent; and\n\u25cf\nState and non-U.S. laws analogous to each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws that may apply to items or services reimbursed by non-governmental or non-U.S. governmental third-party payors, including commercial insurers.\nDue to the breadth of some of these laws, there can be no assurance that we will not be found to be in violation of any such laws, and as a result we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring\nof our operations, or the exclusion from participation in federal, non-U.S., or state healthcare programs. Any penalties could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against them, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business.\nReimbursement policies of third parties, cost containment measures, and healthcare reform could adversely affect the demand for our products and limit our ability to sell our products.\nOur products are sold either directly by us or by independent sales representatives to customers or to our independent distributors and purchased by hospitals, healthcare providers, and patients. These products may be reimbursed by third-party payors, such as government programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, and Tricare, or private insurance plans and healthcare networks. Major third-party payors for medical services in the U.S. and internationally continue to work to contain health care costs and are increasingly challenging the policies and the prices charged for medical products and services. Any medical policy developments that eliminate, reduce, or materially modify coverage of our reimbursement rates for our products could have an impact on our ability to sell our products. In addition, third-party payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that a device or product provided to a patient or used in a procedure does not meet applicable payment criteria or if the policyholder\u2019s healthcare insurance benefits are limited. These policies and criteria may be revised from time-to-time.\nLimits put on reimbursement could make it more difficult to buy our products and substantially reduce, or possibly eliminate, patient access to our products. In addition, should governmental authorities continue to enact legislation or adopt regulations that affect third-party coverage and reimbursement, access to our products and coverage by private or public insurers may be reduced with a consequential material adverse effect on our sales and profitability.\nCMS, in its ongoing implementation of the Medicare program, periodically reviews medical study literature to determine how the literature addresses certain procedures and therapies in the Medicare population. The impact that this information could have on Medicare coverage policy for our products is currently unknown, but we cannot provide assurances that the resulting actions will not restrict Medicare coverage for our products. There can be no assurance that we or our distributors will not experience significant reimbursement problems in the future related to these or other proceedings. Globally, our products are sold in many countries, such as the U.K., Germany, France, and Italy, which have publicly funded healthcare systems. The ability of hospitals supported by such systems to purchase our products is dependent, in part, upon public budgetary constraints. Any increase in such constraints may have a material adverse effect on our sales and collection of accounts receivable from such sales.\nAs required by law, CMS has continued efforts to implement a competitive bidding program for selected DMEPOS items paid for by the Medicare program. In this program, Medicare rates are based on bid amounts for certain products in designated geographic areas, rather than the Medicare fee schedule amount. Bone growth stimulation products are currently exempt from this competitive bidding process. We cannot predict which products from any of our businesses may ultimately be affected or whether or when the competitive bidding process may be extended to our businesses. There can be no assurance that the implementation of the competitive bidding program will not have an adverse impact on the sales of some of our products.\nWe and certain of our suppliers may be subject to extensive government regulation that increases our costs and could limit our ability to market or sell our products.\nThe medical devices we manufacture and market are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA and numerous other federal, state, and foreign governmental authorities. These authorities regulate the development, approval, classification, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing, and sale of medical devices. Likewise, our use and disclosure of certain categories of health information may be subject to federal and state laws, implemented and enforced by governmental authorities that protect health information privacy and security. For a description of these regulations, see Item 1, \u201cBusiness,\u201d under the subheading \u201cGovernment Regulation.\u201d\nThe approval or clearance by governmental authorities, including the FDA in the U.S., is generally required before any medical devices may be marketed in the U.S. or other countries. We cannot predict whether, in the future, the U.S. or foreign governments may impose regulations that have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nThe process of obtaining FDA clearance and approvals to develop and market a medical device can be costly, time-consuming, and subject to the risk that such clearances or approvals will not be granted on a timely basis, if at all. The regulatory process may delay or prohibit the marketing of new products and impose substantial additional costs if the FDA lengthens review times for new devices. The FDA has the ability to change the regulatory classification of a cleared or approved device from a higher to a lower\nregulatory classification, or to reclassify an HCT/P, either of which could materially adversely impact our ability to market or sell our devices.\nIn addition, we may be subject to compliance actions, penalties, or injunctions if we are determined to be promoting the use of our products for unapproved or off-label uses, or if the FDA challenges one or more of our determinations that a product modification did not require new approval or clearance by the FDA. Device manufacturers are permitted to promote products solely for the uses and indications set forth in the approved product labeling. A number of enforcement actions have been taken against manufacturers that promote products for \u201coff-label\u201d uses, including actions alleging that federal health care program reimbursement of products promoted for \u201coff-label\u201d uses are false and fraudulent claims to the government. The failure to comply with \u201coff-label\u201d promotion restrictions can result in significant administrative obligations and costs, and potential penalties from, and/or agreements with, the federal government.\nWe and certain of our suppliers also are subject to announced and unannounced inspections by the FDA to determine our compliance with FDA\u2019s QSR and other regulations. If the FDA were to find that we or certain of our suppliers have failed to comply with applicable regulations, the agency could institute a wide variety of enforcement actions, ranging from a public warning letter to more severe sanctions such as fines and civil penalties against us, our officers, our employees, or our suppliers; unanticipated expenditures to address or defend such actions; delays in clearing or approving, or refusal to clear or approve, our products; withdrawal or suspension of approval of our products or those of our third-party suppliers by the FDA or other regulatory bodies; product recall or seizure; interruption of production; operating restrictions; injunctions; and criminal prosecution. The FDA also has the authority to request repair, replacement, or refund of the cost of any medical device manufactured or distributed by us. Any of the foregoing actions could have a material adverse effect on our development of new laboratory tests, business strategy, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nMoreover, governmental authorities outside the U.S. have become increasingly stringent in their regulation of medical devices, and our products may become subject to more rigorous regulation by non-U.S. governmental authorities in the future. U.S. or non-U.S. government regulations may be imposed in the future that may have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. The European Commission (\u201cEC\u201d) has harmonized national regulations for the control of medical devices through European Medical Device Directives with which manufacturers must comply. Under these new regulations, manufacturing plants must have received a full Quality Assurance Certification from a \u201cNotified Body\u201d in order to be able to sell products within the member states of the E.U. This Certification allows manufacturers to stamp the products of certified plants with a \u201cCE\u201d mark. Products covered by the EC regulations that do not bear the CE mark cannot be sold or distributed within the E.U. We have received certification for all currently existing manufacturing facilities.\nAn FDA panel recently recommended that bone growth stimulator devices be reclassified by the FDA from Class III to Class II devices, which could increase future competition for us in this product category and negatively affect our future sales of such products.\nWe have the market-leading bone growth stimulation platform with the only cervical spinal spine indication granted by the FDA, and the only mobile device app accessory designed to help patients adhere to their prescriptions and improve their clinical outcomes, STIM onTrack 2.1. We also are investing in IDE studies to expand indications for use in areas such as rotator cuff tears. Our bone growth therapy products currently are designated as Class III devices. Class III devices are subject to the FDA\u2019s most rigorous pathway to approval for medical devices in the U.S. The FDA may change classification of a device only if the proposed new class has sufficient regulatory controls to provide reasonable assurances of safety and effectiveness.\nIn September 2020, the FDA\u2019s Orthopaedic and Rehabilitation Devices Panel recommended that bone growth stimulator devices be reclassified from Class III to Class II devices with \u201cspecial controls\u201d to ensure patient safety and therapy efficacy. These proposed special controls include the condition that such devices be subject to rigorous clinical studies and post market surveillance for any new products. This would be in addition to other special controls and the Class II general requirement that any new products show \u201csubstantial equivalence\u201d to already-cleared or approved devices.\nWe believe that the panel\u2019s recommendation correctly recognizes the importance of PMA-like clinical data for these devices, so that manufacturers continue to be required to submit robust clinical data under the approval or clearance process to ensure the safety and efficacy of these devices for patients. We, along with other bone growth stimulation manufacturers, submitted comments in response to the FDA\u2019s proposed rulemaking to underscore the panel\u2019s recommendation of the need for robust clinical data prior to approval or clearance of bone growth stimulator products, together with post market surveillance requirements.\nIn the long-term, the recommended reclassification could enhance the ability of competitors to enter the market if they are able to create technologies with comparable efficacy to our devices, which could result in our products facing additional competition, thereby negatively affecting our future sales of these products.\nWe continue to be affected by U.S. healthcare reform initiatives.\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (or collectively the \u201cACA\u201d), has caused a number of substantial changes to occur in recent years in the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. The ACA is far-reaching and is intended to expand access to health insurance coverage, improve quality, and reduce costs over time. Among other things, the ACA:\n\u25cf\nEstablished a Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee and identify priorities in comparative clinical effectiveness research in an effort to coordinate and develop such research; and\n\u25cf\nImplemented payment system reforms including a national pilot program on payment bundling to encourage hospitals, physicians, and other providers to improve the coordination, quality, and efficiency of certain healthcare services through bundled payment models.\nU.S. government agencies continue efforts to modify provisions of the ACA. For example, CMS began permitting states to impose work requirements on persons covered by Medicaid expansion plans, certain federal subsidies to insurers have ended, and certain short-term insurance plans not offering the full array of ACA benefits have been allowed to extend in duration. Some of these changes are being challenged in U.S. courts and so their long-term impact remains uncertain. This changing federal landscape has both positive and negative impacts on the U.S. healthcare industry, with much remaining uncertain as to how various provisions of federal law, and potential modification or repeal of these laws, will ultimately affect the industry. Any future changes to the ACA or other such legislation, depending on their nature, could have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain or increase sales of any of our products and achieve profitability.\nWe are subject to differing customs and import/export rules in several jurisdictions in which we operate.\nWe import and export our products to and from a number of different countries around the world. These product movements involve subsidiaries and third parties operating in jurisdictions with different customs and import/export rules and regulations. Customs authorities in such jurisdictions may challenge our treatment of customs and import/export rules relating to product shipments under aspects of their respective customs laws and treaties. If we are unsuccessful in defending our treatment of customs and import/export classifications, we may be subject to additional customs duties, fines, or penalties that could adversely affect our profitability.\nIn addition, changes in U.S. or foreign policies regarding international trade could also negatively impact our business. The enactment of or increases in tariffs, or other such charges, on specific products that we sell or with which our products compete, may have an adverse effect on our business or on our results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Business and Industry\nThe novel coronavirus pandemic has materially affected our business and may cause further unpredictable effects in the future.\nThe novel coronavirus discovered in late 2019, and the disease it causes, known as COVID-19, has negatively affected our business since March 2020 and may cause continuing negative effects in 2021 and beyond. For Orthofix, the most significant effect to date on our business has been a significant reduction in elective surgery procedure volumes, which represent the majority of procedures in which our products are used. This reduction in procedure volumes began suddenly in March 2020 when shelter in place and social distancing instructions were instituted in the U.S. and many of our other sales markets, which caused a pronounced reduction in revenue during April 2020 and May 2020, when a significant number of hospitals were either closed for elective procedures or otherwise operating at significantly reduced volumes. Generally, this reduction in procedure volumes dissipated during June 2020 and July 2020, as many regions were able to reopen for elective procedures, with an existing patient backlog. At the present time, volumes have fluctuated as infection rates and hospitalizations have increased, and we may continue to experience significant decreases in procedure volumes if hospitals and other healthcare providers take similar precautionary measures in the future.\nThe future trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic remains uncertain, both in the U.S. and in other markets. Following the recent winter increase of cases, case counts have been declining in most markets in the weeks preceding this filing. In addition, several\nvaccines have been approved, and the number of people being vaccinated has been steadily increasing in recent weeks. However, new variants of the virus have emerged recently, and it is unclear the extent to which approved vaccines will work on these new variants, or how soon vaccines can be updated to account for such variants.\nGiven these various uncertainties, it is unclear the extent to which lingering slowdowns in elective procedures will continue to affect our business in 2021 and beyond. We expect that the effects of COVID-19 on our business will depend on various factors including (i) the magnitude and length of additional case waves, (ii) the distribution, efficacy, and public acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines, (iii) the comfort level of patients in returning to clinics and hospitals, (iv) the extent to which localized elective surgery shutdowns occur, (v) the unemployment rate\u2019s effect on potential patients lacking medical insurance coverage, and (vi) general hospital capacity constraints occurring because of the need to treat COVID-19 patients.\nThroughout 2020 we have focused on making our facilities safe given updated COVID-19 public health guidelines, and we believe that our employee workforce has done excellent work in adapting to the new environment. In particular, we have been able to continue our manufacturing activities to keep pace with customer orders. However, given the potential for further shelter in place orders in our largest manufacturing and operational centers (particularly, Lewisville, Texas and Verona, Italy), there remains a risk that a significant localized surge in the virus could cause disruption to our manufacturing, distribution, administrative, and other business operations (including downtime at our manufacturing facilities and the interruption of the production of our products).\nIn addition, while we have not seen such effects to date, risk remains that COVID-19 could have material negative effects on contractual counterparties, leading to supply chain disruptions or counterparty payment defaults and bankruptcies (including bankruptcies to hospital systems that significantly rely on revenue from elective surgeries).\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described herein, such as our need to generate sufficient cash flows to service indebtedness and our ability to protect our information technology networks and infrastructure from unauthorized access, misuse, malware, phishing and other events that could have a security impact as a result of our remote working environment or otherwise.\nAll of these factors, collectively, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business may be adversely affected if consolidation in the healthcare industry leads to demand for price concessions or if a group purchasing organization (\u201cGPO\u201d) or similar entity excludes us from being a supplier.\nBecause healthcare costs have risen significantly over the past decade, numerous initiatives and reforms have been launched by legislators, regulators, and third-party payors to curb these costs. As a result, there has been a consolidation trend in the healthcare industry to create larger companies, including medical device companies and hospitals, each with greater market power. As the healthcare industry consolidates, competition to provide products and services to industry participants has become and may continue to become more intense. This has resulted and may continue to result in greater pricing pressures and the exclusion of certain suppliers from important markets as GPOs, independent delivery networks, and large single accounts continue to use their market power to consolidate purchasing decisions and as larger manufacturers use their broad offerings to secure exclusive arrangements. If a GPO were to exclude us from their supplier list, our net sales could be adversely impacted. We expect that market demand, government regulation, third-party reimbursement policies, and societal pressures will continue to change the worldwide healthcare industry, which may exert further downward pressure on the prices of our products.\nThe industry in which we operate is highly competitive. New developments by others could make our products or technologies non-competitive or obsolete.\nThe medical devices industry is highly competitive. We compete with a large number of companies, many of which have significantly greater financial, manufacturing, marketing, distribution, and technical resources than we do. Many of our competitors may be able to develop products and processes competitive with, or superior to, our own. Furthermore, we may not be able to successfully develop or introduce new products that are less costly or offer better performance than those of our competitors, or offer purchasers of our products payment and other commercial terms as favorable as those offered by our competitors. For more information regarding our competitors, see Item 1, \u201cBusiness,\u201d under the subheading \u201cCompetition.\u201d\nIn addition, the orthopedic medical device industry in which we compete is undergoing, and is characterized by, rapid and significant technological change. We expect competition to intensify as technological advances are made. New technologies and products\ndeveloped by other companies are regularly introduced into the market, which may render our products or technologies non-competitive or obsolete.\nOur ability to market products successfully depends, in part, upon the acceptance of the products not only by consumers, but also by independent third parties.\nOur ability to market our products successfully depends, in part, on the acceptance of the products by independent third parties (including hospitals, physicians, other healthcare providers, and third-party payors) as well as patients. Unanticipated side effects or unfavorable publicity concerning any of our products could have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain hospital approvals or achieve acceptance by prescribing physicians, managed care providers and other retailers, customers, and patients.\nOur allograft and cellular bone allografts could expose us to certain risks that could disrupt our business.\nOur Biologics business markets allograft tissues that are derived from human cadaveric donors, and our ability to market the tissues depends on our supplier continuing to have access to donated human cadaveric tissue, as well as the maintenance of high standards by the supplier in its processing methodology. The supply of such donors is inherently unpredictable and can fluctuate over time. The allograft tissues are regulated under the FDA\u2019s HCT/P regulatory paradigm and not as a medical device, biologic, or drug. There can be no assurance that the FDA will not at some future date re-classify the allograft tissues, and the reclassification of this product from a human tissue to a medical device could have adverse consequences for us or for the supplier of this product and make it more difficult or expensive for us to conduct this business by requiring premarket clearance or approval, as well as compliance with additional post-market regulatory requirements.\nWe may not be able to successfully introduce new products to the market and market opportunities that we expect to develop for our products may not be as large as we expect.\nWe plan to continue to make improvements in our products, to develop new products, and to introduce our products into new markets. Despite our planning, the process of developing and introducing new products (including product enhancements) is inherently complex and uncertain, and involves risks, including the ability of such new products to satisfy customer needs, gain broad market acceptance (including by physicians), and obtain regulatory approvals. These events can depend on the product achieving broad clinical acceptance, the level of third-party reimbursement, and the introduction of competing technologies, among other things. In addition, these risks make it inherently difficult to forecast and predict the future net sales of our products. If the market opportunities that we expect to develop for our products, including new products, are not as large as we expect, it could adversely affect our ability to grow our business.\nGrowing our business requires that we properly educate and train physicians regarding the distinctive characteristics, benefits, safety, clinical efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of our products.\nAcceptance of our products depends in part on our ability to (i) educate the medical community as to the distinctive characteristics, benefits, safety, clinical efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of our products compared to alternative products, procedures, and therapies, and (ii) train physicians in the proper use and implementation of our products. This is particularly true in instances of newly launched products or in the introduction of a product into a new market, such as our launch of the M6-C artificial cervical disc within the U.S. We support our sales force and distributors through specialized training workshops in which surgeons and sales specialists participate. We also produce marketing materials, including materials outlining surgical procedures, for our sales force and distributors in a variety of languages using printed, video, and multimedia formats. To provide additional advanced training for surgeons, consistent with the AdvaMed Code and the MedTech Code, we organize regular multilingual teaching seminars in multiple locations. However, we may not be successful in our efforts to educate the medical community and properly train physicians. If physicians are not properly trained, they may misuse or ineffectively use our products, which may result in unsatisfactory patient outcomes, patient injury, negative publicity, or lawsuits against us. In addition, a failure to educate the medical community regarding our products may impair our ability to achieve market acceptance of our products.\nWe may be adversely affected by any disruption in our information technology systems, which could adversely affect our cash flows, operating results, and financial condition.\nOur operations are dependent upon our information technology systems, which encompass all of our major business functions. We rely upon such information technology systems to manage and replenish inventory, to fill and ship customer orders on a timely basis, to coordinate our sales activities across all of our products and services, and to coordinate our administrative activities. A\nsubstantial disruption in our information technology systems for any prolonged time period (arising from, for example, system capacity limits from unexpected increases in our volume of business, outages, or delays in our service) could result in delays in receiving inventory and supplies or filling customer orders and adversely affect our customer service and relationships. Our systems might be damaged or interrupted by natural or man-made events, or by computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, and similar disruptions affecting the global internet. There can be no assurance that such delays, problems, or costs will not have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, operating results, and financial condition.\nAs our operations grow in both size and scope, we will continuously need to improve and upgrade our systems and infrastructure while maintaining the reliability and integrity of our systems and infrastructure. An expansion of our systems and infrastructure may require us to commit substantial financial, operational, and technical resources before the volume of our business increases, with no assurance that the volume of business will increase. Any such upgrades to our systems and information technology, or new technology, now and in the future, require that our management and resources be diverted from our core business to assist in compliance with those requirements. There can be no assurance that the time and resources our management will need to devote to these upgrades, service outages, or delays due to the installation of any new or upgraded technology (and customer issues therewith), or the impact on the reliability of our data from any new or upgraded technology, will not have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, operating results, and financial condition.\nA significant portion of our operations run on a single Enterprise Resource Planning (\u201cERP\u201d) platform. To manage our international operations efficiently and effectively, we rely heavily on our ERP system, internal electronic information and communications systems, and on systems or support services from third parties. Any of these systems are subject to electrical or telecommunications outages, computer hacking, or other general system failure. It is also possible that future acquisitions will operate on different ERP systems and that we could face difficulties in integrating operational and accounting functions of new acquisitions. Difficulties in upgrading or expanding our ERP system or system-wide or local failures that affect our information processing could adversely affect our cash flows, operating results, and financial condition.\nWe may be adversely affected by a failure or compromise from a cyberattack or data breach, which could have an adverse effect on our business\nWe rely on information technology systems to perform our business operations, including processing, transmitting, and storing electronic information, and interacting with customers, suppliers, healthcare payors, and other third parties. Like other medical device companies, the size and complexity of our information technology systems makes them vulnerable to a cyber-attack, malicious intrusion, breakdown, destruction, loss of data privacy, or other significant disruption. Our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect, and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving systems and regulatory standards, the increasing need to protect financial or personal information related to patients and customers, and changing customer patterns.\nFor example, third parties may attempt to hack into our products to obtain data relating to patients, to disrupt performance of our products, or to access our proprietary information. Any failure by us to maintain or protect our information technology systems and data integrity, including from cyber-attacks, intrusions, or other breaches, could result in the unauthorized access to patient data and personally identifiable information, theft of intellectual property, or other misappropriation of assets, or otherwise compromise our confidential or proprietary information and disrupt our operations. In the U.S., Federal and State privacy and security laws require certain of our operations to protect the confidentiality of personal information including patient medical records and other health information. In Europe, the Data Protection Directive requires us to manage individually identifiable information in the E.U. and, the GDPR may impose fines of up to four percent of our global revenue in the event of violations. Internationally, some countries have also passed laws that require individually identifiable data on their citizens to be maintained on local servers and that may restrict transfer or processing of that data. We believe that we meet the expectations of applicable regulations and that the ongoing costs of compliance with such rules are not material to our business but could become material due to new regulations. There is no guarantee that we will be able to comply with these regulations, or otherwise avoid the negative reputational and other affects that might ensue from a significant data breach or failure to comply with applicable data privacy regulations, each of which could have significant adverse effects on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nIn recent years, companies around the world are seeing a surge in wire transfer \u201cphishing\u201d attacks that attempt to trick employees into wiring money from company bank accounts to criminals\u2019 bank accounts. In some cases, companies have lost millions of dollars to such relatively simple attacks, and these funds often are not recovered. While we take efforts to train employees to be cognizant of these types of attacks and take appropriate precautions, the level of technological sophistication being used by attackers has increased in recent years and a successful attack against us could lead to the loss of significant funds.\nWe are dependent on third-party manufacturers for many of our products.\nWe contract with third-party manufacturers to produce many of our products like many other companies in the medical device industry. If we or any such manufacturer fail to meet production and delivery schedules, it can have an adverse impact on our ability to sell such products. Further, whether we directly manufacture a product or utilize a third-party manufacturer, shortages and spoilage of materials, labor stoppages, product recalls, manufacturing defects, and other similar events can delay production and inhibit our ability to bring a new product to market in timely fashion. For example, the supply of the Trinity ELITE and Trinity Evolution allografts are derived from human cadaveric donors, and our ability to market the tissues depends on MTF continuing to have access to donated human cadaveric tissue and their continued maintenance of high standards in their processing methodology.\nTermination of our existing relationships with our independent sales representatives or distributors could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe sell our products in many countries through independent distributors. Frequently, our independent sales representatives and our distributors have the exclusive right to sell our products in their respective territories. The terms of these agreements vary in length, generally from one to ten years. Under the terms of our standard distribution agreements, each party has the right to terminate in the event of a material breach by the other party and we generally have the right to terminate if the distributor does not meet agreed sales targets or fails to make payments on time. Any termination of our existing relationships with independent sales representatives or distributors could have an adverse effect on our business unless and until commercially acceptable alternative distribution arrangements are put in place. In addition, we operate in areas of the world that have been or may be disproportionately affected by recessions or disasters and we bear risk that existing or future accounts receivable may be uncollected if these distributors or hospitals experience disruptions to their business that cause them to discontinue paying ongoing accounts payable or become insolvent.\nWe depend on our senior management team.\nOur success depends upon the skill, experience, and performance of members of our senior management team, who have been critical to the management of our operations and the implementation of our business strategy. We do not have key man insurance on our senior management team, and the loss of one or more key executive officers could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Further, any turnover in our senior management team could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows.\nIn order to compete, we must attract, retain, and motivate key employees, and our failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIn order to compete, we must attract, retain, and motivate executives and other key employees, including those in managerial, technical, sales, marketing, research, development, finance, information and technology, and other support positions. Hiring and retaining qualified executives, engineers, technical staff, and sales representatives is critical to our business, and competition for experienced employees in the medical device industry can be intense. To attract, retain, and motivate qualified executives and key employees, we utilize stock-based incentive awards, such as employee stock options, and restricted stock units. Certain awards vest based upon the passage of time while others vest upon the achievement of certain performance-based or market-based conditions. If the value of such stock awards does not appreciate, as measured by the performance of the price of our common stock, and ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit, our ability to attract, retain, and motivate our employees could be adversely impacted, which could negatively affect our results of operations and/or require us to increase the amount we expend on cash and other forms of compensation.\nOur business is subject to economic, political, regulatory, and other risks associated with international sales and operations.\nBecause we sell our products in many different countries, our business is subject to risks associated with conducting business internationally. We anticipate that net sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total net sales. In addition, certain of our manufacturing facilities and suppliers are located outside the U.S. Accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022\nChanges in a specific country\u2019s or region\u2019s political or economic conditions;\n\u2022\nTrade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements or other restrictive actions by foreign governments;\n\u2022\nTariff increases and import or export restrictions\n\u2022\nConsequences from changes in tax or customs laws;\n\u2022\nDifficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations;\n\u2022\nDiffering labor regulations;\n\u2022\nDiffering protection of intellectual property;\n\u2022\nUnexpected changes in regulatory requirements; and\n\u2022\nViolation by our independent agents of the FCPA or other anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws.\nRisks Related to our Intellectual Property\nWe depend on our ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights, but we may not be able to maintain the confidentiality of these assets or assure their protection.\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to protect our current and future technologies and products and to defend our intellectual property rights. If we fail to protect our intellectual property adequately, competitors may manufacture and market products that are similar to, or that compete directly with, our products. Numerous patents covering our technologies have been issued to us and we have filed, and expect to continue to file, patent applications seeking to protect newly developed technologies and products in various countries, including the U.S. Some patent applications in the U.S. are maintained in secrecy until the patent is issued. Because the publication of discoveries tends to follow their actual discovery by several months, we may not be the first to invent or file patent applications on any of our discoveries. Patents may not be issued with respect to any of our patent applications and existing or future patents issued to or licensed by us and may not provide adequate protection or competitive advantages for our products. Patents that are issued may be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented by our competitors. Furthermore, our patent rights may not prevent our competitors from developing, using, or commercializing products that are similar or functionally equivalent to our products.\nWe also rely on trade secrets, unpatented proprietary expertise, and continuing technological innovation that we protect, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with assignors, licensees, suppliers, employees, and consultants. These agreements may be breached and there may not be adequate remedies in the event of a breach. Disputes may arise concerning the ownership of intellectual property or the applicability or enforceability of confidentiality agreements. Moreover, our trade secrets and proprietary technology may otherwise become known or be independently developed by our competitors. If patents are not issued with respect to our products arising from research, we may not be able to maintain the confidentiality of information relating to these products. In addition, if a patent relating to any of our products lapses or is invalidated, we may experience greater competition arising from new market entrants.\nThird parties may claim that we infringe on their proprietary rights and may prevent us from manufacturing and selling certain of our products.\nThere has been substantial litigation in the medical device industry with respect to the manufacture, use, and sale of new products. These lawsuits relate to the validity and infringement of patents or proprietary rights of third parties. We may be required to defend against allegations relating to the infringement of patent or proprietary rights of third parties. Any such litigation could, among other things:\n\u2022\nRequire us to incur substantial expense, even if we are successful in the litigation;\n\u2022\nRequire us to divert significant time and effort of our technical and management personnel;\n\u2022\nResult in the loss of our rights to develop or make certain products; and\n\u2022\nRequire us to pay substantial monetary damages or royalties in order to license proprietary rights from third parties or to satisfy judgments or to settle actual or threatened litigation.\nAlthough patent and intellectual property disputes within the orthopedic medical devices industry have often been settled through assignments, licensing, or similar arrangements, costs associated with these arrangements may be substantial and could include the long-term payment of royalties. Furthermore, the required assignments or licenses may not be made available to us on acceptable terms. Accordingly, an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding, or a failure to obtain necessary assignments or licenses, could prevent us from manufacturing and selling some products or increase our costs to market these products.\nRisks Related to Litigation and Product Liability Matters\nWe may be subject to product and other liability claims that may not be covered by insurance and could require us to pay substantial sums. Moreover, fluctuations in insurance expense could adversely affect our profitability.\nWe are subject to an inherent risk of, and adverse publicity associated with, product liability and other liability claims, whether or not such claims are valid. We maintain product liability insurance coverage in amounts and scope that we believe are reasonable and adequate. There can be no assurance, however, that product liability or other claims will not exceed our insurance coverage limits or that such insurance will continue to be available on reasonable, commercially acceptable terms, or at all. A successful product liability claim that exceeds our insurance coverage limits could require us to pay substantial sums and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nIn addition to product liability insurance coverage, we hold a number of other insurance policies, including directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance, property insurance, and workers\u2019 compensation insurance. If the costs of maintaining adequate insurance coverage should increase significantly in the future, our operating results could be materially adversely impacted.\nRisks Related to Potential Acquisitions, Investments, and Divestitures\nOur efforts to identify, pursue, and implement new business opportunities (including acquisitions) may be unsuccessful and may have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur growth depends, in large part, on our ability to identify, pursue, and implement new business opportunities that expand our product offerings, capabilities, and geographic presence, and we compete with other medical device companies for these opportunities. Our efforts to identify such opportunities focus primarily on potential acquisitions of new businesses, products or technologies, licensing arrangements, commercialization arrangements, and other transactions with third parties. We may not be able to identify business opportunities that meet our strategic criteria or that are acceptable to us or our shareholders. Even if we are able to identify acceptable business opportunities, we may not be able to pursue or implement such business opportunities (or, in the case of acquisitions or other transactions, complete such acquisitions or other transactions) in a timely manner or on a cost-effective basis (or at all), and we may not realize the expected benefits of such business opportunities. If we are not able to identify, pursue, and implement new business opportunities, it will adversely affect our ability to grow our business.\nIn addition, pursuing and implementing new business opportunities (particularly acquisitions) may involve significant costs and entail risks, uncertainties, and disruptions to our business, especially where we have limited experience as a company developing or marketing a particular product or technology or operating in a particular geographic region. We may be unable to integrate a new business, product, or technology effectively, or we may incur significant charges related to an acquisition or other business opportunity (for example, amortization of acquired assets or asset impairment charges), which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Newly acquired technology or products may require additional development efforts prior to commercial sale, including clinical testing and approval by the FDA and applicable foreign regulatory authorities; such additional development efforts may involve significant expense and ultimately be unsuccessful. Any cross-border acquisitions or transactions may involve unique risks in addition to those mentioned above, including those related to integration of operations across different cultures and languages, currency risks, and the particular economic, political, and regulatory risks associated with specific countries. To the extent we issue additional equity in connection with acquisitions, this may dilute our existing shareholders.\nWe have provided $10.0 million in investments and loans to a privately-held company in Switzerland and may not be able to recoup our investment.\nIn October 2020, we entered into agreements with Neo Medical SA, a privately-held Swiss-based medical technology company developing a new generation of products for spinal surgery (\u201cNeo Medical\u201d). Our collaboration with Neo Medical focuses on co-developing with them a cervical platform and deploying single-use, sterile-packed procedure solutions designed to increase operating room efficiencies, reduce procedural times and costs, improve patient outcomes through novel device designs and techniques, and reduce infection rates. These instruments are designed for surgical settings including acute care hospitals, outpatient hospitals and also ambulatory surgery centers. Under our agreements with Neo Medical, we will also exclusively distribute Neo Medical\u2019s thoracolumbar procedure solutions to certain U.S. accounts.\nIn connection with these arrangements, we purchased $5.0 million of Neo Medical\u2019s preferred stock, and loaned CHF 4.6 million ($5.0 million as of the issuance date) to Neo Medical pursuant to a convertible loan agreement. The loan accrues interest at an\nannual rate of 8% and is convertible by either party into additional shares of Neo Medical\u2019s preferred stock. If not otherwise converted to preferred stock in the interim, the loan and all accrued interest become due and payable in October 2024.\nNeo Medical is using the proceeds of our preferred stock purchase and loan to fund its ongoing operations. However, no assurance can be made that Neo Medical\u2019s business ultimately will be successful. As such, we could ultimately be unable to recoup any value for the preferred stock that we purchased and/or unable to recoup the amount of our loan.\nWe may incur significant costs or retain liabilities associated with disposition activity.\nWe may from time to time sell, license, assign, or otherwise dispose of or divest assets, the stock of subsidiaries, or individual products, product lines or technologies, which we determine are no longer desirable for us to own, some of which may be material. Any such activity could result in us incurring costs and expenses from these efforts, some of which could be significant. This may also result in us retaining liabilities related to the assets or properties disposed of even though, for instance, the income-generating assets have been disposed. These costs and expenses may be incurred at any time and may have a material impact on our results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Results and Need for Financing\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate.\nOur quarterly operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past. Our future quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly and we may experience losses depending on a number of factors, including the extent to which our products continue to gain or maintain market acceptance, the rate and size of expenditures incurred as we expand and/or establish our sales and distribution networks in certain domestic and international markets, the timing and level of reimbursement for our products by third-party payors, the extent to which we are subject to government regulation or enforcement, the valuation of certain assets and liabilities, and other factors, many of which are outside our control.\nWe face risks related to foreign currency exchange rates.\nBecause some of our revenue, operating expenses, assets, and liabilities are denominated in foreign currencies, we are subject to foreign exchange risks that could adversely affect our operations and reported results. To the extent that we incur expenses or recognize net sales in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, any change in the values of those foreign currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar could cause our profits to decrease or our products to be less competitive against those of our competitors. To the extent that our current assets denominated in foreign currency are greater or less than our current liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, we have potential foreign exchange exposure. The fluctuations of foreign exchange rates during 2020 had a favorable impact of $1.0 million on net sales outside of the U.S. Although we seek to manage our foreign currency exposure by matching non-dollar revenues and expenses, exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the future. To minimize such exposures, we may enter into currency hedges from time to time.\nOur global operations may expose us to tax risks\nWe are subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment and interpretation of tax laws are required to estimate our tax liabilities. Tax laws and rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change as a result of political and economic conditions. Our effective income tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in those tax laws, changes in the mix of earnings among tax jurisdictions, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and the resolution of matters arising from tax audits.\nCertain of our subsidiaries sell products directly to other Orthofix subsidiaries or provide marketing and support services to other Orthofix subsidiaries. These intercompany sales and support services involve subsidiaries operating in jurisdictions with differing tax rates and we must determine the appropriate allocation of income to each jurisdiction based on current interpretations of complex income tax regulations. Tax authorities in these jurisdictions may challenge our treatment of such intercompany transactions. If we are unsuccessful in defending our treatment of intercompany transactions, we may be subject to additional tax liability, interest, or penalty, which could adversely affect our profitability.\nWe maintain a $300.0 million secured revolving credit facility secured by a pledge of substantially all of our property.\nIn October 2019, we and certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively, the \u201cBorrowers\u201d) entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the \u201cAmended Credit Agreement\u201d). The Amended Credit Agreement provides for a $300.0 million secured revolving credit facility maturing on October 25, 2024, and amends and restates the previous $125.0 million secured revolving credit facility. No amount is currently outstanding on the credit facility as of December 31, 2020 or as of the date hereof, but the Company may draw on this facility in the future.\nCertain of our subsidiaries (collectively, the \u201cGuarantors\u201d) are required to guarantee the repayment of any obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement. The obligations with respect to the Amended Credit Agreement are secured by a pledge of substantially all of the personal property assets of the Borrowers and each of the Guarantors, including accounts receivables, deposit accounts, intellectual property, investment property, inventory, equipment, and equity interests in their respective subsidiaries.\nThe Amended Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, grant or permit additional liens, make investments and acquisitions, merge or consolidate with others, dispose of assets, pay dividends and distributions, pay subordinated indebtedness, and enter into affiliate transactions. In addition, the Amended Credit Agreement contains financial covenants requiring us to maintain, on a consolidated basis as of the last day of any fiscal quarter, a total net leverage ratio of not more than 3.5 to 1.0 (which ratio can be permitted to increase to 4.0 to 1.0 for no more than 4 fiscal quarters following a material acquisition) and an interest coverage ratio of at least 3.0 to 1.0. The Amended Credit Agreement also includes events of default customary for facilities of this type and upon the occurrence of such events of default, subject to customary cure rights, all outstanding loans under the Facility may be accelerated and/or the lenders\u2019 commitments terminated.\nWe believe that we are in compliance with the covenants, and there were no events of default, at December 31, 2020 (and in prior periods). However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet such financial covenants in future fiscal quarters. The failure to do so could result in an event of default under such agreement, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position in the event that we have significant amounts drawn under the facility at such time.", "PERMNO": 78756, "SIC": 3841, "TIC": "OFIX"}
