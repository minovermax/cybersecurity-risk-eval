{"cik": "32689", "company": "EMPIRE DISTRICT ELECTRIC CO", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-20", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nInvestors should review carefully the following risk factors and the other information contained in this Form 10-K. The risks we face are not limited to those in this section. There may be additional risks and uncertainties (either currently unknown or not currently believed to be material) that could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nReaders are cautioned that the risks and uncertainties described in this Form 10-K are not the only ones facing Empire. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are not presently aware of, or that we currently consider immaterial, may also affect our business operations. Our business, financial condition or results of operations (including our ability to pay dividends on our common stock) could suffer if the concerns set forth below are realized.\nWe are exposed to increases in costs and reductions in revenue which we cannot control and which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe primary drivers of our electric operating margins in any period are: (1) rates we can charge our customers, including timing of new rates, (2) weather, (3) customer growth and usage and (4) general economic conditions. Of the factors driving margins, weather has the greatest short-term effect on the demand for electricity for our regulated business. Mild weather reduces demand and, as a result, our electric operating revenues. In addition, changes in customer demand due to downturns in the economy, energy efficiency or increased use of self-generation and distributed energy technologies could reduce our revenues.\nThe primary drivers of our electric operating expenses in any period are: (1) fuel and purchased power expenses, (2) operating, maintenance and repairs expense, including repairs following severe weather and plant outages, (3) taxes and (4) non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization expense. Although we generally recover these expenses through our rates, there can be no assurance that we will recover all, or any part of, such increased costs in future rate cases.\nThe primary drivers of our gas operating revenues in any period are: (1) rates we can charge our customers, (2) weather, (3) customer growth, (4) the cost of natural gas and interstate pipeline transportation charges and (5) general economic conditions. Because natural gas is heavily used for residential and commercial heating, the demand for this product depends heavily upon weather patterns throughout our natural gas service territory and a significant amount of our natural gas revenues are recognized in the first and fourth quarters related to the heating seasons. Accordingly, our natural gas operations have historically generated less revenues and income when weather conditions are warmer in the winter.\nThe primary driver of our gas operating expense in any period is the price of natural gas.\nSignificant increases in electric and gas operating expenses or reductions in electric and gas operating revenues may occur and result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEnergy conservation, energy efficiency, distributed generation and other factors that reduce energy demand could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRegulatory and legislative bodies have proposed or introduced requirements and incentives to reduce energy consumption. Conservation and energy efficiency programs are designed to reduce energy demand. Unless there is a regulatory solution ensuring recovery, declining usage will result in an under-recovery of our fixed costs. Macroeconomic factors resulting in low economic growth or contraction within our service territories could also reduce energy demand. Any such reductions in energy demand could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations\nIn addition, significant technological advancements are taking place in the electric industry, including advancements related to self-generation and distributed energy technologies such as fuel cells, micro turbines, wind turbines and solar cells. Adoption of these technologies may increase because of advancements or government subsidies reducing the cost of generating electricity through these technologies to a level that is competitive with our current methods of generating electricity. There is also a perception that generating electricity through these technologies is more environmentally friendly than generating electricity with fossil fuels. Increased adoption of these technologies would reduce demand for our electricity but would not necessarily reduce our investment and operating requirements due to our obligation to serve customers, including those self-generation customers whose equipment has failed for any reason to provide the power they need. In addition, self-generating customers do not currently pay a share of the costs necessary to operate our transmission and distribution system. As a result, the pool of customers from whom fixed costs are recovered would be reduced, potentially resulting in under-recovery of our fixed costs and upward price pressure on our remaining customers. If we were unable to adjust our prices to reflect such reduced electricity demand and any related use of net energy metering (which allows self-generating customers to receive bill credits for surplus power), our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, since a portion of our costs are recovered through charges based upon the volume of power delivered, reductions in electricity deliveries will affect the timing of our recovery of those costs and may require changes to our rate structures.\nWe are subject to environmental laws and the incurrence of environmental liabilities which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to extensive federal, state and local regulation with regard to air and other environmental matters. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. In addition, new environmental laws and regulations, and new interpretations of existing environmental laws and regulations, have been adopted and may in the future be adopted which may substantially increase our future environmental expenditures for both new facilities and our existing facilities. Compliance with current and potential future air emission standards (such as those limiting emission levels of sulfur dioxide (SO2), emissions of mercury, other hazardous pollutants (HAPS), nitrogen oxide (NOx), and carbon dioxide (CO2)) has required, and may in the future require, significant environmental expenditures. Although we have historically recovered such costs through our rates, there can be no assurance that we will recover all, or any part of, such increased costs in future rate cases. The incurrence of additional material environmental costs which are not recovered in our rates may result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are exposed to factors that can increase our fuel and purchased power expenditures, including disruption in deliveries of coal or natural gas, decreased output from our power plants, failure of performance by purchased power counterparties and market risk in our fuel procurement strategy.\nFuel and purchased power costs are our largest expenditures. Increases in the price of coal, natural gas or the cost of purchased power will result in increased electric operating expenditures. Given we have a fuel cost recovery mechanism in all of our jurisdictions, our net income exposure to the impact of the risks discussed above is significantly reduced. However, cash flow could still be impacted by these increased expenditures. We are also subject to prudency reviews which could negatively impact our net income if a regulatory commission would conclude our costs were incurred imprudently.\nWe depend upon regular deliveries of coal as fuel for our Asbury, Iatan and Plum Point plants. Substantially all of this coal comes from mines in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming and is delivered to the plants by train. Production problems in these mines, railroad transportation or congestion problems, or unavailability of trains could affect delivery cycle times required to maintain plant inventory levels, causing us to implement coal conservation and supply replacement measures to retain adequate reserve inventories at our facilities. These measures could include some or all of the following: reducing the output of our coal plants, increasing the utilization of our gas-fired generation facilities, purchasing power from other suppliers, adding additional leased trains to our supply system and purchasing locally mined coal which can be delivered without using the railroads. Such measures could result in increased fuel and purchased power expenditures.\nNatural gas is delivered to our generation fleet at Riverton, State Line, and Energy Center via Southern Star Central Gas Pipeline. Although we have firm transportation contracts in place for a limited volume of daily natural gas deliveries, the actual delivery of natural gas can still be uncertain during winter peaking weather. The inability to procure commodity or pipeline curtailments for non-firm delivery causes us to either rely on fuel oil as a back-up fuel for generation at State Line unit 1 or Energy Center units, and/or limit the generation offered into the SPP IM from State Line Combined Cycle and Riverton. As a result, we could incur higher fuel and purchased power costs than if the units were available for full commitment and dispatch.\nWe have also established a risk management practice of purchasing contracts for future fuel needs to meet underlying customer needs and manage cost and pricing uncertainty. Within this activity, we may incur losses from these contracts. By using physical and financial instruments, we are exposed to credit risk and market risk. Market risk is the exposure to a change in the value of commodities caused by fluctuations in market variables, such as price. The fair value of derivative financial instruments we hold is adjusted cumulatively on a monthly basis until prescribed determination periods. At the end of each determination period, which is the last day of each calendar month in the period, any realized gain or loss for that period related to the contract will be reclassified to fuel expense and recovered or refunded to the customer through our fuel adjustment mechanisms. Credit risk is the risk that the counterparty might fail to fulfill its obligations under contractual terms.\nWe are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including the rates that we can charge customers.\nWe are subject to comprehensive regulation by federal and state utility regulatory agencies, which significantly influences our operating environment and our ability to recover our costs from utility customers. The utility commissions in the states where we operate regulate many aspects of our utility operations, including the rates that we can charge customers, siting and construction of facilities, pipeline safety and compliance, customer service and our ability to recover costs we incur, including capital expenditures and fuel and purchased power costs.\nThe FERC has jurisdiction over wholesale rates for electric transmission service and electric energy sold in interstate commerce. Federal, state and local agencies also have jurisdiction over many of our other activities.\nInformation concerning recent filings requesting increases in rates and related matters is set forth under Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Rate Matters.\"\nWe are also subject to prudency and similar reviews by regulators of costs we incur, including capital expenditures, fuel and purchased power costs and other operating costs.\nWe are unable to predict the impact on our operating results from the regulatory activities of any of these agencies, including any regulatory disallowances that could result from prudency reviews. Despite our requests, these regulatory commissions have sole discretion to leave rates unchanged, grant increases or order decreases in the base rates we charge our utility customers. They have similar authority with respect to our recovery of increases in our fuel and purchased power costs. Rate proceedings through which our prices and terms of service are determined typically involve numerous parties including customers, consumer advocates and governmental entities, some of whom take positions adverse to us. In addition, regulators' decisions may be appealed to the courts by us or other parties to the proceedings. These factors may lead to uncertainty and delays in implementing changes to our prices or terms of service. If our costs increase and we are unable to recover increased costs through base rates or fuel adjustment clauses, or if we are unable to fully recover our investments in new facilities, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Changes in regulations or the imposition of additional regulations could also have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIn addition, although the current rate making process provides recovery of some future changes in rate base and operating costs, it does not reflect all changes in costs for the period in which new retail rates will be in place. This results in a lag (commonly referred to as \"regulatory lag\") between the time we incur costs and the time when we can start recovering the costs through rates. This may result in under-recovery of costs, failure to earn the authorized return on investment, or both.\nOperations risks may adversely affect our business and financial results.\nThe operation of our electric generation, and electric and gas transmission and distribution systems involves many risks, including breakdown or failure of expensive and sophisticated equipment, processes and personnel performance; inability to attract and retain management and other key personnel; workplace and public safety; operating limitations that may be imposed by workforce issues, equipment conditions, environmental or other regulatory requirements; fuel supply or fuel transportation reductions or interruptions; transmission scheduling constraints; unauthorized physical access to our facilities; and catastrophic events such as fires, explosions, severe weather (including tornadoes and ice storms), acts of terrorism or other similar occurrences.\nWe have implemented training and preventive maintenance programs and have security systems and related protective infrastructure in place, but there is no assurance that these programs will prevent or minimize future breakdowns, outages or failures of our generation facilities or related business processes. In those cases, we would need to either produce replacement power from our other facilities or purchase power from other suppliers at potentially volatile and higher cost in order to meet our sales obligations, or implement emergency back-up business system processing procedures. In addition, certain catastrophic events can inflict extensive damage to our equipment and facilities which can require us to incur additional operating and maintenance expense and additional capital expenditures. Our prices may not always be adjusted timely and adequately to reflect these higher costs.\nThese and other operating events and conditions may reduce our revenues, increase costs, or both, and may materially affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nThe regional power market in which we operate has changing market and transmission structures, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nThe SPP RTO is mandated by the FERC to ensure a reliable power supply, an adequate transmission infrastructure and competitive wholesale electricity prices. The SPP RTO functions as reliability coordinator, tariff administrator and regional scheduler for its member utilities, including us. Essentially, the SPP RTO independently operates our transmission system as it interfaces and coordinates with the regional power grid. SPP RTO activities directly impact our control of owned generating assets and the development and cost of transmission infrastructure projects within the SPP RTO region. The cost allocation methodology applied to these transmission infrastructure projects will increase our operating expenses.\nThe SPP RTO implemented a Day-Ahead Market, or IM, in March 2014. The SPP IM functions as a centralized dispatch, where we and other members submit offers to sell power and bids to purchase power. The SPP matches offers and bids to supply the next day generation needs of its members. It is expected that 90%-95% of all next day generation needed throughout the SPP territory will be cleared through this IM. This change could impact our fuel costs, however, the net financial effect of these IM transactions will be processed through our fuel adjustment mechanisms.\nInformation concerning recent and pending SPP RTO and other FERC activities can be found under Note 3 of \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" under Item 8.\nSecurity breaches, criminal activity, terrorist attacks and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure could directly or indirectly interfere with our operations, could expose us or our customers or employees to a risk of loss, and could expose us to liability, regulatory penalties, reputational damage and other harm to our business.\nWe rely upon information technology networks and systems to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity, supply chain functions, and the invoicing and collection of payments from our customers. We also use information technology systems to record, process and summarize financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with financial reporting, legal and tax requirements. Our technology networks and systems collect and store sensitive data including system operating information, proprietary business information belonging to us and third parties, and personal information belonging to our customers and employees.\nOur information technology networks and infrastructure may be vulnerable to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by hackers or breaches due to employee error or malfeasance, or other disruptions during software or hardware upgrades, telecommunication failures or natural disasters or other catastrophic events. The occurrence of any of these events could impact the reliability of our generation, transmission and distribution systems; could expose us, our customers or our employees to a risk of loss or misuse of information; and could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties against us, damage our reputation or otherwise harm our business. We cannot accurately assess the probability that a security breach may occur, despite the measures that we take to prevent such a breach, and we are unable to quantify the potential impact of such an event. We can provide no assurance that we will identify and remedy all security or system vulnerabilities or that unauthorized access or error will be identified and remedied.\nAdditionally, we cannot predict the impact that any future information technology or terrorist attack may have on the energy industry in general. Our facilities could be direct targets or indirect casualties of such attacks. The effects of such attacks could include disruption to our generation, transmission and distribution systems or to the electrical grid in general, and could increase the cost of insurance coverage or result in a decline in the U.S. economy.\nWe may be unable to recover increases in the cost of natural gas from our natural gas utility customers, or may lose customers as a result of any price increases.\nIn our natural gas utility business, we are permitted to recover the cost of gas directly from our customers through the use of a purchased gas adjustment provision. Our purchased gas adjustment provision is regularly reviewed by the MPSC. In addition to reviewing our adjustments to customer rates, the MPSC reviews our costs for prudency as well. To the extent the MPSC may determine certain costs were not incurred prudently, it could adversely affect our gas segment earnings and cash flows. In addition, increases in natural gas costs affect total prices to our customers and, therefore, the competitive position of gas relative to electricity and other forms of energy. Increases in natural gas costs may also result in lower usage by customers unable to switch to alternate fuels. Such disallowed costs or customer losses could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny reduction in our credit ratings could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCurrently, our corporate credit ratings and the ratings for our securities are as follows:\n*Not rated.\nThe ratings indicate the agencies' assessment of our ability to pay the interest and principal of these securities. A rating is not a recommendation to purchase, sell or hold securities and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. The lower the rating, the higher the interest cost of the securities when they are sold. In addition, a downgrade in our senior unsecured long-term debt rating would result in an increase in our borrowing costs under our bank credit facility. If any of our ratings fall below investment grade (investment grade is defined as Baa3 or above for Moody's and BBB- or above for Standard & Poor's and Fitch), our ability to issue short-term debt, commercial paper or other securities or to market those securities would be impaired or made more difficult or expensive. Therefore, any such downgrades could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any actual downgrade of our commercial paper rating from Moody's or Fitch, may make it difficult for us to issue commercial paper. To the extent we are unable to issue commercial paper, we will need to meet our short-term debt needs through borrowings under our revolving credit facilities, which may result in higher costs.\nWe cannot assure you that any of our current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant.\nThe cost and schedule of construction projects may materially change.\nOur capital expenditure budget for the next three years is estimated to be $387.4 million. This includes expenditures for environmental upgrades to our existing facilities and additions to our transmission and distribution systems. There are risks that actual costs may exceed budget estimates, delays may occur in obtaining permits and materials, suppliers and contractors may not perform as required under their contracts, there may be inadequate availability, productivity or increased cost of qualified craft labor, start-up activities may take longer than planned, the scope and timing of projects may change, and other\nevents beyond our control may occur that may materially affect the schedule, budget, cost and performance of projects. To the extent the completion of projects is delayed, we expect that the timing of receipt of increases in base rates reflecting our investment in such projects will be correspondingly delayed. Costs associated with these projects will also be subject to prudency review by regulators as part of future rate case filings and all costs may not be allowed recovery.\nFinancial market disruptions may increase financing costs, limit access to the credit markets or cause reductions in investment values in our pension plan assets.\nWe estimate our capital expenditures to be $172.7 million in 2015. Although we believe it is unlikely we will have difficulty accessing the markets for the capital needed to complete these projects (if such a need arises), financing costs could fluctuate. Financial market disruptions and volatility in discount rates could lead to increased funding obligations due to reduced asset values and increased benefit obligations. During 2014, our net pension and OPEB liability increased $40.5 million. Our funding policy is to contribute annually an amount at least equal to the actuarial cost of postretirement benefits. The actual minimum pension funding requirements will be determined based on the results of the actuarial valuations and the performance of our pension assets during the current year. Future market changes could result in increased pension and OPEB liabilities and funding obligations.\nFailure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCertain events, such as an aging workforce, mismatch of skill set or complement to future needs, or unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges and increased costs. The challenges include lack of resources, loss of knowledge base and the lengthy time required for skill development. In this case, costs, including costs for contractors to replace employees, productivity costs and safety costs, may rise. Failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees, including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to new employees, or future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate the business. If we are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to adverse publicity and reputational risks, which makes us vulnerable to negative customer perception and increased regulatory oversight or other sanctions.\nLike other utility companies, we have a large consumer customer base and, as a result, are subject to public criticism focused on the reliability of our distribution services and the speed with which we are able to respond to outages caused by storm damage or other unanticipated events. Adverse publicity of this nature may render legislatures, public utility commissions and other regulatory authorities and government officials, less likely to view public utility companies in a favorable light, and may cause us to be susceptible to less favorable legislative and regulatory outcomes or increased regulatory oversight. Unfavorable regulatory outcomes can include more stringent laws and regulations governing our operations, such as reliability and customer service quality standards or vegetation management requirements, as well as fines, penalties or other sanctions or requirements. The imposition of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 23042, "SIC": 4911, "TIC": "EDE"}
