RISK FACTORS\nThere have been a number of material developments both within the Company and the long-term care industry. These developments have had and are likely to continue to have a material impact on us. This section summarizes these developments, as well as other risks that should be considered by our shareholders and prospective investors.\nRisks Related to our Operations\nWe are substantially self-insured and have significant potential professional liability exposure.\nThe provision of health care services entails an inherent risk of liability. Participants in the health care industry are subject to an increasing number of lawsuits alleging malpractice, negligence, product liability or related legal theories, many of which involve large claims and significant defense costs. Like many other companies engaged in the long-term care profession in the United States, we have numerous pending liability claims, disputes and legal actions for professional liability and other related issues. We expect to continue to be subject to such suits as a result of the nature of our business. We have professional liability insurance coverage for our nursing centers that, based on historical claims experience, is likely to be substantially less than the amount required to satisfy claims that are expected to be incurred. See \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings\u201d for further descriptions of pending claims and see \u201cItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition - Accounting Policies and Judgments - Professional Liability and Other Self-Insurance Reserves\u201d for discussion of our reserve for self-insured claims and of our ability to meet our anticipated cash needs.\nWe may have substantial adjustments to our accrual for professional liability claims which could cause significant changes in our net earnings.\nEach year, we record adjustments to our accrual for self-insured risks associated with professional liability claims. While these adjustments to the accrual result in changes to reported expenses and income, they are not directly related to changes in cash because the accrual is not funded. These self-insurance reserves are assessed on a quarterly basis, with changes in estimated losses being recorded in the consolidated statements of operations in the period identified. Any increase in the accrual decreases income in the period, and any reduction in the accrual increases income during the period. Our actual professional liabilities may vary significantly from the accrual due to an increase in the number of claims asserted or claim costs in excess of estimates, and the amount of the accrual has and may continue to fluctuate by a material amount in any given quarter. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we recorded professional liability expense of $11.8 million, $10.8 million and $8.5 million, respectively.\nOur outstanding indebtedness is subject to various financial covenants and floating rates of interest which could be subject to fluctuations based on changing interest rates.\nWe have long-term indebtedness of $73.6 million at December 31, 2018. Certain of our debt agreements contain various financial covenants, the most restrictive of which relate to minimum cash deposits, cash flow and debt service coverage ratios. As of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with these financial covenants. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of some or all of our debts. Such non-compliance could result in a material adverse impact to our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. See \u201cItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d for additional discussion of our covenants.\nIn connection with the refinancing transaction in February 2016 discussed in \u201cItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources,\u201d we entered into an interest rate swap with respect to a portion of the mortgage loan to mitigate the floating interest rate risk of such borrowing. The interest rate swap converted the variable rate on our mortgage indebtedness to a fixed interest rate for the five year term of this indebtedness, decreasing our exposure to risks of variable rates of interest. While limiting our risk to increases\nin interest rates by utilizing the interest rate swap, we forgo benefits that might result from downward fluctuations in interest rates. We also are exposed to the risk that our counterpart to the swap agreement will default on its obligations.\nOur accrual for professional liability claims is not funded, and if a material judgment is entered against us in any lawsuit, we may lack adequate cash to pay the judgment.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we are engaged in 78 professional liability lawsuits. Although we work diligently to limit the cash required to settle and defend professional liability claims, a significant judgment entered against us in one or more legal actions could have a material adverse impact on our cash flows and could result in our being unable to meet all of our cash needs as they become due.\nThe U.S. Department of Justice has commenced an investigation of our practices related to the provision of therapy and the completion of certain resident admission forms, which could adversely affect our operations and financial condition.\nOur business is currently under investigation for potential civil and criminal violations of the federal False Claims Act (\"FCA\") and other laws related to governmental health care benefit programs. See Legal Proceedings for further information regarding this investigation. Any finding that we are not in compliance with these laws could require us to change our operations or could subject us to treble damages, penalties and/or make us ineligible to participate in certain government funded healthcare programs, any of which could in turn significantly harm our business and financial condition.\nOur operational and strategic flexibility is limited due to the number of our centers that are leased from third parties.\nA substantial majority of our centers are leased from third parties including 34 centers leased from Omega and 20 centers leased from Golden Living. The loss or deterioration of our relationship with either of these landlords may adversely affect our business. The terms of such leases generally require us to operate such centers as skilled nursing centers, and generally do not allow us to assign the lease to a third party without the applicable landlord\u2019s consent. Therefore, our ability to divest such leased properties is limited, and we may be forced to continue operating such centers as skilled nursing centers even if doing so becomes unprofitable.\nWhile we expect to renew or extend our leases in the normal course of business, there can be no assurance that these rights will be exercised in the future or that we will be able to satisfy the conditions precedent to exercising any such renewal or extension, to the extent that such provisions exist in our leases. In addition, if we are unable to renew or extend any of our master leases, we may lose all of the facilities subject to that master lease agreement. If we are not able to renew or extend our leases at or prior to the end of the existing lease terms, or if the terms of such options are unfavorable or unacceptable to us, our business, financial condition and results of operation could be adversely affected.\nOur failure to pay rent or otherwise comply with the provisions of any of our Master Lease Agreements could materially adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.\nMany of our facilities are under a Master Lease Agreement. Our failure to pay the rent or otherwise comply with the provisions of any of our lease agreements could result in an \u201cevent of default\u201d under such lease agreement and also could result in a cross default under other master lease agreements and the agreements for our indebtedness. Upon an event of default, remedies available to our landlords generally include, without limitation, terminating such lease agreement, repossessing and reletting the leased properties and requiring us to remain liable for all obligations under such lease agreement, including the difference between the rent under such lease agreement and the rent payable as a result of reletting the leased properties, or requiring us to pay the net present value of the rent due for the balance of the term of such lease agreement. The exercise of such remedies would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity. An event of default under any of our Master Lease Agreements could result in a default under the Credit Facilities and, if repayment of the borrowings under the Credit Facilities were accelerated, the payments under the indentures governing our outstanding notes could also be accelerated. The exercise of remedies by any of our landlords could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.\nWe are highly dependent on reimbursement by third-party payors and delays in reimbursement for any reason may cause liquidity problems.\nSubstantially all of our nursing center revenues are directly or indirectly dependent upon reimbursement from third-party payors, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs and private insurers. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our patient revenues from continuing operations derived from Medicaid, Medicare, Managed Care and private pay (including private insurers) sources were approximately 52.5%, 24.8%, 8.1%, and 14.6%, respectively, as adjusted to Legacy GAAP). Changes in the mix of our patients among Medicare, Medicaid, Managed Care and private pay categories and among\ndifferent types of private pay sources may affect our net revenues and profitability. Our net revenues and profitability are also affected by the continuing efforts of all payors to contain or reduce the costs of health care. Efforts to impose reduced payments, greater discounts and more stringent cost controls by government and other payors are expected to continue.\nThe federal government makes frequent changes to the reimbursement provided under the Medicare program. For example, in July 2018, CMS finalized a rule that will change the case-mix model used under the skilled nursing facility prospective payment system effective October 2019. The new model, known as the Patient-Driven Payment Model, intends to shift the focus to the patient\u2019s condition and resulting care needs rather than the amount of care provided in order to determine Medicare reimbursement. Future changes to payment rates or methodology could significantly reduce the reimbursement we receive. Also, a number of state governments, including several of the states in which we operate, face projected budget shortfalls and/or deficit spending situations. Because Medicaid is typically a substantial part of a state\u2019s budget, many states are considering or have implemented strategies to reduce Medicaid spending or decrease spending growth. Some states are exploring or implementing alternatives to traditional long-term care, including community and home-based nursing services.\nAny changes in reimbursement levels or in the timing of payments under Medicare, Medicaid or private pay programs and any changes in applicable government regulations could have a material adverse effect on our net revenues, net income (loss) and cash flows. We are limited in our ability to reduce the direct costs of providing care. We are unable to predict the nature and success of future financial or delivery system reforms or the effect such changes will have on our operations. No assurance can be given that such reforms will not have a material adverse effect on us. See \u201cItem 1. Business - Government Regulation and Reimbursement.\u201d\nIf we have problems with our information systems that affect payment or if other issues arise with Medicare, Medicaid or other payors that affect the amount or timeliness of reimbursements, we may encounter delays in our payment cycle. Any significant payment timing delay could cause us to experience working capital shortages. Working capital management, including prompt and diligent billing and collection, is an important factor in our consolidated results of operations and liquidity. Our working capital management procedures may not successfully mitigate the effects of any delays in our receipt of payments or reimbursements. Accordingly, such delays could have an adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition.\nWe operate in an industry that is highly competitive.\nThe long-term care industry generally, and the nursing home business particularly, is highly competitive. We face direct competition for the acquisition of centers. In turn, our centers face competition for patients. Our ability to compete is based on several factors including, but not limited to, building age and appearance, reputation, relationships with referral sources, availability of patients, survey history and CMS rankings. Some of our present and potential competitors are significantly larger and have or may obtain greater financial and marketing resources than we can. In addition, some competitors are implementing vertical alignment strategies. For example, some hospitals provide long-term care services and some providers are aligned or are pursuing alignment strategies with payors. Certain of our competitors are operated by not-for-profit, non-taxpaying or governmental agencies that can finance capital expenditures on a tax exempt basis and receive funds and charitable contributions unavailable to us. In addition, we may encounter substantial competition from new market entrants. Consequently, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter increased competition in the future, which could limit our ability to attract patients or expand our business, and could materially and adversely affect our business or decrease our market share.\nWe may have difficulty attracting and retaining qualified nurses, therapists, healthcare professionals and other key personnel, which, along with a growing number of minimum wage and compensation related regulations, may increase our costs related to these employees.\nOur team members are essential to our business. We rely on our ability to attract and retain qualified nurses, therapists and other healthcare professionals. The market for these key personnel is highly competitive, and we could experience significant increases in our operating costs due to shortages in their availability. Like other healthcare providers, we have at times experienced difficulties in attracting and retaining qualified personnel. We may continue to experience increases in our labor costs, primarily due to higher wages and greater benefits required to attract and retain qualified healthcare personnel, and such increases may adversely affect our profitability. Furthermore, while we attempt to manage overall labor costs in the most efficient way, our efforts to manage them through wage freezes and similar means may have limited effectiveness and may lead to increased turnover and other challenges.\nTight labor markets and high demand for such team members can contribute to high turnover among clinical professional staff. A shortage of qualified personnel at a facility could result in significant increases in labor costs and increased\nreliance on overtime and expensive temporary staffing agencies, and could otherwise adversely affect operations at the affected centers. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified professionals, our ability to adequately provide services to our residents and patients may decline and our ability to grow may be constrained.\nOur cost of labor may be influenced by unanticipated factors in certain markets or, with respect to collective bargaining agreements that we are a party to, we may experience above-market increases. A substantial number of our team members are hourly team members whose wage rates are affected by increases in the federal or state minimum wage rate. As collective bargaining agreements are renegotiated or minimum wage rates increase we may need to increase the wages paid to team members. This may be applicable to not only minimum wage team members but also to team members at wage rates which are currently above the minimum wage.\nThe Department of Labor issued rule changes to the Fair Labor Standards Act that increased the minimum salary threshold for team members exempt from overtime along with an automatic annual increase to this salary threshold. The future of these rule changes, as well as other potential changes, remains uncertain given the recent change in Presidential administrations. However, these rule changes could increase our cost of services provided.\nBecause we are largely funded by government programs according to predetermined, nonnegotiable rates, we do not have an ability to pass such wage increases through to revenue sources. Any such mandated wage increases could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nPossible changes in the acuity of residents and patients, as well as payor mix and payment methodologies, may significantly affect our profitability.\nThe sources and amount of our revenues are determined by a number of factors, including the occupancy rates of our facilities, the length of stay, the payor mix of residents and patients, rates of reimbursement, and patient acuity. Changes in patient acuity as well as payor mix among private pay, Medicare, and Medicaid may significantly affect our profitability. In particular, any significant decrease in our population of high-acuity patients or any significant increase in our Medicaid population could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity, especially if state Medicaid programs continue to limit, or more aggressively seek limits on, reimbursement rates or service levels.\nThe industry trend toward value-based purchasing may negatively impact our revenues.\nThere is a growing trend in the healthcare industry among both government and commercial payors toward value-based purchasing of healthcare services. Value-based purchasing programs emphasize quality and efficiency of services, rather than volume of services. For example, the SNF VBP program makes incentive payments available based on past performance on specified quality measures related to hospital readmissions. Failure to report quality data or poor performance may negatively impact the amount of reimbursement received.\nOther initiatives aimed at improving quality and cost of care include alternative payment models, such as ACOs and bundled payment arrangements. It is unclear whether alternative models will successfully coordinate care and reduce costs or whether they will decrease overall reimbursement. Additionally, commercial payors have expressed intent to shift toward value-based reimbursement arrangements.\nWe expect value-based purchasing programs, including programs that condition reimbursement on patient outcome measures, to become more common and to involve a higher percentage of reimbursement amounts. While we believe we are adapting our business strategies to compete in a value-based reimbursement environment, we are unable at this time to predict how this trend will affect our results of operations. If we are unable to meet or exceed quality performance standards under any applicable value-based purchasing program, perform at a level below the outcomes demonstrated by our competitors, or otherwise fail to effectively provide or coordinate the efficient delivery of quality healthcare services, our reputation in the industry may be negatively impacted, we may receive reduced reimbursement amounts, and we may owe repayments to payors, causing our revenues to decline.\nOur systems are subject to security breaches and other cybersecurity incidents.\nWhile we maintain information technology security and safeguards, complex medical systems have been and may continue to be targeted for cyber attacks, which may result in unauthorized parties obtaining access to our computer systems and networks. Cyber attacks could result in the misappropriation of our patient information that is protected by law, private employee information, proprietary business information and technology or result in interruptions to our business. The reliability and security of our information technology infrastructure is critical to our business. To the extent that any disruptions or security breaches result in significant loss or damage to our data, or inappropriate use or disclosure of\npatient, employee or proprietary information, we could be required to notify affected individuals, state and federal agencies and the media of the breach, could experience damage to our reputation and patient relationships and be subject to civil and/or criminal fines and penalties or related class action litigation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe success of previous and future acquisitions cannot be guaranteed and such acquisitions may consume substantial capital and other resources and could expose us to unforeseen liabilities and integration risks.\nWe have in the past and plan to in the future make investments in additional centers, whether by opening new centers or acquiring existing centers. Such acquisitions may involve significant cash expenditures, debt incurrence, operating losses and additional expenses that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulties integrating acquired operations, personnel and accounting and information systems, or in realizing projected efficiencies and cost savings;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management's attention from other business concerns;\n\u2022\npotential loss of key team members or customers of acquired companies;\n\u2022\nentry into markets in which we may have limited or no experience;\n\u2022\nincreased indebtedness and reduced ability to access additional capital when needed;\n\u2022\nassumption of unknown liabilities or regulatory issues of acquired companies, including failure to comply with healthcare regulations or to establish internal financial controls; and\n\u2022\nstraining of our resources, including internal controls relating to information and accounting systems, regulatory compliance, logistics and others.\nFurthermore, certain of the foregoing risks could be exacerbated when combined with other growth measures that we may pursue.\nInvesting in our business initiatives and development could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe plan to invest in business initiatives and development that will increase our operating expenses. These initiatives may or may not be successful in growing our census or revenues. A part of our business initiative is to emphasize our skilled nursing facilities' care on patients with shorter stays but higher acuities. Shorter stays may result in decreased census during certain periods. In addition, there is typically a time delay between incurring such expenses and the attaining of revenues and cash flows expected from these initiatives and development. As a result, our revenue and operating cash flow may not increase enough during a reporting period to cover these increased expenses. Such additional revenues may not materialize to the level we anticipate, if at all.\nWe may be unable to reduce costs to offset decreases in our patient census levels or other expenses completely.\nWe depend on implementing adequate cost management initiatives in response to fluctuations in levels of patient census in our centers in order to maintain our current cash flow and earnings levels. Fluctuation in our patient census levels may become more common as we continue our emphasis in our skilled nursing facilities on patients with shorter stays but higher acuities. A decline in patient census levels would likely result in decreased revenue. If we are unable to put in place corresponding reductions in costs in response to decreases in our patient census or other revenue shortfalls, our financial condition and operating results would be adversely affected. There are limits in our ability to reduce the costs of our centers because we must maintain required staffing levels.\nDisasters and similar events may seriously harm our business.\nNatural and man-made disasters and similar events, including terrorist attacks and acts of nature such as hurricanes, tornados, earthquakes and wildfires, may cause damage or disruption to us, our employees and our centers, which could have an adverse impact on our patients and our business. In order to provide care for our patients, we are dependent on consistent and reliable delivery of food, pharmaceuticals, utilities and other goods to our centers, and the availability of employees to provide services at our centers. If the delivery of goods or the ability of employees to reach our centers were interrupted in any material respect due to a natural disaster or other reasons, it would have a significant impact on our centers and our business. Furthermore, the impact, or impending threat, of a natural disaster has in the past and may in the future require that we evacuate one or more centers, which would be costly and would involve risks, including potentially fatal risks, for the patients. The impact of disasters and similar events is inherently uncertain. Such events could harm our patients and employees, severely damage or destroy one or more of our centers, harm our business, reputation and financial performance, or otherwise cause our business to suffer in ways that we currently cannot predict.\nFailure to maintain effective internal control over our financial reporting could have an adverse effect on our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), and is required to evaluate the effectiveness of these controls and procedures on a periodic basis and publicly disclose the results of these evaluations and related matters in accordance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports, to help mitigate the risk of fraud and to operate successfully. However, testing and maintaining our internal control over financial reporting can be expensive and divert our management's attention from other business matters. Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal controls could result in material weaknesses or material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements.\nIf we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, we may be required to take corrective measures or restate the affected historical financial statements. In addition, we may be subjected to investigations and/or sanctions by federal and state securities regulators, and/or civil lawsuits by security holders. Any of the foregoing could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and in our company and would likely result in a decline in the market price of our stock and in our ability to raise additional financing if needed in the future.\nIncreasing costs of being publicly owned could impact our future consolidated financial position and results of operations\nSignificant regulatory changes, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and rules and regulations promulgated as a result of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, have increased, and in the future, are likely to further increase general and administrative costs. In order to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the listing standards of the Nasdaq exchange, and rules implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), we have had to hire additional personnel and utilize additional outside legal, accounting and advisory services, and may continue to require such additional resources. Moreover, in the rapidly changing regulatory environment in which we operate, there is significant uncertainty as to what will be required to comply with many of the regulations. As a result, we may be required to spend substantially more than we currently estimate, and may need to divert resources from other activities, as we develop our compliance plans.\nNew accounting pronouncements or new interpretations of existing standards could require us to make adjustments in our accounting policies that could affect our financial statements.\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cGAAP\u201d). The Financial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC, or other accounting organizations or governmental entities frequently issue new pronouncements or new interpretations of existing accounting standards. Changes in accounting standards, how the accounting standards are interpreted, or the adoption of new accounting standards can have a significant effect on our reported results, and could even retroactively affect previously reported transactions, and may require that we make significant changes to our systems, processes and controls.\nChanges resulting from these new standards may result in materially different financial results and may require that we change how we process, analyze and report financial information and that we change financial reporting controls. Such changes in accounting standards may have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, and income, which may negatively impact our financial results.\nChanges in lease accounting standards may materially and adversely affect us.\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, adopted new accounting rules to be effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018 which generally will require companies to capitalize long term leases on their balance sheets by recognizing lessees\u2019 rights and obligations. When the rules are effective, we will be required to account for the leases for our centers, including those with Omega and Golden Living, in the assets and liabilities on our balance sheet,. As a result, a significant amount of lease related assets and liabilities will be recorded on our balance sheet and we may be required to make other changes to the recording and classification of our lease related expenses. Though these changes will not have any direct impact on our overall financial condition, these changes could cause investors or others to believe that we are highly leveraged and could change the calculations of financial metrics and covenants, as well as third party financial models regarding our financial condition.\nCertain events or circumstances could result in the impairment of our assets that result in material charges to earnings.\nWe review the carrying value of certain long-lived assets, finite-lived intangible assets and indefinite-lived intangible assets with respect to any events or circumstances that indicate an impairment or an adjustment to the amortization period may be necessary. If circumstances suggest that the recorded amounts of any of these assets cannot be recovered based upon estimated future cash flows, the carrying values of such assets are reduced to fair value. If the carrying value of any of these assets is impaired, we may incur a material charge to earnings. Any such impairment charges could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Government Regulations\nWe are subject to significant government regulation.\nThe health care industry is subject to numerous laws and regulations of federal, state and local governments. These laws and regulations include, but are not necessarily limited to, matters such as licensure, accreditation, government health care program participation requirements, protection of patient health information, reimbursement for patient services, quality of patient care, Medicare and Medicaid fraud and abuse, debt collection and communications with consumers. Various federal and state laws regulate relationships among providers of services, including employment or service contracts and investment relationships. The operation of long-term care centers and the provision of services are also subject to extensive federal, state, and local laws relating to, among other things, the adequacy of medical care, distribution of pharmaceuticals, equipment, personnel, operating policies, environmental compliance, compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act, fire prevention and compliance with building codes.\nLong-term care facilities are subject to periodic inspection to assure continued compliance with various standards and licensing requirements under state law, as well as with Medicare and Medicaid conditions of participation. The failure to obtain or renew any required regulatory approvals or licenses could prevent us from offering our existing or additional services, subject us to penalties, and adversely affect our growth. In addition, health care is an area of extensive and frequent regulatory change. Changes in the laws or new interpretations of existing laws can have a significant effect on methods and costs of doing business and amounts of payments received from governmental and other payors. Our operations could be adversely affected by, among other things, regulatory developments such as mandatory increases in the scope and quality of care to be afforded patients and revisions in licensing and certification standards. We attempt at all times to comply with all applicable laws; however, there can be no assurance that we will remain in compliance at all times with all applicable laws and regulations or that new legislation or administrative or judicial interpretation of existing laws or regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition. Federal or state proceedings seeking to impose fines and penalties for violations of applicable laws and regulations, as well as federal and state changes in these laws and regulations, may negatively impact us. See \u201cItem 1. Business - Government Regulation.\u201d See also \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings.\u201d\nWe are the subject of governmental audits, investigations, claims and litigation, which could have an adverse effect on our business or financial position.\nHealthcare companies are subject to high levels of regulatory scrutiny. Various government agencies and their agents may conduct audits of our operations, including the Department of Health and Human Services (\u201cHHS\u201d) Office of Inspector General (\u201cOIG\u201d), which is tasked with combating fraud, waste and abuse within the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The OIG\u2019s enforcement priorities are outlined in a work plan that is updated monthly. These priorities include life safety reviews, compliant billing, quality of care, poorly performing nursing facilities, hospitalizations, criminal background checks, Medicare part B services, accuracy of clinical data collected by nursing facilities , transparency of ownership, and civil monetary penalty funds. We cannot predict the likelihood, scope or outcome of any OIG investigations of our centers.\nThe costs associated with potential litigation or the public announcement that we are being investigated, even if a dispute is resolved in our favor, or any determination that we have violated laws or regulations could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations. In particular, government investigations, as well as qui tam lawsuits, may lead to significant penalties, including fines, damages payments or exclusion from government healthcare programs. Settlements of lawsuits involving Medicare and Medicaid issues routinely involve both financial penalties and corporate integrity agreements, either of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations.\nPayments we receive from Medicare and Medicaid are subject to audits. Such audits could result in an obligation to refund amounts previously paid to us.\nPayments we receive from Medicare and Medicaid can be retroactively adjusted after examination during the claims settlement process or as a result of post-payment audits. Private pay sources also reserve the right to conduct audits. Payors may disallow our requests for reimbursement, or recoup amounts previously reimbursed, based on determinations by the payors or their third-party audit contractors that certain costs are not reimbursable because either adequate or additional documentation was not provided or because certain services were not covered or deemed to not be medically necessary. We believe that billing and reimbursement errors and disagreements are common in our industry. Significant adjustments, recoupments or repayments of our Medicare or Medicaid revenue could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are subject to claims under false claims, self-referral and anti-kickback prohibitions.\nWe are subject to numerous federal and state laws intended to prevent fraud, waste and abuse within the healthcare industry. Violations of these laws may result in substantial damage awards, civil or criminal penalties for individuals or entities, including large civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in the Medicare or Medicaid programs. Such awards, exclusion or penalties, if applied to us, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and profitability.\nIn the United States, various federal laws regulate the relationships between providers of health care services, physicians, and other clinicians. These laws impose restrictions on physician referrals for designated health services to entities with which they have financial relationships. These laws also prohibit the offering, payment, solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration in return for the referral of Medicare or Medicaid patients or patient care opportunities for the purchase, lease or order of any item or service that is covered by the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Many states in which we operate have similar anti-kickback and self-referral laws that may apply to all payors or a broader range of services. To the extent that we, any of our centers through which we do business, or any of the owners or directors have a financial relationship with each other or with other health care entities providing services to long-term care patients, such relationships could be subject to increased scrutiny.\nFederal and state laws prohibit the submission of false claims for reimbursement and prohibit the making of false claims or statements. The submission of false claims or false statements may lead to the imposition of significant civil monetary penalties, significant criminal fines and imprisonment, and/or exclusion from participation in state and federally-funded healthcare programs, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Under the FCA, actions against a provider can be initiated by the federal government or by a private party on behalf of the federal government. These private parties, who are often referred to as \u201cqui tam relators\u201d or \u201crelators,\u201d are entitled to share in any amounts recovered by the government. Both direct enforcement activity by the government and qui tam relator actions have increased significantly in recent years.\nA FCA violation occurs when a provider knowingly submits a claim for items or services not provided. Liability also arises for the knowing failure to report and refund an overpayment received from the government. Some courts have held that providers who allegedly have violated other statutes, such as self-referral or kickback laws, have thereby submitted false claims under the FCA. Allegations of poor quality of care can also lead to FCA actions under a theory of worthless services, which contends that care provided was so deficient that it was tantamount to no service at all.\nThe implied certification theory expands of the scope of the FCA. Under the implied certification theory, a violation of the FCA occurs when a provider\u2019s request for payment implies a certification of compliance with the applicable statutes, regulations or contract provisions that are preconditions to payment. The recognition of this theory has increased the risk that a healthcare company will have to defend a false claims action, pay fines and treble damages or settlement amounts or be excluded from the federal and state healthcare programs as a result of an investigation arising out of the FCA. Many states have enacted similar laws providing for imposition of civil and criminal penalties for the filing of fraudulent claims.\nBecause we submit thousands of claims to Medicare each year and there is a relatively long statute of limitations under the FCA, there is a risk that intentional, or even negligent or recklessly submitted claims that prove to be incorrect, or billing errors, cost reporting errors or lapses in statutory or regulatory compliance with regard to the provision of healthcare services (including, without limitation the Anti-Kickback Statue and the self-referral laws discussed above), could result in significant civil or criminal penalties against us. At least one false claims act case is pending against us, and there can be no assurance that our operations will not be subject to review, scrutiny, penalties or enforcement actions under these laws, or that these laws will not change in the future. Any penalties or allegations involving false claims, whether valid or not, could have a significant impact on our business.\nWe are subject to laws governing the confidentiality of patient health information.\nBoth federal and state laws impose certain requirements regarding maintaining the confidentiality of patient health information. In particular, HIPAA regulations require us to protect the medical records and other personal health information of our patients, limit our use of and ability to disclose such information, give patients a right to access and amend their personal health information, and notify affected patients, HHS, and, in the case of large breaches, the media of breaches involving unsecure patient health information. A violation of HIPAA or any other federal or state laws regarding the confidentiality or use of such information could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, and could in turn damage our reputation, affect our ability to attract or retain patients, and thereby have a material adverse effect on our revenues, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe cannot predict the effects that healthcare reform initiatives, including possible repeal or invalidation of or changes to the Affordable Care Act, and other changes in government programs may have on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn recent years, there have been initiatives on the federal and state levels for comprehensive reforms affecting the availability, payment and reimbursement of healthcare services in the United States. The most prominent of these efforts is the Affordable Care Act, which affects how healthcare services are covered, delivered and reimbursed. However, there is significant uncertainty regarding the future of the Affordable Care Act. The Presidential administration and Congress have made significant changes to the law, its implementation and interpretation. For example, final rules issued in 2018 expand the availability of association health plans and allow the sale of short-term, limited-duration health plans, neither of which are required to cover all of the essential health benefits mandated by the Affordable Care Act. Effective January 1, 2019, Congress eliminated the penalty associated with the individual mandate to maintain health insurance. These changes may impact the number of individuals that elect to obtain public or private health insurance or the scope of such coverage, if purchased. Because the penalty associated with the individual mandate was eliminated, a federal judge in Texas ruled in December 2018 that the entire law was unconstitutional. However, the law remains in place pending appeal. It is difficult to predict the impact of the Affordable Care Act and related regulations or the impact of its modification on our operations in light of the uncertainty regarding whether, when or how the law will be further changed, the ultimate impact of court challenges, and what alternative reforms, if any, may be enacted. Significant changes to, or invalidation or repeal of, the Affordable Care Act or the adoption of other healthcare legislation or regulations could materially and adversely our business. For example, some members of Congress have proposed significantly expanding the coverage of government-funded programs.\nState efforts to regulate or deregulate the healthcare services industry or the construction or expansion of healthcare facilities could impair our ability to expand our operations, or could result in increased competition.\nSome states require healthcare providers to obtain prior approval, known as a CON, for:\n\u2022 the purchase, construction or expansion of healthcare facilities;\n\u2022 capital expenditures exceeding a prescribed amount; or\n\u2022 changes in services or bed capacity.\nIn addition, other states that do not require certificates of need have effectively barred the expansion of existing facilities and the development of new ones by placing partial or complete moratoria on the number of new Medicaid beds they will certify in certain areas or in the entire state. Other states have established such stringent development standards and approval procedures for constructing new healthcare facilities that the construction of new facilities, or the expansion or renovation of existing facilities, may become cost prohibitive or extremely time-consuming. In addition, some states the acquisition of a facility being operated by a non-profit organization requires the approval of the state Attorney General.\nOur ability to acquire or construct new facilities or expand or provide new services at existing facilities would be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain the necessary approvals, if there are changes in the standards applicable to those approvals, or if we experience delays and increased expenses associated with obtaining those approvals. We may not be able to obtain licensure, CON approval, Medicaid certification, Attorney General approval or other necessary approvals for future expansion projects. Conversely, the elimination or reduction of state regulations that limit the construction, expansion or renovation of new or existing facilities could result in increased competition to us or result in overbuilding of facilities in some of our markets. If overbuilding in the healthcare industry in the markets in which we operate were to occur, it could reduce the occupancy rates of existing facilities and, in some cases, might reduce the private rates that we charge for our services.\nChanges to federal and state income tax laws and regulations could adversely affect our position on income taxes and estimated income liabilities.\nWe are subject to both state and federal income taxes in the U.S. and our operations, plans and results are affected by tax and other initiatives. On December 22, 2017, a law commonly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201cTax Act\") was enacted in the United States. Among other things, the Tax Act reduces the U.S. corporate income tax rate to 21 percent, which could result in changes in the valuation of our deferred tax asset and liabilities. Any such change in valuation could have a material impact on our income tax expense and deferred tax balances.\nWe are also subject to regular reviews, examinations, and audits by the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities with respect to our taxes. There are uncertainties and ambiguities in the application of the Tax Act and it is possible that the IRS could issue subsequent guidance or take positions on audit that differ from our interpretations and assumptions. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, if a taxing authority disagrees with the positions we have taken, we could face additional tax liability, including interest and penalties. Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in states with different statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws and regulations, changes in our interpretations of tax laws, including the Tax Act. Unanticipated changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability. There can be no assurance that payment of such additional amounts upon final adjudication of any disputes will not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.\nWe may be subject to liability for environmental damages.\nUnder various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at the property, and may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred by those parties in connection with the contamination. These laws typically impose clean-up responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants, and liability under these laws has been interpreted to be joint and several unless the harm is divisible and there is a reasonable basis for allocation of responsibility. The costs of investigation, remediation or removal of the substances may be substantial. In addition, under our leases with Omega and Golden Living, we have agreed to indemnify the landlord for any such liabilities related to the properties that we lease from them. Persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances also may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of the substances at the disposal or treatment facility, whether or not the facility is owned or operated by the person. Finally, the owner of a site may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from a site. If we become subject to any of these claims, the costs involved could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock.\nAlthough we paid cash dividends from the second quarter of 2009 through the third quarter of 2018, we do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We currently anticipate that we will retain all of our available cash, if any, for use as working capital and for other general purposes, including to service or repay our debt and lease obligations as well as to fund the operations of our business. Any payment of future dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, lease obligations, statutory and contractual restrictions applying to the payment of dividends and other considerations that our board of directors deems relevant.\nWe have received a notice of delisting of our common stock from Nasdaq\u2019s Listing Qualifications Department indicating that, based upon Nasdaq\u2019s review of the Market Value of Listed Securities (\u201cMVLS\u201d) for the last 30 consecutive business days from November 2, 2018, the Company no longer meets the minimum MVLS of $35 million as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(2). If we fail to raise the MVLS of our common stock to at least $35 million, our common stock may be delisted from trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market.\nWe are required to meet certain financial criteria in order to maintain our listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market. One such requirement is that we maintain a MVLS of at least $35 million. On December 19, 2018, we received an initial notification letter from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Department indicating that the MVLS of our common stock had been below $35 million for the last 30 consecutive business days. In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rules 5810(c)(3)(C), the\nCompany has been provided a period of 180 calendar days, or until June 17, 2019, in which to regain compliance with the requirement. In order to regain compliance with the MVLS requirement, the Company must maintain a MVLS of at least $35 million for a minimum of ten consecutive business days during this 180-day period. The Company actively monitors the price of the Common Stock and will consider all available options to regain compliance with the continued listing standards. If at any time during this 180-day period the Company\u2019s MVLS closes at $35 million or more for a minimum of ten consecutive business days, Nasdaq will provide the Company written confirmation of compliance and this matter will be closed. If the Company does not regain compliance with this requirement by June 17, 2019, the Company will receive written notification that its securities are subject to delisting. At that time, the Company may appeal the delisting determination to a Hearing Panel. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in maintaining its listing of the Common Stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market.\nIf we were unable to maintain compliance with the MVLS requirement and our common stock were delisted from Nasdaq, trading of our common stock would most likely take place on an over-the-counter market established for unlisted securities, such as the OTCQB or the Pink Market maintained by OTC Markets Group Inc. An investor would likely find it less convenient to sell, or to obtain accurate quotations in seeking to buy, our common stock on an over-the-counter market, and many investors would likely not buy or sell our common stock due to difficulty in accessing over-the-counter markets, policies preventing them from trading in securities not listed on a national exchange or other reasons. In addition, as a delisted security, our common stock would be subject to SEC rules as a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d which impose additional disclosure requirements on broker-dealers. The regulations relating to penny stocks, coupled with the typically higher cost per trade to the investor of penny stocks due to factors such as broker commissions generally representing a higher percentage of the price of a penny stock than of a higher-priced stock, would further limit the ability of investors to trade in our common stock. For these reasons and others, delisting would adversely affect the liquidity, trading volume and price of our common stock, causing the value of an investment in us to decrease and having an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including our ability to attract and retain qualified employees, to raise capital, and execute on a strategic alternative.\nOur securities are now and have historically been thinly traded. An active trading market in our equity securities may cease to exist, which would adversely affect the market price and liquidity of our common stock, in addition our stock price has been subject to fluctuating prices.\nShares of our common stock are now and have been thinly traded, meaning that the number of persons interested in purchasing our common stock at or near ask prices at any given time may be relatively small or non-existent. As a consequence, our stock price may not reflect an actual or perceived value of the business. Also, there may be periods of several days or more when trading activity in our shares is minimal or non-existent, as compared to an issuer that has a large and steady volume of trading activity that will generally support continuous sales without an adverse effect on share price. We cannot predict the actions of market makers, investors or other market participants, and can offer no assurances that the market for our securities will be stable. If there is no active trading market in our equity securities, the market price and liquidity of the securities will be adversely affected. The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the market or the perception that these sales could occur. Due to these conditions, you may not be able to sell your shares at or near ask prices or at all if you need money or otherwise desire to liquidate your shares. These conditions also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate.\nWe have a number of policies in place that could be considered anti-takeover protections.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation (the \u201cCertificate\u201d) requires the approval of the holders of two-thirds of the outstanding shares to amend certain provisions of the Certificate. Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporate Law restricts the ability of a Delaware corporation to engage in any business combination with an interested shareholder. We are also authorized to issue up to 0.8 million shares of preferred stock, the rights of which may be fixed by our Board without shareholder approval. Provisions in certain of our executive officers' employment agreements provide for post-termination compensation, including payment of amounts up to two times their annual salary, following certain changes in control (as defined in such agreements). Our stock incentive plans provide for the acceleration of the vesting of options in the event of certain changes in control (as defined in such plans). Certain changes in control also constitute an event of default under our bank credit facility. The foregoing matters may, together or separately, have the effect of discouraging or making more difficult an acquisition or change of control of the company.", "PERMNO": 80587, "SIC": 8051, "TIC": "DVCR"}
