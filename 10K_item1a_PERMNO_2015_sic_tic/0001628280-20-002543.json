{"cik": "1364885", "company": "Spirit AeroSystems Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-28", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in our securities involves risks and uncertainties. The risks and uncertainties set forth below are those that we currently believe may materially and adversely affect us, our future business or results of operations, our industry, or investments in our securities. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of or that we currently deem immaterial may also materially and adversely affect us, our future business or results of operations, or investments in our securities.\nOur business depends, in large part, on sales of components for a single aircraft program, the B737 MAX. A continued grounding of the B737 MAX fleet and related suspensions or reductions in the B737 MAX production rate may have a material adverse impact on Spirit's business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Furthermore, the low rate of production creates financial and disruption risks for Spirit\u2019s suppliers on the B737 MAX program, which, may in turn, affect Spirit\u2019s ability to comply with contractual obligations.\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, approximately 53% of our net revenues were generated from sales of components to Boeing for the B737 aircraft. While we have entered into long-term supply agreements with Boeing to continue to provide components for the B737 for the life of the aircraft program, including commercial and the military P-8 derivatives, Boeing does not have any obligation to purchase components from us for any replacement for the B737 that is not a commercial derivative model as defined by the Sustaining Agreement. The contract is a requirements contract and Boeing can reduce the purchase volume at any time.\nIn March 2019, the B737 MAX fleet was grounded in the U.S. and internationally following the 2018 and 2019 accidents involving two B737 MAX aircraft. On April 5, 2019, Boeing announced that it would reduce its production rate of the B737 MAX aircraft from 52 to 42 aircraft per month. Subsequent to Boeing's announcement, we announced that, to minimize supply chain disruption, Spirit would maintain a B737 delivery rate of 52 shipsets per month, rather than proceeding to a rate of 57 shipsets per month during the 2019 year. All shipsets produced by Spirit in excess of Boeing's production rate would be deemed to be delivered to Boeing \"FOB\" at Spirit's facilities, which would trigger Boeing's payment obligations for the incremental shipsets.\nOn December 19, 2019, Boeing directed Spirit to stop all B737 MAX deliveries to Boeing effective January 1, 2020, due to Boeing\u2019s announced temporary suspension of B737 MAX production. Accordingly, Spirit suspended all B737 MAX production beginning on January 1, 2020.\nOn February 6, 2020, Boeing and Spirit entered into the 2020 MOA superseding the 2019 MOA between the parties (except for Sections 15 and 16). The 2020 MOA provides for Spirit to deliver to Boeing 216 B737 MAX shipsets in 2020. The production rate agreed for 2020 represents less than half of Spirit\u2019s B737 MAX annualized production rate in 2019. The Company does not expect to be back at a production rate of 52 aircraft per month until late 2022.\nWhile Spirit has taken actions to align its cost structure to the production suspension and 2020 production rate, including instructing its suppliers to stop delivering B737 MAX products throughout the suspension, implementing workforce actions, and reducing its quarterly dividend, the B737 MAX situation presents challenges to Spirit\u2019s liquidity. Spirit has fully drawn all $800 million of the Revolver (as defined below) to address critical issues that may arise and agreed to maintain minimum liquidity levels as required by the Company\u2019s Credit Agreement (as defined below) through the first quarter of 2021. If Boeing is unable to return the B737 MAX to service in one or more jurisdictions, begin timely deliveries to customers, or if production levels are reduced beyond current expectations due to depressed demand or otherwise, or if Spirit has difficulties in managing its cost structure\nto take into account changes in production schedules or to accommodate a ramp-up in production, Spirit\u2019s liquidity position may worsen absent Spirit\u2019s ability to procure additional financing, Spirit may trigger an event of default under its credit facilities, and Spirit\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely impacted. The need to fund the Asco Acquisition and the Bombardier Acquisition and related expenses could also adversely affect our liquidity.\nFurthermore, due to the production suspension and cost pressures, Spirit\u2019s suppliers may encounter financial difficulty and, absent financial support, may not be able to continue meeting commitments under their agreements with Spirit. If any of such suppliers supply critical parts to Spirit and Spirit is not able to secure timely and adequate replacement parts, Spirit may breach its obligations to Boeing under the Sustaining Agreement. In the event of a significant breach, Boeing has the ability to terminate the Sustaining Agreement and, in such an event, Spirit\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely impacted.\nBased on Boeing\u2019s public statements, we have assumed that regulatory approval will enable B737 MAX deliveries to resume no earlier than mid-2020. In the event of delays to this timeline and corresponding changes to our production rate, the Company may be required to take actions with longer-term impact, such as further changes to our production plans, employment reductions and/or the expenditure of significant resources to support our supply chain and/or Boeing. In addition, a delay to that timeline and corresponding changes to our production rate may cause us to default under our credit agreement.\nWe have made significant assumptions with respect to the B737 program regarding the number of units to be delivered in 2020 (216 units), the period during which those units are likely to be produced, and the units\u2019 expected sales prices, production costs, program tooling and other non-recurring costs, and routine warranty costs. In addition, we have made assumptions regarding estimated costs expected to be incurred until resuming a normal production rate consistent with 2019 production levels to determine which costs should be (i) included in program inventory and (ii) expensed when incurred as abnormal production costs. Any changes in these estimates and/or assumptions with respect to the B737 program could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, and/or cash flows.\nBecause we depend on Boeing and, to a lesser extent, Airbus, as our largest customers, our sales, cash flows from operations, and results of operations will be negatively affected if either Boeing or Airbus reduces the number of products it purchases from us or if either experiences business difficulties or breaches its obligations to us.\nCurrently, Boeing is our largest customer and Airbus is our second-largest customer. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, approximately 79% and 16% of our net revenues were generated from sales to Boeing and Airbus, respectively. Although our strategy is, in part, to diversify our customer base by entering into supply arrangements with additional customers, we cannot give any assurance that we will be successful in doing so. Even if we are successful in obtaining and retaining new customers, we expect that Boeing and, to a lesser extent, Airbus, will continue to account for a substantial portion of our sales for the foreseeable future. If either of these customers reduces the requirements under our agreements (as Boeing did in December 2019 when it directed Spirit to stop all B737 MAX deliveries to Boeing effective January 1, 2020), terminates or breaches our agreements, experiences a major disruption in its business, such as a strike, work stoppage, slowdown, or a supply chain problem, or experiences a deterioration in its business, financial condition, or liquidity, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nRequirement contracts with Airbus and Boeing generally do not require specific minimum purchase volumes and Boeing or Airbus, as applicable, can reduce the purchase volume at any time. In addition, if we breach or are unable to perform certain obligations under these supply agreements, Boeing or Airbus may terminate such agreements and/or seek damages from us, which could materially adversely affect our business. Boeing and Airbus also have the contractual right to cancel their supply agreements with us for convenience, which could include the termination of one or more aircraft models or programs for which we supply products. Although Boeing and Airbus would be required to reimburse us for certain expenses, there can be no assurance these payments would adequately cover our expenses or lost profits resulting from the termination. In addition, we have agreed to a limitation on recoverable damages if Boeing wrongfully terminates our main supply agreement with respect to any model or program. If this occurs, we may not be able to recover the full amount of our actual damages.\nOur business depends, in part, on securing work for replacement programs.\nWhile we have entered into long-term supply agreements with respect to the Sustaining Programs, Boeing does not have any obligation to purchase components from us for any subsequent variant of these aircraft that is not a commercial derivative as defined by the Sustaining Agreement. If we are unable to obtain significant aerostructures supply business for any aircraft program for which we provide significant content, such as the B737 MAX, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe operate in a very competitive business environment.\nAs Spirit seeks to further diversify its program portfolio and product offerings and expand its customer base, we face substantial competition from both OEMs and non-OEM aerostructures suppliers. OEMs may choose not to outsource production of aerostructures due to, among other things, their own direct labor and other overhead considerations and capacity utilization at their own facilities. Consequently, traditional factors affecting competition, such as price and quality of service, may not be significant determinants when OEMs decide whether to produce a part in-house or to outsource.\nFurther, some of our non-OEM competitors have greater resources than we do and, therefore, may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, or devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products than we can. Providers of aerostructures have traditionally competed on the basis of cost, technology, quality, and service. We believe that developing and maintaining a competitive advantage will require continued investment in product development, engineering, supply-chain management, and sales and marketing, and we may not have enough resources to make such investments.\nFurther, it is very difficult for new aerostructures suppliers to compete against incumbent suppliers for work under an existing contract. Once a contract is awarded, the OEM and the supplier are typically required to spend significant amounts of time and capital on design, manufacture, testing, and certification of tooling and other equipment. A supplier change would require further testing and certification and the expensive movement of existing tooling or the development of new tooling, and would likely result in production delays and additional costs to both the OEM and the new supplier. These high switching costs may make it more difficult for us to bid competitively against existing suppliers and less likely that an OEM will be willing to switch suppliers during the life of an aircraft program, which could materially adversely affect our ability to obtain new work on existing aircraft programs.\nFor these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully in this market or against our competitors, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business depends on our ability to maintain a healthy supply chain, meet production rate requirements, and timely deliver products that meet or exceed stringent quality standards.\nOur business depends on our ability to maintain a healthy supply chain, achieve planned production rate targets, and meet or exceed stringent performance and reliability standards. The supply chain for large commercial aerostructures is complex and involves hundreds of suppliers and their technical employees from all over the world.\nOperational issues, including delays or defects in supplier components, could result in significant out-of-sequence work and increased production costs, as well as delayed deliveries to customers. Our suppliers\u2019 failure to provide parts that meet our technical specifications could materially adversely affect production schedules and contract profitability. We may not be able to find acceptable alternatives, and any such alternatives could result in increased costs for us and possible forward losses on certain contracts. Even if acceptable alternatives are found, the process of locating and securing such alternatives might be disruptive to our business and might lead to termination of our supply agreements with our customers.\nIn order for us to keep the supply chain healthy, we must minimize disruption and production changes. The B737 MAX program has experienced significant disruption due to the production suspension. Many suppliers are distressed. If these suppliers cannot timely deliver components to us at the cost and rates necessary to achieve our targets, we may be unable to meet delivery schedules and/or the financial performance of the B737 MAX program may suffer.\nThe Company's ability to meet production rate increases is dependent upon several factors, including without limitation, expansion and alignment of its production facilities, tooling, and equipment; improved efficiencies in its production line; on-time delivery of component parts from the Company's suppliers; adequate supply of skilled labor; and implementation of customer customizations upon demand. If the Company fails to meet the quality or delivery expectations or requirements of its customers, disruptions in manufacturing lines could result, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company's ability to meet commitments to its customers and on its future financial results.\nIn some cases, in order to meet these increases in production rates, we will need to make significant capital expenditures to expand our capacity and improve our performance or find alternative solutions such as outsourcing some of our existing work to free up additional capacity. While some of these expenditures will be reimbursed by our customers, we could be required to bear a significant portion of the costs. In addition, the increases in production rates could cause disruptions in our manufacturing lines, which could materially adversely impact our ability to meet our commitments to our customers, and have a resulting adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nInterruptions in deliveries of components or raw materials, or increased prices for components or raw materials used in our products could delay production and/or materially adversely affect our financial performance, profitability, margins, and revenues.\nWe are highly dependent on the availability of essential materials and purchased components from our suppliers, some of which are available only from a sole source or limited sources. Our dependency upon regular deliveries from particular suppliers of components and raw materials means that interruptions or stoppages in such deliveries could materially adversely affect our operations until arrangements with alternate suppliers, to the extent alternate suppliers exist, could be made. If any of our suppliers were unable or were to refuse to deliver materials to us for an extended period of time, or if we were unable to negotiate acceptable terms for the supply of materials with these or alternative suppliers, our business could suffer and be materially affected.\nOur continued supply of materials is subject to a number of risks including:\n\u2022\nthe destruction of or damage to our suppliers\u2019 facilities or their distribution infrastructure;\n\u2022\nembargoes, force majeure events, domestic or international acts of hostility, terrorism, or other events impacting our suppliers\u2019 ability to perform;\n\u2022\na work stoppage or strike by our suppliers\u2019 employees;\n\u2022\nthe failure of our suppliers to provide materials of the requisite quality or in compliance with specifications;\n\u2022\nthe failure of essential equipment at our suppliers\u2019 plants;\n\u2022\nthe failure of our suppliers to satisfy U.S. and international import and export control laws for goods that we purchase from such suppliers;\n\u2022\nthe failure of our suppliers to meet regulatory standards;\n\u2022\nthe failure, shortage. or delay in the delivery of raw materials to our suppliers;\n\u2022\nimposition of tariffs and similar import limitations on us or our suppliers;\n\u2022\ncontractual amendments and disputes with our suppliers; and\n\u2022\nthe inability of our suppliers to perform as a result of global economic conditions or otherwise.\nIn addition, our profitability is affected by the prices of the components and raw materials, such as titanium, aluminum, steel, and carbon fiber, used in the manufacturing of our products. These prices may fluctuate based on a number of factors beyond our control, including world oil prices, changes in supply and demand, general economic conditions, labor costs, competition, import duties, tariffs, currency exchange rates and, in some cases, government regulation. Although our supply agreements with Boeing and Airbus allow us to pass on to our customers certain unusual increases in component and raw material costs in limited situations, we may not be fully compensated by the customers for the entirety of any such increased costs.\nOur operations depend on our ability to maintain continuing, uninterrupted production at our manufacturing facilities and our suppliers\u2019 facilities. Our production facilities and our suppliers\u2019 facilities are subject to physical and other risks that could disrupt production.\nOur manufacturing facilities or our suppliers\u2019 manufacturing facilities could be damaged or disrupted by a natural disaster, war, terrorist activity, interruption of utilities, public health crises, or sustained mechanical failure. Although we have obtained property damage and business interruption insurance where appropriate, a sustained mechanical failure of a key piece of equipment, major catastrophe (such as a fire, flood, tornado, hurricane, major snow storm, or other natural disaster), war, or terrorist activities in any of the areas where we or our suppliers conduct operations could result in a prolonged interruption of all or a substantial portion of our business. Any disruption resulting from these events could cause significant delays in shipments of products and the loss of sales and customers and we may not have insurance to adequately compensate us for any of these events. A large portion of our operations takes place at one facility in Wichita, Kansas and any significant damage or disruption to this facility in particular would materially adversely affect our ability to service our customers.\nThe Company maintains broad insurance coverage for both property damage and business interruption where appropriate. While the Company expects the insurance proceeds would be sufficient to cover most of the business interruption expenses, certain deductibles and limitations will apply and no assurance can be made that all recovery costs will be covered.\nOur commercial business is cyclical and sensitive to commercial airlines\u2019 profitability.\nWe compete in the aerostructures segment of the aerospace industry. Our customers\u2019 business, and therefore our own, is directly affected by the financial condition of commercial airlines and other economic factors, including global economic conditions and geopolitical considerations that affect the demand for air transportation. Specifically, our commercial business is dependent on the demand from passenger airlines and cargo carriers for the production of new aircraft. Accordingly, demand for our commercial products is tied to the worldwide airline industry\u2019s ability to finance the purchase of new aircraft and the industry\u2019s forecasted demand for seats, flights, routes, and cargo capacity. Availability of financing to non-U.S. customers depends in part on the continued operations of the U.S. Export-Import Bank. Additionally, the size and age of the worldwide commercial aircraft fleet affects the demand for new aircraft and, consequently, for our products. Such factors, in conjunction with evolving economic\nconditions, cause the market in which we operate to be cyclical to varying degrees, thereby affecting our business and operating results.\nLegal or regulatory proceedings related to the review of accounting process compliance may result in significant costs and expenses and divert resources from our operations and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOn January 30, 2020, the Company issued a press release regarding an independent review by our audit committee of our accounting process compliance (the \u201cAccounting Review\u201d). As a result of the Accounting Review, the Company determined that it did not comply with its established accounting processes with respect to certain potential contingent liabilities received by the Company after the end of the third quarter of 2019. The Accounting Review is now substantially complete.\nAfter conducting the appropriate accounting processes with respect to the potential contingent liabilities, the Company concluded that it should have recorded an incremental contingent liability of less than $8.0 million for the three month period ending September 26, 2019. We do not believe this amount is material, either quantitatively or qualitatively, to our consolidated financial statements as of and for the three-month period ending September 26, 2019. Although this matter did not result in a material misstatement of the Company\u2019s third quarter 2019 consolidated financial statements or any other previously issued financial statements, the non-compliance led us to conclude that a material weakness in our internal control existed as of December 31, 2019. Additional information on this material weakness is described under Item 9A \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nPrior to the Company\u2019s January 30, 2020 announcement, the Company voluntarily reported the Accounting Review to the SEC. The Company has communicated to the SEC that the Accounting Review is substantially complete. In the event the SEC commences an investigation with respect to these matters, the Company intends to cooperate fully.\nTwo private securities class action lawsuits relating to these matters were filed against the Company, its Chief Executive Officer and former officers in February 2020. There may be additional lawsuits filed, including shareholder derivative actions, purportedly in the name and for the benefit of the Company. The Company intends to vigorously defend the existing lawsuits, and any other related litigation against the Company.\nAs a result of any legal or regulatory proceedings related to the Accounting Review, we may incur significant professional fees and other costs. If we are unsuccessful in any action related to this matter, we may be required to pay a significant amount of monetary damages that may be in excess of our insurance coverage. The SEC also could impose other sanctions against us or our directors and officers, including injunctions, a cease and desist order, fines and other equitable remedies. In addition, our Board of Directors, management and employees may expend a substantial amount of time on these legal and regulatory proceedings and investigations, diverting resources and attention that would otherwise be directed toward our operations and implementation of our business strategy. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur management has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting were not effective as of December 31, 2019, and that we have a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. If not remediated, our failure to establish and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements or a failure to meet our reporting and financial obligations, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and the trading price of our common stock.\nIn connection with the Accounting Review discussed herein, the Company concluded that a material weakness existed in its internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. See Item 9A \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSOX\u201d) and the related SEC rules requires management to assess the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures and to include in this Annual Report on Form 10-K a management report on that assessment. An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our audit committee and management, including our President and Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and Senior Vice-President and Chief Financial Officer (principal financial officer), on the design and operating effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, and based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of December 31, 2019, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at a reasonable assurance level as a result of a material weakness we identified with respect to our internal control over financial reporting.\nAs a result, we have taken steps to improve our internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures, including through (i) management changes, (ii) enhanced training, and , and (iii) validation regarding the application of existing policies and procedures, including direct and timely confirmation and consideration of outstanding claims by key customers. Although we have taken such steps, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in making the improvements necessary to remediate our material weakness or disclosure control and procedure ineffectiveness, that we will do so in a timely manner, or that we will not identify additional control deficiencies or material weaknesses in the future. We expect the remediation plan to extend over multiple financial reporting periods in 2020. If we are not successful in making the improvements, or if we have additional control deficiencies, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately, prevent fraud, or file our periodic reports with the SEC in a timely manner, which may expose us to legal and regulatory liabilities and may cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and may lead to a decline in the market price of our common stock. In addition, implementing any appropriate changes to our internal controls may distract our officers and employees and/or entail substantial costs.\nThe Company's results could be adversely affected by economic and geopolitical considerations.\nThe commercial airline industry is impacted by the strength of the global economy and the geopolitical events around the world. Possible exogenous shocks such as expanding conflicts or political unrest in the Middle East or Asia, renewed terrorist attacks against the industry, or pandemic health crises (such as the Coronavirus or viruses similar to SARs and MERS) have the potential to cause precipitous declines in air traffic. Any protracted economic slump, adverse credit market conditions, future terrorist attacks, war, or health concerns could cause airlines to cancel or delay the purchase of additional new aircraft, which could result in a deterioration of commercial airplane backlogs. If demand for new aircraft decreases, there would likely be a decrease in demand for our commercial aircraft products, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nChanges in the United Kingdom\u2019s economic and other relationships with the European Union could adversely affect the Company. There continues to be substantial uncertainty regarding the economic impact of the United Kingdom's departure from the European Union (\"EU\") on January 31, 2020 (referred to as \"Brexit\"). The UK and EU are currently in a transition (implementation) period that is due to end on December 31, 2020. The ultimate effects of Brexit on the Company (currently, and as expanded upon completion of the Bombardier Acquisition) are difficult to predict, but because the Company currently operates and conducts business in the United Kingdom and in Europe, potential adverse consequences of Brexit such as global market uncertainty, volatility in currency exchange rates, greater restrictions on imports and exports between the UK and other countries and increased regulatory complexities could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Adverse economic conditions may decrease our customers' demand for our products and services or impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and services they have purchased. As a result, our sales could decrease and reserves for our credit losses and write-offs of receivables may increase. In addition, Brexit could result in legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as new legal relationships between the United Kingdom and the European Union are established. The ultimate effects of Brexit on the Company will also depend on the terms of any agreements the United Kingdom and the European Union make to retain access to each other\u2019s respective markets either during a transitional period or more permanently.\nWe are pursuing growth opportunities in a number of newly developed and emerging markets. These investments may expose us to heightened risks of economic, geopolitical, or other events, including governmental takeover (i.e., nationalization) of our manufacturing facilities or intellectual property, restrictive exchange or import controls, disruption of operations as a result of systemic political or economic instability, outbreak of war or expansion of hostilities, and acts of terrorism, each of which could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Further, the U.S. government, other governments, and international organizations could impose additional sanctions that could restrict us from doing business directly or indirectly in or with certain countries or parties, which could include affiliates.\nWe face risks as we work to successfully execute on new or maturing programs.\nNew or maturing programs with new technologies typically carry risks associated with design responsibility, development of new production tools, hiring and training of qualified personnel, increased capital and funding commitments, ability to meet customer specifications, delivery schedules, and unique contractual requirements, supplier performance, ability of the customer to meet its contractual obligations to us, and our ability to accurately estimate costs associated with such programs. In addition, any new or maturing aircraft program may not generate sufficient demand or may experience technological problems or significant delays in the regulatory certification or manufacturing and delivery schedule. If we were unable to perform our obligations under new or maturing programs to the customer\u2019s satisfaction or manufacture products at our estimated costs, if we were to experience unexpected fluctuations in raw material prices or supplier problems leading to cost overruns, if we were unable to successfully perform under revised design and manufacturing plans or successfully resolve claims and assertions, or if a new or maturing program in which we had made a significant investment was terminated or experienced weak demand, delays or technological problems could result and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Some of these risks have affected our maturing programs to the extent that we have recorded significant forward losses and maintain\ncertain of our maturing programs at zero or low margins due to our inability to overcome the effects of these risks. We continue to face similar risks as well as the potential for default, quality problems, or inability to meet weight requirements and these could result in continued zero or low margins or additional forward losses, and the risk of having to write-off additional inventory if it were deemed to be unrecoverable over the life of the program. In addition, beginning new work on existing programs also carries risks associated with the transfer of technology, knowledge, and tooling.\nIn order to perform on new or maturing programs we may be required to construct or acquire new facilities requiring additional up-front investment costs. In the case of significant program delays and/or program cancellations, we could be required to bear certain unrecoverable construction and maintenance costs and incur potential impairment charges for the new facilities. Also, we may need to expend additional resources to determine an alternate revenue-generating use for the facilities. Likewise, significant delays in the construction or acquisition of a plant site could impact production schedules.\nWe use estimates in accounting for revenue and cost for our contracts. Changes in our estimates could adversely affect our future financial performance.\nThe Company recognizes revenue using the principles of Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606 and estimates revenue and cost for contracts that span a period of multiple years. This method of accounting requires judgment on a number of underlying assumptions to develop our estimates such as favorable trends in volume, learning curve efficiencies, and future pricing from suppliers that reduce our production costs. However, several factors may cause the costs we incur in fulfilling these contracts to vary substantially from our original estimates such as technical problems, delivery reductions, materials shortages, supplier difficulties, and multiple other events. Other than certain increases in raw material costs that can generally be passed on to our customers, in most instances we must fully absorb cost overruns. Due to the significant length of time over which some revenue streams are generated, the variability of future period estimated revenue and cost may be adversely affected if circumstances or underlying assumptions change. If our estimated costs exceed our estimated revenues under a fixed-price contract, we will be required to recognize a forward loss on the affected program, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. The risk particularly applies to products such as the B787 and A350, in that our performance at the contracted price depends on our being able to achieve production cost reductions as we gain production experience.\nFurther, some of our long-term supply agreements, such as the Sustaining Agreement and the B787 Agreement, provide for the re-negotiation of established pricing terms at specified times in the future. If such negotiations result in costs that exceed our revenue under a fixed-price contract, or operating margins that our lower than our current margins, we may need to recognize a forward loss on the affected program, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nAdditionally, variability of future period estimated revenue and cost may result in recording additional valuation allowances against future deferred tax assets, which could adversely affect our future financial performance.\nProlonged periods of inflation where we do not have adequate inflation protections in our customer contracts could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nA majority of our sales are conducted pursuant to long-term contracts that set fixed unit prices. Certain, but not all, of these contracts provide for price adjustments for inflation or abnormal escalation. Although we have attempted to minimize the effect of inflation on our business through contractual protections, the presence of longer pricing periods within our contracts increases the likelihood that there will be sustained or higher than anticipated increases in costs of labor or material. Furthermore, if one of the raw materials on which we are dependent (e.g. aluminum, titanium, or composite material) were to experience an isolated price increase without inflationary impacts on the broader economy, we may not be entitled to inflation protection under certain of our contracts. If our contractual protections do not adequately protect us in the context of substantial cost increases, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur business could be materially adversely affected by product warranty obligations or defective product claims.\nWe are exposed to liabilities that are unique to the products and services we provide. Our operations expose us to potential liabilities for warranty or other claims with respect to aircraft components that have been designed, manufactured, or serviced by us or our suppliers. We maintain insurance for certain risks. The amount of our insurance coverage may not cover all claims or liabilities and we may be forced to bear substantial costs. Material obligations in excess of our insurance coverage (or other third party indemnification) could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn addition, if our products are found to be defective and lacking in quality, or if one of our products causes an accident, our reputation could be damaged and our ability to retain and attract customers could be materially adversely affected.\nIn order to be successful, we must attract, retain, train, motivate, develop and transition key employees, and failure to do so could harm our business.\nIn order to be successful, we must attract, retain, train, motivate, develop, and transition qualified executives and other key employees, including those in managerial, manufacturing, and engineering positions. Competition for experienced employees in the aerospace industry, and in particular in Wichita, Kansas, where the majority of our manufacturing and executive offices are located, is intense. The failure to successfully hire executives and key employees or the loss of any executives and key employees could have a significant impact on our operations. Further, changes in our management team may be disruptive to our business and any failure to successfully transition and assimilate key new hires or promoted employees could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nFurther, in January 2020, the Company announced significant workforce reductions to assist with alleviating costs relating to B737 MAX production. The Company\u2019s ability to ramp up in rate on the B737 MAX program after re-certification will depend, in part, on the Company\u2019s ability to hire key employees to fill any gaps left by the workforce reductions. If the Company is unable to hire such key employees, B737 MAX production could be adversely impacted.\nIn addition, the Company\u2019s operations and strategy require that we employ a critical mass of highly skilled employees with industry experience and engineering, technical, or mechanical skills. As the Company experiences an increase in retirements, the level of skill replacing our experienced workers is being impacted due to the availability of skilled labor in the market and low unemployment rates. Talent is being replaced with less experienced talent and the organization is having to develop internal resources to meet the talent gap. We continue to work with learning institutions to develop programs to attract and train new talent. Our inability to attract and retain skilled employees may adversely impact our ability to meet our customers\u2019 expectations, the cost and schedule of development projects, and the cost and efficiency of existing operations.\nThe profitability of certain programs depends significantly on the assumptions surrounding satisfactory settlement of customer claims and assertions.\nFor certain of our programs, we regularly commence work or incorporate customer requested changes prior to negotiating pricing terms for engineering work or the product that has been modified. We typically have the contractual right to negotiate pricing for customer directed changes. In those cases, we assert to our customers our contractual rights to obtain the additional revenue or cost reimbursement we expect to receive upon finalizing pricing terms. An expected recovery value of these assertions is incorporated into our contract profitability estimates. Our inability to recover these expected values, among other factors, could result in the recognition of a forward loss on these programs and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s proposed and future acquisitions expose us to risks, including the risk that we may not be able to successfully integrate these businesses or achieve expected operating synergies.\nThe Company is currently pursuing the following acquisitions: (i) on May 1, 2018, the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary Spirit AeroSystems Belgium Holdings BVBA (\u201cSpirit Belgium\u201d) entered into a definitive agreement with certain private sellers pursuant to which Spirit Belgium will purchase all of the issued and outstanding equity of S.R.I.F. N.V., the parent company of Asco Industries N.V. (\u201cAsco\u201d), subject to certain customary closing adjustments, for cash consideration (as amended) of $420 million (the \u201cAsco Acquisition\u201d); and (ii) on October 31, 2019, Spirit and Spirit AeroSystems Global Holdings Limited (\u201cSpirit UK\u201d), wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company, entered into a definitive agreement with Bombardier Inc., Bombardier Aerospace UK Limited, Bombardier Finance Inc., and Bombardier Services Corporation pursuant to which, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, Spirit UK will acquire the outstanding equity of Short Brothers plc and Bombardier Aerospace North Africa SAS, and Spirit will acquire substantially all the assets of the maintenance, repair and overhaul business in Dallas, Texas (collectively, the \u201cBombardier Acquired Businesses\u201d) for cash consideration of $500 million (the \u201cBombardier Acquisition\u201d).\nThe Asco Acquisition, the Bombardier Acquisition, and any future acquisitions are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nwe may not obtain required regulatory approvals or receipt of regulatory approvals may take longer than expected, regulators may impose conditions to the proposed acquisitions that are not presently anticipated or cannot be met;\n\u2022\nconditions precedent to the proposed acquisitions may not be fulfilled in a timely manner or at all; and\n\u2022\nunforeseen events and events beyond our control.\nWe have incurred and expect to incur transaction and acquisition-related costs associated with these acquisitions. These, as well as other unanticipated costs and expenses, could have an impact on our financial condition and operating results. Combining our businesses may be more difficult, costly, or time consuming than expected. In addition, events outside of our control, including changes in regulation and laws as well as economic trends, could adversely affect our ability to realize the expected benefits from the acquisition. Further, the Asco Acquisition and the Bombardier Acquisition are not subject to financing contingencies. To the extent the Company is unable to raise additional financing to fund the acquisitions, or negotiate alternative arrangements, the Company's ability to consummate the acquisitions could be hindered. In addition, the need to fund these acquisitions and related expenses may adversely affect our liquidity.\nThe success of the proposed acquisitions will depend on, among other things, our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from combining our and Asco's and Bombardier's businesses in a manner that facilitates growth opportunities and realizes anticipated synergies and cost savings. These anticipated benefits and cost savings may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected or could have other adverse effects that we do not currently foresee. Further, the integration of these companies involves a number of risks, including, but not limited to the diversion of management\u2019s attention from the management of daily operations to the integration of operations, difficulties in the assimilation of different cultures and practices, as well as in the assimilation of geographically dispersed operations and personnel, who may speak different languages, difficulties in the integration of departments, systems (including accounting, production, ERP, and IT systems), technologies, books and records and procedures, as well as in maintaining uniform standards, controls (including internal accounting controls), procedures, and policies and compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and other applicable anti-bribery laws.\nAs part of the Bombardier Acquisition, the Company has agreed to assume net pension liabilities of approximately $300 million as reflected at the date of the Purchase Agreement. The downgrades to the Company\u2019s credit ratings and liquidity pressures referenced herein may result in the pension liabilities being recalculated prior to the closing of the Bombardier Acquisition. If the liabilities are recalculated, the assumed liability amount could increase.\nWe do not own most of the intellectual property and tooling used in our business.\nOur business depends on using certain intellectual property and tooling that we have rights to use under license grants from our customers. If these licenses are terminated due to a default or otherwise, our business may be materially affected. In addition, we license some of the intellectual property needed for performance under some of our supply contracts from our customers under those supply agreements. We must honor our contractual commitments to our customers related to intellectual property and comply with infringement laws governing our use of intellectual property. In the event we obtain new business from new or existing customers, we will need to pay particular attention to these contractual commitments and any other restrictions on our use of intellectual property to make sure that we will not be using intellectual property improperly in the performance of such new business. In the event we use any such intellectual property improperly, we could be subject to an infringement or misappropriation claim by the owner or licensee of such intellectual property.\nIn the future, our entry into new markets may require obtaining additional license grants from our customers. If we are unable to negotiate additional license rights on acceptable terms (or at all) from these customers, our ability to enter new markets may be restricted. In addition, we may be subject to restrictions in future licenses granted to us that may materially restrict our use of third party intellectual property.\nOur success depends in part on the success of our research and development initiatives.\nIn order for us to remain competitive, we will need to expend significant capital to research and develop technologies, purchase new equipment and machines, or to train our employees in the new methods of production and service. We spent $54.5 million on research and development during the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. Our expenditures on our research and development efforts may not create any new sales opportunities or increases in productivity that are commensurate with the level of resources invested.\nWe are in the process of developing specific technologies and capabilities in pursuit of new business and in anticipation of customers going forward with new programs. If any such programs do not go forward or are not successful, or if we are unable to generate sufficient new business, we may be unable to recover the costs incurred in anticipation of such programs or business and our profitability and revenues may be materially adversely affected.\nWhile the Company intends to continue committing financial resources and effort to the development of innovative new technologies, any strain on the Company\u2019s liquidity, such as the strain caused by the B737 MAX production suspension and lower 2020 production rate, will reduce the Company\u2019s ability to expend capital to develop such technologies.\nWe could be required to make future contributions to our defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefit plans as a result of adverse changes in interest rates and the capital markets.\nOur estimates of liabilities and expenses for pensions and other post-retirement benefits incorporate significant assumptions including the rate used to discount the future estimated liability, the long-term rate of return on plan assets, and several assumptions relating to the employee workforce (salary increases, medical costs, retirement age, and mortality). A dramatic decrease in the fair value of our plan assets resulting from movements in the financial markets or a decrease in discount rates may cause the status of our plans to go from an over-funded status to an under-funded status and result in cash funding requirements to meet any minimum required funding levels. Our results of operations, liquidity, or shareholders\u2019 equity in a particular period could be affected by a decline in the rate of return on plan assets, the rate used to discount the future estimated liability, or changes in employee workforce assumptions.\nWe derive a significant portion of our net revenues from direct and indirect sales outside the U.S. and are subject to the risks of doing business in foreign countries.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from sales by Boeing and Airbus to customers outside the U.S. In addition, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, direct sales to our non-U.S. customers accounted for approximately 16% of our net revenues. We expect that our and our customers\u2019 international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our net revenues for the foreseeable future. As a result, we are subject to risks of doing business internationally, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\ndomestic and foreign government policies, including requirements to expend a portion of program funds locally and governmental industrial cooperation requirements;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\ncompliance with foreign labor laws, which generally provide for increased notice, severance and consultation requirements compared to U.S. laws;\n\u2022\ndifficulties enforcing intellectual property and contractual rights in certain jurisdictions;\n\u2022\nthe complexity and necessity of using foreign representatives and consultants;\n\u2022\nuncertainties and restrictions concerning the availability of funding credit or guarantees;\n\u2022\ntariffs (imposed or threatened) on imports, including tariffs imposed in a retaliatory manner on U.S. exports, embargoes, export controls, and other trade restrictions or barriers;\n\u2022\npotential or actual withdrawal or modification of international trade agreements;\n\u2022\nmodifications to sanctions imposed on other countries;\n\u2022\nchanges to immigration policies that may present risks to companies that rely on foreign employees or contractors;\n\u2022\ncompliance with antitrust and competition regulations;\n\u2022\ndifferences in business practices;\n\u2022\nthe difficulty of management and operation of an enterprise spread over various countries;\n\u2022\ncompliance with a variety of foreign laws, as well as U.S. laws affecting the activities of U.S. companies abroad, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and other applicable anti-bribery laws; and\n\u2022\neconomic and geopolitical developments and conditions, including domestic or international hostilities, acts of terrorism and governmental reactions, inflation, trade relationships, and military and political alliances.\nWhile these factors and the effect of these factors are difficult to predict, adverse developments in one or more of these areas could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations in the future.\nThe outcome of litigation and of government inquiries and investigations involving our business is unpredictable and an adverse decision in any such matter could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nWe are involved in a number of litigation matters. These claims may divert financial and management resources that would otherwise be used to benefit our operations. No assurances can be given that the results of these matters will be favorable to us. An adverse resolution of any of these lawsuits could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations. In addition, we are sometimes subject to government inquiries and investigations of our business due, among other things, to the heavily regulated nature of our industry and our participation on government programs. Any such inquiry or investigation could potentially result in an adverse ruling against us, which could have a material impact on our financial position and operating results.\nIncreases in labor costs, potential labor disputes, and work stoppages at our facilities or the facilities of our suppliers or customers could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nOur financial performance is affected by the availability of qualified personnel and the cost of labor. A majority of our workforce is represented by unions. If our workers were to engage in a strike, work stoppage, or other slowdown, we could experience a significant disruption of our operations, which could cause us to be unable to deliver products to our customers on a timely basis and could result in a breach of our supply agreements. This could result in a loss of business and an increase in our operating expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, our non-unionized labor force may become subject to labor union organizing efforts, which could cause us to incur additional labor costs and increase the related risks that we now face.\nDue to the receipt of occasional government incentives, we have certain commitments to keep our programs in their current locations. This may prevent us from being able to offer our products at prices that are competitive in the marketplace and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate new business.\nIn addition, many aircraft manufacturers, airlines, and aerospace suppliers have unionized work forces. Any strikes, work stoppages, or slowdowns experienced by aircraft manufacturers, airlines, or aerospace suppliers could reduce our customers\u2019 demand for additional aircraft structures or prevent us from completing production of our aircraft structures.\nThe U.S. Government is a significant customer of certain of our customers and we and they are subject to specific U.S. Government contracting rules and regulations.\nWe provide aerostructures to defense aircraft manufacturers (\"defense customers\"). Our defense customers' businesses, and by extension, our business, is affected by the U.S. Government's continued commitment to programs under contract with our customers. Contracts with the U.S. Government generally permit the government to terminate contracts partially or completely, with or without cause, at any time. An unexpected termination of a significant government contract, a reduction in expenditures by the U.S. Government for aircraft using our products, lower margins resulting from increasingly competitive procurement policies, a reduction in the volume of contracts awarded to us, or substantial cost overruns could materially reduce our cash flow and results of operations. We bear the potential risk that the U.S. Government may unilaterally suspend our defense customers or us from new contracts pending the resolution of alleged violations of procurement laws or regulations.\nA decline in the U.S. defense budget or change of funding priorities may reduce demand for our defense customers' aircraft and reduce our sales of defense products. The U.S. defense budget has fluctuated in recent years, at times resulting in reduced demand for new aircraft. Changes in military strategy and priorities, or reductions in defense spending, may affect current and future funding of these programs and could reduce the demand for our defense customers' products, and thereby reduce sales of our defense products, which could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur business may be materially adversely affected if we lose our government, regulatory or industry approvals, if we lose our facility security clearances, if more stringent government regulations are enacted, or if industry oversight is increased.\nThe FAA prescribes standards and qualification requirements for aerostructures, including virtually all commercial airline and general aviation products, and licenses component repair stations within the U.S. comparable agencies, such as the EASA in Europe, regulate these matters in other countries. If we fail to qualify for or obtain a required license for one of our products or services or lose a qualification or license previously granted, the sale of the subject product or service would be prohibited by law until such license is obtained or renewed and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In addition, designing new products to meet existing regulatory requirements and retrofitting installed products to comply with new regulatory requirements can be expensive and time consuming.\nA facility security clearance (\u201cFCL\u201d) is required for a company to be awarded and perform on classified contracts for the Department of Defense (\u201cDOD\u201d) and certain other agencies of the U.S. Government. If we were to violate the terms and requirements of the NISPOM or any other applicable U.S. Government industrial security regulations, we could lose our FCLs. We cannot give any assurance that we will be able to maintain our FCLs. If for some reason our FCLs is invalidated or terminated, we may not be able to continue to perform under our classified contracts in effect at that time, and we would not be able to enter into new classified contracts, which could adversely affect our revenues.\nFrom time to time, government agencies propose new regulations or changes to existing regulations. These changes or new regulations generally increase the costs of compliance. To the extent the agencies implement regulatory changes, we may incur significant additional costs to achieve compliance.\nIn addition, certain aircraft repair activities we intend to engage in may require the approval of the aircraft\u2019s OEM. Our inability to obtain OEM approval could materially restrict our ability to perform such aircraft repair activities.\nOur business is subject to regulation in the U.S. and internationally.\nThe manufacturing of our products is subject to numerous federal, state, and foreign governmental regulations. The number of laws and regulations that are being enacted or proposed by various governmental bodies and authorities are increasing. Compliance with these regulations is difficult and expensive. If we fail to adhere, or are alleged to have failed to adhere, to any applicable federal, state, or foreign laws or regulations, or if such laws or regulations negatively affect sales of our products, our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows may be adversely affected. In addition, our future results could be adversely affected by changes in applicable federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations, or the interpretation or enforcement thereof, including those relating to manufacturing processes, product liability, government contracts, trade rules and customs regulations, intellectual property, consumer laws, privacy laws, as well as accounting standards and taxation requirements (including tax-rate changes, new tax laws, or revised tax law interpretations).\nWe are subject to environmental, health, and safety regulations and our ongoing operations may expose us to related liabilities.\nOur operations are subject to extensive regulation under environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations in the U.S. and other countries in which we operate. We may be subject to potentially significant fines or penalties, including criminal sanctions, if we fail to comply with these requirements. We have made, and will continue to make, significant capital and other expenditures to comply with these laws and regulations. We cannot predict with certainty what environmental legislation will be enacted in the future or how existing laws will be administered or interpreted. Our operations involve the use of large amounts of hazardous substances and regulated materials and generate many types of wastes, including emissions of hexavalent chromium and volatile organic compounds, and greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide. Spills and releases of these materials may subject us to clean-up liability for remediation and claims of alleged personal injury, property damage, and damage to natural resources, and we may become obligated to reduce our emissions of hexavalent chromium, volatile organic compounds and/or greenhouse gases. We cannot give any assurance that the aggregate amount of future remediation costs and other environmental liabilities will not be material.\nIn connection with prior acquisitions, we are indemnified or insured, subject to certain contractual limitations and conditions, for certain clean-up costs and other losses, liabilities, expenses, and claims related to existing environmental conditions on the acquired properties. If indemnification or insurance is not sufficient to cover any potential environmental liability, we may be required to make material expenditures.\nIn the future, contamination may be discovered at or emanating from our facilities or at off-site locations where we send waste. The remediation of such newly discovered contamination, related claims for personal injury or damages, or the enactment of new laws or a stricter interpretation of existing laws, may require us to make additional expenditures, some of which could be material. See \u201cBusiness - Regulatory Matters.\u201d\nIn addition, increased concern over climate change has led to new and proposed legislative and regulatory initiatives. New or revised laws and regulations in this area could directly and indirectly affect the Company, its customers, or its suppliers by increasing production costs or otherwise impacting operations. Compliance with any new or more stringent laws or regulations, or stricter interpretations of existing laws, could require additional expenditures by the Company and could have an adverse effect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to regulation of our technical data and goods under U.S. export control laws.\nAs a manufacturer and exporter of defense and dual-use technical data and commodities, we are subject to U.S. laws and regulations governing international trade and exports, including, but not limited to, the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, administered by the U.S. Department of State, and the Export Administration Regulations, administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce. Collaborative agreements that we may have with foreign persons, including manufacturers and suppliers, are also subject to U.S. export control laws. In addition, we are subject to trade sanctions against embargoed countries, which are administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control within the U.S. Department of the Treasury.\nA determination that we have failed to comply with one or more of these export controls or trade sanctions could result in civil or criminal penalties, including the imposition of fines upon us as well as the denial of export privileges and debarment from participation in U.S. government contracts. Additionally, restrictions may be placed on the export of technical data and goods in the future as a result of changing geopolitical conditions. Any one or more of such sanctions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are required to comply with \u201cconflict minerals\u201d rules promulgated by the SEC, which impose costs on us, may make our supply chain more complex, and could adversely impact our business.\nWe are subject to annual due diligence, disclosure, and reporting requirements as a company that manufactures or contracts to manufacture products that contain certain minerals and metals known as \u201cconflict minerals.\u201d We have, and expect to continue to, incur additional costs and expenses, in order to comply with these rules, including for due diligence to determine whether conflict minerals are necessary to the functionality or production of any of our products and, if so, to verify the sources of such conflict minerals; and to implement any changes we deem necessary to our products, processes, or sources of supply as a result of such diligence and verification activities. Compliance with these rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply, and pricing of materials used in certain of our products. As there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering conflict minerals from sources outside of the Democratic Republic of Congo or adjoining countries, or that have been independently verified as not funding armed conflict in those countries, we cannot assure that we will be able to obtain such verified minerals from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Since our supply chain is complex, we may not ultimately be able to sufficiently verify the origin of the conflict minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement, which may adversely affect our reputation with our customers, stockholders, and other stakeholders. In such event, we may also face difficulties in satisfying customers who require that all of the components in our products be certified as \u201cconflict free.\u201d If we are not able to\nmeet such requirements, customers may choose to disqualify us as a supplier, which may require us to write off inventory that cannot be sold. Any one or a combination of these factors could harm our business, reduce market demand for our products, and adversely affect our profit margins, net sales, and overall financial results. We may face similar risks in connection with any other regulations focusing on social responsibility or ethical sourcing that may be adopted in the future.\nWe could be materially adversely affected by high fuel prices.\nDue to the competitive nature of the airline industry, airlines are often unable to pass on increased fuel prices to customers by increasing fares. Fluctuations in the global supply of crude oil and the possibility of changes in government policy on jet fuel production, transportation, and marketing make it difficult to predict the future availability and price of jet fuel. In the event there is an outbreak or escalation of hostilities or other conflicts, or significant disruptions in oil production or delivery in oil-producing areas or elsewhere, there could be reductions in the production or importation of crude oil and significant increases in the cost of fuel. If there were major reductions in the availability of jet fuel or significant increases in its cost, the airline industry and, as a result, our business, could be materially adversely affected.\nOur operations could be negatively impacted by service interruptions, data corruption or misuse, cyber-based attacks, or network security breaches.\nWe rely on information technology networks and systems to manage and support a variety of business activities, including procurement and supply chain, engineering support, and manufacturing. These networks and systems, some of which are managed by third-parties, are susceptible to damage, disruptions, or shutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components thereof, power outages, hardware failures, computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers or insiders, telecommunication failures, user errors, or catastrophic events. If these networks and systems suffer severe damage, disruption, or shutdown and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, our manufacturing process could be disrupted, resulting in late deliveries or even no deliveries if there is a total shutdown. This could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and we could face financial losses.\nThe General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) went into effect in the EU on May 25, 2018. The GDPR creates a range of compliance obligations applicable to the collection, use, retention, security, processing, and transfer of personally identifiable information of EU residents. Violations of the GDPR may result in significant fines and sanctions. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with the GDPR, or any other privacy, data protection, information security, or consumer protection-related privacy laws and regulations could result in financial losses and have an adverse effect on our reputation.\nFurther, we routinely experience cyber security threats and attempts to gain access to sensitive information, as do our customers, suppliers, and other third parties with which we work. We have established threat detection, monitoring, and mitigation processes and procedures and are continually exploring ways to improve these processes and procedures. However, we cannot provide assurance that these processes and procedures will be sufficient to prevent cyber security threats from materializing. If threats do materialize, we could experience significant financial or information losses and/or reputational harm. If we are unable to protect sensitive or confidential information from these threats, our customers or governmental authorities could question the adequacy of our threat mitigation and detection processes and procedures and, as a result, our present and future business could be negatively impacted.\nWe are subject to financial maintenance covenants in our credit agreement and any failure to comply with such covenants, or obtain waivers in the event of non-compliance, could result in acceleration of outstanding indebtedness. Any additional issues related to B737 MAX production could cause us to breach our financial maintenance covenants.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had total debt of $3,034.3 million, including $438.5 million of borrowings under our term loan facility, $800.0 million under our revolving credit facility, $1,589.3 million of bonds, and $206.5 million of finance lease and other obligations. In addition to our debt, as of December 31, 2019, we had $21.5 million of letters of guarantee outstanding.\nOn February 24, 2020, we entered into an amendment (the \u201c2020 Amendment\u201d) to our 2018 Credit Agreement (as defined under Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources, below). Prior to entering into the 2020 Amendment, the 2018 Credit Agreement required the Company to maintain as of the end of each fiscal quarter a total leverage ratio not exceeding 3.50:1.00, and an interest coverage ratio that is not less than 4.00:1.00, each based on a test period that is the most recent four quarters then ended. Given the production suspension and 2020 production rate for the B737 MAX, absent entering into 2020 Amendment, the Company was expected to breach the total leverage ratio beginning with the quarter ending March 31, 2020 continuing into 2021. The 2020 Amendment waived or modified the testing of the ratios set forth in the 2018 Credit Agreement until the commencement of the second fiscal quarter of 2021 (the \u201cReversion Date\u201d) and put the following financial ratios and tests in place for such time period:\n\u2022\nSenior Secured Leverage Ratio: Commencing with the first fiscal quarter of 2020, the ratio of senior secured debt to consolidated EBITDA over the last twelve months shall not, as of the end of the applicable fiscal quarter, be greater than:\n(i) 3.00:1.00, with respect to the first fiscal quarter of 2020; (ii) 4.25:1.00, with respect to the second fiscal quarter of 2020; (iii) 5.50:1.00, with respect to the third fiscal quarter of 2020; (iv) 5.00:1.00, with respect to the fourth fiscal quarter of 2020; and (v) 3.00:1.00, with respect to the first fiscal quarter of 2021.\n\u2022\nInterest Coverage Ratio: Commencing with the first fiscal quarter of 2020, the interest coverage ratio as of the end of the applicable fiscal quarter shall not be less than: (i) 4.00:1.00, with respect to the first fiscal quarter of 2020; (ii) 3.75:1.00, with respect to the second fiscal quarter of 2020; (iii) 2.50:1.00, with respect to the third fiscal quarter of 2020; (iv) 2.25:1.00, with respect to the fourth fiscal quarter of 2020; and (v) 3.75:1.00, with respect to the first fiscal quarter of 2021.\n\u2022\nMinimum Liquidity: As of the end of each fiscal month, commencing with the first fiscal month ending after entering into the 2020 Amendment, the Company shall have minimum liquidity of not less than: (i) $1,000 million through, and including, the last fiscal month ending in the third fiscal quarter of 2020; (ii) $850 million, as of the end of each fiscal month ending in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2020; and (iii) $750 million, as of the end of each fiscal month ending in the first fiscal quarter of 2021; provided, however, that if the Company receives proceeds of at least $750 million from the issuance of indebtedness before the Reversion Date, the minimum liquidity requirement shall remain at $1,000 million. Liquidity includes cash and cash equivalents and amounts available to be drawn under the Revolver and the 2020 DDTL (as defined below).\nUpon the Reversion Date, the ratios will revert back to the ratios in the 2018 Credit Agreement except that the total leverage ratio will be 4.00:1.00, with respect to the second fiscal quarter of 2021, returning to 3.50:1:00 thereafter. The Senior Secured Leverage Ratio and minimum liquidity covenants will no longer be applicable following the Reversion Date. The Credit Agreement is further described under Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources, below.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with the financial and other covenants in the 2018 Credit Agreement as amended by the 2020 Amendment (the \"Credit Agreement\"). Among other things, any delays or adverse changes to the B737 MAX production schedule or other program, on which we rely to generate revenue, or difficulties in managing our cost structure to take into account changes in production schedules to accommodate a ramp-up in production, could significantly adversely affect our operating income and materially adversely affect our liquidity. The need to fund our pending acquisitions and associated expenses could also adversely affect our liquidity. Our failure to comply with these covenants could cause us to be unable to borrow under the agreement and may constitute an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of the maturity of any indebtedness then outstanding under the agreement, which would require us to pay all amounts outstanding. As of December 31, 2019, we had $1,239.7 million in indebtedness outstanding under the Credit Agreement. The occurrence of an event of default, or the acceleration of indebtedness under the Credit Agreement, could result in an event of default under other indebtedness we have outstanding as a result of cross-acceleration or cross default provisions, which would also entitle the creditors under those instruments to seek remedies, including requiring us to pay all amounts outstanding. There can be no assurance, in light of the B737 MAX grounding and resulting impacts on demand for the aircraft that, absent new debt or equity financing, the Company would have the funds to repay indebtedness that becomes due as a result of acceleration of the maturity in the future. Failure to maintain compliance with these covenants could (absent a further amendment or waiver) have a material adverse effect on our financial position, operations, and solvency, and could adversely affect the market price for our common stock and our ability to obtain financing in the future.\nThe 2020 DDTL is subject to substantially the same financial and other covenants as the Credit Agreement, except with respect to any covenants or events of default relating to security.\nA decline in the Company\u2019s financial performance or outlook, or the financial markets generally, could negatively impact the Company\u2019s access to the global capital markets, reduce the Company\u2019s liquidity and increase its borrowing costs.\nWe may periodically need to obtain additional financing in order to meet our debt obligations as they come due, to support our operations and/or to make acquisitions. Our access to the debt capital markets and the cost of borrowings are affected by a number of factors including market conditions and the strength of our credit ratings. A decline in the Company\u2019s financial performance or outlook due to internal or external factors, such as the B737 MAX grounding, could affect the Company\u2019s access to, and the availability or cost of financing on acceptable terms and conditions. There can be no assurance that the Company will have access to the global capital market on terms the Company finds acceptable. Limitations on the Company\u2019s ability to access the global capital markets, a reduction in the Company\u2019s liquidity or an increase in borrowing costs could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to maintain or grow its business, which in turn may adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.\nOur debt could adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to operate our business. The terms of our Credit Agreement impose significant operating and financial restrictions on our company and our subsidiaries, which could also adversely affect our operating flexibility and put us at a competitive disadvantage by preventing us from capitalizing on business opportunities.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had total debt of $3,034.3 million, including $1,238.5 million of borrowings under our Credit Agreement, $1,589.3 million of long-term bonds, $147.1 million of finance lease obligations, and approximately $59.4 million in other debt obligations. In addition to our debt, as of December 31, 2019, we had $21.5 million of letters of credit and letters of guarantee outstanding.\nThe terms of our Credit Agreement impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us, which limit our ability, among other things, to:\n\u2022\nincur additional debt or issue preferred stock with certain terms;\n\u2022\npay dividends or make distributions to our stockholders over certain amounts;\n\u2022\nrepurchase or redeem our capital stock;\n\u2022\nmake investments;\n\u2022\nincur liens;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with our stockholders and affiliates;\n\u2022\nsell certain assets;\n\u2022\nacquire the assets of, or merge or consolidate with, other companies (the Asco Acquisition and the Bombardier Acquisition are permitted thereunder);\n\u2022\nincur restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions or transfer assets to us; and\n\u2022\nconsider strategic transactions.\nThese restrictions could have consequences, including the following:\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions or other general corporate requirements;\n\u2022\nrequiring a substantial portion of our cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of other purposes;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimiting our financial flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in the industry in which we compete;\n\u2022\nplacing us at a disadvantage compared to other, less leveraged competitors;\n\u2022\nhaving a material adverse effect on us if we fail to comply with the covenants in the Credit Agreement or in the indentures governing our long-term bonds or in the instruments governing our other debt; and\n\u2022\nincreasing our cost of borrowing.\nThe terms of our Credit Agreement became significantly more restrictive as a result of the 2020 Amendment. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain compliance with the covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness in the future or, if we fail to do so, that we will be able to obtain waivers from the lenders and/or amend the covenants.\nIn addition, despite the restrictions and limitations described above, subject to the limits contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness, we may be able to incur additional debt from time to time to finance working capital, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions, or for other purposes. The terms of any future indebtedness we may incur could include more restrictive covenants. If we incur additional debt, the risks related to our high level of debt could intensify.\nIn addition, if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt and meet our other commitments, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt, sell material assets or operations, or raise additional debt or equity capital. We cannot provide assurance that we could affect any of these actions on a timely basis, on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or that these actions would be sufficient to meet our capital requirements. In addition, the terms of our existing or future debt agreements may restrict us from effecting certain or any of these alternatives.\nAny reduction in our credit ratings could limit the Company\u2019s ability to obtain future financing, increase its borrowing costs, increase the pricing of its credit facilities, adversely affect the market price of its securities, or otherwise impair its business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our corporate credit ratings were BBB- by Standard & Poor\u2019s Global Ratings (\u201cS&P\u201d), and Baa3 by Moody\u2019s Investors Service, Inc. (\u201cMoody\u2019s\u201d). On January 13, 2020, Moody\u2019s downgraded the Company\u2019s credit rating from Baa3 to Ba2, and the Company continues to be under review for a possible downgrade. On January 31, 2020, S&P downgraded the Company\u2019s credit rating from BBB- to BB.\nThe ratings reflect the agencies\u2019 assessment of our ability to pay interest and principal on our debt securities and credit agreements. A rating is not a recommendation to purchase, sell, or hold securities. Each rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization. Each rating agency has its own methodology for assigning ratings and, accordingly, each rating should be considered independently of all other ratings. Lower ratings would typically result in higher interest costs of debt securities when they are sold, could make it more difficult to issue future debt securities, could require us to provide creditors with more restrictive covenants, which would limit our flexibility and ability to pay dividends and may require us to\npledge additional collateral under our credit facility. Any downgrade in our credit ratings could thus have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition.\nOur delayed draw term loan facility has a short maturity and as a result only potentially would provide liquidity for a brief period.\nThe 2020 DDTL is intended to function as a short-term liquidity facility, if needed. The 2020 DDTL is available to be drawn until August 15, 2020, and matures and shall be repaid in full (if drawn) on the earlier to occur of (a) September 15, 2020 and (b) the date that is 45 days after the date on which the Federal Aviation Administration re-certifies the B737 MAX program. The commitments and loans under the 2020 DDTL are subject to mandatory reduction or prepayment, as applicable, with 100% of the net cash proceeds from issuances of indebtedness and equity interests, subject to certain exceptions. As a result, if Spirit receives net cash proceeds from issuances of indebtedness or equity that exceed the amount of the 2020 DDTL, the commitments under that facility will be canceled and any amounts outstanding prepaid.\nWe may sell more equity and reduce your ownership in Spirit Holdings.\nOur business plan may require the investment of new capital, which we may raise by issuing additional equity (including equity interests that may have a preference over shares of our Common Stock). However, this capital may not be available at all, or when needed, or upon terms and conditions favorable to us. The issuance of additional equity in Spirit Holdings may result in significant dilution of shares of our Common Stock. We may issue additional equity in connection with or to finance acquisitions and to enhance our liquidity in connection to the B737 MAX grounding. Further, our subsidiaries could issue securities in the future to persons or entities (including our affiliates) other than us or another subsidiary. This could materially adversely affect your investment in us because it would dilute your indirect ownership interest in our subsidiaries.\nSpirit Holdings\u2019 certificate of incorporation and by-laws and our supply agreements with Boeing contain provisions that could discourage another company from acquiring us and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions of Spirit Holdings\u2019 certificate of incorporation and by-laws may discourage, delay, or prevent a merger or acquisition that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace or remove our current board of directors. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nadvance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings; and\n\u2022\nthe authority of the board of directors to issue, without stockholder approval, up to 10 million shares of preferred stock with such terms as the board of directors may determine.\nIn addition, our supply agreements with Boeing include provisions giving Boeing the ability to terminate the agreements in the event any of certain disqualified persons acquire a majority of Spirit\u2019s direct or indirect voting power or all or substantially all of Spirit\u2019s assets.
