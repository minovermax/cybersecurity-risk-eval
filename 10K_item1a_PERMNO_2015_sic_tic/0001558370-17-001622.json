RISK FACTORS\nCertain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, in addition to other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that adversely affect our business. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital\nWe have a limited operating history and have incurred significant losses since our inception.\nWe have incurred net losses each year since our inception, including net losses of $23.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and $33.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $157.0 million. We have a limited operating history on which to base an evaluation of our business and investors should consider the risks and difficulties frequently encountered by early-stage companies in new and rapidly evolving markets, particularly companies engaged in the development of medical devices. To date, we have not commercialized any products or generated any revenues from the sale of products, and we do not expect to generate any product revenues in the foreseeable future. We do not know whether or when we will generate revenue or become profitable. Moreover, we may allocate significant amounts of capital towards products and technologies for which market demand is lower than anticipated and, as a result, may not achieve expectations or may elect to abandon such efforts.\nWe have devoted most of our financial resources to research and development, including our clinical and preclinical development activities related to our Neuro-Spinal Scaffold implant. Overall, we expect our research and development expenses to be substantial and to increase for the foreseeable future as we continue the development and clinical investigation of our current and future products. Our lead product candidate, the Neuro-Spinal Scaffold implant, is currently being studied in a pivotal probable benefit study and, as a result, we expect that it could be several years, if ever, before we have a product candidate ready for commercialization. Even if we obtain regulatory approval to market our Neuro-Spinal Scaffold implant or other products, our future revenues will depend upon the size of any markets in which our products have received approval, our ability to achieve sufficient market acceptance, reimbursement from third-party payers, and other factors.\nWe anticipate that we will continue to incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future and may never achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing net losses for at least the next several years. We expect our expenses will increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities, as we:\n\u00b7\ncontinue our pivotal probable benefit study of our Neuro-Spinal Scaffold implant;\n\u00b7\ncontinue the research and development of our other product candidates;\n\u00b7\nhave our product candidates manufactured for clinical trials and for commercial sale;\n\u00b7\nestablish a sales, marketing, and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any products for which we may obtain marketing approval;\n\u00b7\nmaintain, protect, and expand our intellectual property portfolio; and\n\u00b7\ncontinue our research and development efforts for new product opportunities.\nTo become and remain profitable, we must succeed in developing and commercializing our product candidates with significant market potential. This will require us to be successful in a range of challenging activities, including completing preclinical testing and clinical trials of our product candidates, developing additional product candidates, obtaining regulatory approval for these product candidates, and manufacturing, marketing, and selling any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval. We are only in the initial stages of most of these activities. We may never succeed in these activities and, even if we do, may never generate revenues that are significant enough to achieve profitability.\nEven if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become and remain profitable could depress the value of our Company and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, maintain our research and development efforts, diversify our product offerings, or even continue our operations. A decline in the value of our Company could cause you to lose all or part of your investment.\nThere is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, which will affect our ability to obtain future financing and may require us to curtail our operations.\nOur financial statements as of December 31, 2016 were prepared under the assumption that we will continue as a going concern. At December 31, 2016, we had cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $33.0 million. Given our development plans, we estimate cash resources will be sufficient to fund our operations into the beginning of the second quarter of 2018. This estimate is based on assumptions that may prove to be wrong; expenses could prove to be significantly higher, leading to a more rapid consumption of our existing resources.\nOur ability to continue as a going concern depends on our ability to obtain additional equity or debt financing, attain further operating efficiencies, reduce expenditures, and, ultimately, to generate revenue. If we are unable to continue as a going concern, we may have to liquidate our assets and may receive less than the value at which those assets are carried on our audited financial statements, and it is likely that investors will lose all or part of their investment. If we seek additional financing to fund our business activities in the future and there remains substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, investors or other financing sources may be unwilling to provide additional funding to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Based on these factors, management determined that there is substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. Our independent registered public accounting firm has expressed substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern in its report dated March 10, 2017 included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nWe will need additional funding in the future. If we are unable to raise capital when needed, we could be forced to delay, reduce, or eliminate our product development programs or commercialization efforts.\nWe expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we conduct our pivotal probable benefit study of, and seek regulatory approval for, our Neuro-Spinal Scaffold implant. In addition, if we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to manufacturing, marketing, sales, and distribution. Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we could be forced to delay, reduce, or eliminate our research and development programs or any future commercialization efforts.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our consolidated cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balance was approximately $33.0. We believe our current cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities are adequate to fund our operations into the beginning of the second quarter of 2018. However, since it is only an estimate and based on a number of factors, we may consume our resources earlier than anticipated. Our independent registered public accounting firm has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern in its report on our financial statements. Our future funding requirements, both near- and long-term, will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u00b7\nthe scope, progress, results, and costs of preclinical development, laboratory testing, and clinical studies for our Neuro-Spinal Scaffold implant and any other product candidates that we may develop or acquire;\n\u00b7\nfuture clinical trial results of our Neuro-Spinal Scaffold implant;\n\u00b7\nthe timing of, and the costs involved in, obtaining regulatory approvals for the Neuro-Spinal Scaffold implant if our pivotal probable benefit study is successful, and the outcome of regulatory review of the Neuro-Spinal Scaffold implant;\n\u00b7\nthe cost and timing of future commercialization activities for our products, if any of our product candidates are approved for marketing, including product manufacturing, marketing, sales, and distribution costs;\n\u00b7\nthe revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval;\n\u00b7\nthe cost of having our product candidates manufactured for clinical trials in preparation for regulatory approval and in preparation for commercialization;\n\u00b7\nthe cost and delays in product development as a result of any changes in regulatory oversight applicable to our product candidates;\n\u00b7\nour ability to establish and maintain strategic collaborations, licensing, or other arrangements and the financial terms of such agreements;\n\u00b7\nthe cost and timing of establishing sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities;\n\u00b7\nthe costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending, and enforcing our intellectual property portfolio;\n\u00b7\nthe efforts and activities of competitors and potential competitors;\n\u00b7\nthe effect of competing technological and market developments; and\n\u00b7\nthe extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses, products, and technologies.\nIdentifying potential product candidates and conducting preclinical testing and clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive, and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain regulatory approval and achieve product sales. In addition, our product\ncandidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. Our commercial revenues, if any, will be derived from sales of products that we do not expect to be commercially available for several years, if at all. Accordingly, we will need to continue to rely on additional financing to achieve our business objectives. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all, and if we are not successful in raising additional capital, we may not be able to continue as a going concern.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations, or require us to relinquish rights to our product candidates on unfavorable terms to us.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, and other third-party funding alternatives including license and collaboration agreements. To raise additional capital or pursue strategic transactions, we may in the future sell additional shares of our common stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock which will dilute the ownership interest of our current stockholders, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our current stockholders. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances, or marketing, distribution, or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our product candidates, future revenue streams or research programs, or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us or that may reduce the value of our common stock. If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce, or terminate our product development or commercialization efforts for our Neuro-Spinal Scaffold implant or any other product candidates that we develop or acquire.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards may be limited.\nWe have generated significant net operating loss carryforwards (\u201cNOLs\u201d) and research and development tax credits (\u201cR&D credits\u201d) as a result of our incurrence of losses and our conduct of research activities since inception. We generally are able to carry NOLs and R&D credits forward to reduce our tax liability in future years. However, our ability to utilize the NOLs and R&D credits is subject to the rules of Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (\u201cthe Code\u201d), as amended, respectively. Those sections generally restrict the use of NOLs and R&D credits after an \u201cownership change.\u201d An ownership change occurs if, among other things, the stockholders (or specified groups of stockholders) who own or have owned, directly or indirectly, 5% or more of a corporation\u2019s common stock or are otherwise treated as 5% stockholders under Section 382 of the Code and the United States Treasury Department regulations promulgated thereunder increase their aggregate percentage ownership of that corporation\u2019s stock by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage of the stock owned by these stockholders over the applicable testing period. In the event of an ownership change, Section 382 imposes an annual limitation on the amount of taxable income a corporation may offset with NOL carryforwards and Section 383 imposes an annual limitation on the amount of tax a corporation may offset with business credit (including the R&D credit) carryforwards. Any unused annual limitation may be carried over to later years until the applicable expiration date for the respective NOL or R&D credit carryforwards. We have completed several financings since our inception, which may have resulted in a change in control as defined by Sections 382 and 383 of the Code, or could result in a change in control in the future, but we have not completed an analysis of whether a limitation as noted above exists. We have not performed a Section 382 study yet but we will complete an appropriate analysis before our tax attributes are utilized.\nAcquisitions of companies, businesses, or technologies may substantially dilute our stockholders and increase our operating losses.\nWe may make acquisitions of businesses, technologies, or intellectual property rights that we believe would be necessary, useful, or complementary to our current business. Any such acquisition may require assimilation of the operations, products or product candidates, and personnel of the acquired business and the training and integration of its employees, and could substantially increase our operating costs, without any offsetting increase in revenue. Acquisitions may not provide the intended technological, scientific, or business benefits and could disrupt our operations and divert our limited resources and management\u2019s attention from our current operations, which could harm our existing product development efforts. While we may use cash or equity to finance a future acquisition, it is likely we would issue equity securities as a portion or all of the consideration in any acquisition. The issuance of equity securities for an acquisition could be substantially dilutive to our stockholders. Any investment made in, or funds advanced to, a potential acquisition target could also significantly, adversely affect our results of operations and could further reduce our limited capital resources. Any acquisition or action taken in anticipation of a potential acquisition or other change in business activities could substantially depress the price of our stock. In addition, our results of operations may suffer because of acquisition related costs, or the post-acquisition costs of funding the development of an acquired technology or product candidates or operations of the acquired business, or due to amortization or impairment costs for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets.\nRisks Related to the Development, Regulatory Approval, and Commercialization of Our Product Candidates\nWe depend heavily on the success of one product candidate, the Neuro-Spinal ScaffoldTM implant, which is currently being studied in a pivotal probable benefit study. Even if we obtain favorable clinical results, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for, or successfully commercialize, our Neuro-Spinal Scaffold implant.\nWe currently have only one product candidate, the Neuro-Spinal Scaffold implant, in clinical development, and our business depends almost entirely on the successful clinical development, regulatory approval, and commercialization of that product candidate, which may never occur. We currently have no products available for sale, generate no revenues from sales of any products, and we may never be able to develop marketable products. Our Neuro-Spinal Scaffold implant, which is currently being studied in an ongoing pivotal probable benefit study, will require substantial additional clinical development, testing, manufacturing process development, and regulatory approval before we are permitted to commence its commercialization. Before obtaining regulatory approval via the HDE pathway for the commercial sale of any product candidate, we must demonstrate through extensive preclinical testing and clinical trials that the product candidate does not pose an unreasonable or significant risk of illness or injury, and that the probable benefit to health outweighs the risk of injury or illness from its use, taking into account the probable risks and benefits of currently available devices or alternative forms of treatment. Alternatively, if we were to seek PMA approval for our product candidates, that would require demonstration that the product is safe and effective for use in each target indication. This process can take many years. Of the large number of medical devices in development in the United States, only a small percentage successfully complete the FDA regulatory approval process and are commercialized. Accordingly, even if we are able to obtain the requisite capital to continue to fund our development and clinical programs, we may be unable to successfully develop or commercialize our Neuro-Spinal Scaffold implant or any other product candidate.\nOur other product candidate, Therapeutic Trails\u2122, is in preclinical development. The clinical trials of our product candidates are, and the manufacturing and marketing of our product candidates will be, subject to extensive and rigorous review and regulation by numerous government authorities in the United States and in other countries where we intend to test and, if approved, market any product candidates.\nWe may experience delays in our ongoing pivotal probable benefit study for our Neuro-Spinal Scaffold implant, and we do not know whether modifications to The INSPIRE Study will be necessary, including whether, future clinical trials will need to be conducted and/or whether The INSPIRE Study will need to be redesigned. Further, we do not know whether The INSPIRE Study and patient enrollment will be completed on schedule, if at all. Clinical studies for other future product candidates, including those above, may experience delays or may not begin.\nBefore we can obtain regulatory approval for the sale of our Neuro-Spinal Scaffold implant, we must complete the pivotal probable benefit study. Our Neuro-Spinal Scaffold implant is currently being studied in a 20-subject pivotal study under our approved IDE application for the treatment of complete thoracic traumatic acute spinal cord injury. Even\nthough the initial results of our clinical studies in humans are promising, our results may subsequently fail to meet the safety and probable benefit standards required to obtain regulatory approvals. Our pivotal probable benefit study may not be successfully completed or may take longer than anticipated because of any number of factors, including potential delays in the enrollment of subjects in the study, the availability of scaffolds to supply to our clinical sites, failure to demonstrate safety and probable benefit of our Neuro-Spinal Scaffold implant, lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial, or unforeseen safety issues. In addition, we are currently in active discussions with the FDA regarding the set of clinical data that would support a future approval of the product. Modifications to our ongoing study due to those discussions may further delay completion of the study.\nIn addition, clinical trials can be delayed or aborted for a variety of reasons, including delay or failure to:\n\u00b7\nobtain regulatory approval to commence future clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nreach agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations (\u201cCROs\u201d) and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;\n\u00b7\nobtain IRB approval at each site;\n\u00b7\nrecruit, enroll, and retain patients through the completion of clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nmaintain clinical sites in compliance with trial protocols through the completion of clinical trials;\n\u00b7\naddress any patient safety concerns that arise during the course of the trial;\n\u00b7\ninitiate or add a sufficient number of clinical trial sites; or\n\u00b7\nmanufacture sufficient quantities of our product candidate for use in clinical trials.\nWe could encounter delays if a clinical trial is suspended or terminated by us, by the relevant IRBs at the sites at which such trials are being conducted, by the Data Safety Monitoring Board for such trial, or by the FDA or other regulatory authorities. Such authorities may impose such a suspension or termination due to a number of factors, including failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols, inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial site by the FDA or other regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold, unforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects, or changes in laws or regulations. Any delays in completing our clinical trials will increase our costs, slow down our product candidate development and approval process, and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenues. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition, and prospects significantly.\nWe may find it difficult to enroll patients in our clinical studies, which could delay or prevent clinical studies of our product candidates.\nIdentifying and qualifying patients to participate in clinical studies of our product candidates is critical to our success. The timing of our clinical studies depends on the speed at which we can enroll patients to participate in testing our product candidates. If we have difficulty enrolling a sufficient number of patients to conduct our clinical studies as planned, we may need to delay, limit, or terminate ongoing or planned clinical studies, any of which would have an adverse effect on our business.\nPatient enrollment is affected by a number of factors including:\n\u00b7\nseverity of the disease, injury, or condition under investigation;\n\u00b7\ndesign of the study protocol;\n\u00b7\nsize and nature of the patient population;\n\u00b7\neligibility criteria for and design of the study in question;\n\u00b7\nperceived risks and benefits of the product candidate under study;\n\u00b7\nproximity and availability of clinical study sites for prospective patients;\n\u00b7\navailability of competing therapies and clinical studies;\n\u00b7\nefforts to facilitate timely enrollment in clinical studies;\n\u00b7\npatient referral practices of physicians; and\n\u00b7\nability to monitor patients adequately during and after treatment.\nFor a period in 2016, as a result of an FDA pre-specified enrollment hold, we were unable to enroll patients in The INSPIRE Study pending FDA authorization to proceed with additional enrollment, which delayed our ability to open new sites and enroll patients at the pace we had anticipated. We may not be able to initiate or continue clinical studies if we cannot enroll a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in the clinical studies required by regulatory agencies. If we have difficulty enrolling a sufficient number of patients to conduct our clinical studies as planned, we may need to delay, limit, or terminate ongoing or planned clinical studies, any of which would have an adverse effect on our business.\nClinical trials involve a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome, and results of earlier studies and trials may not be predictive of future trial results.\nThe results of preclinical studies and early clinical trials of new medical devices do not necessarily predict the results of later-stage clinical trials. The design of our clinical trials is based on many assumptions about the expected effects of our product candidates, and if those assumptions are incorrect, the trials may not sufficiently produce results to support regulatory applications. We are currently pursuing marketing approval via our HDE which requires us to show the device does not pose an unreasonable or significant risk of illness or injury, and that the probable benefit of health outweighs the risk of injury or illness from its use. Preliminary results may not be confirmed upon full analysis of the detailed results of an early clinical trial. Product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show safety and probable benefit sufficient to support intended use claims despite having progressed through initial clinical testing. The data collected from clinical trials of our product candidates may not be sufficient to obtain regulatory approval in the United States or elsewhere. It is also possible that patients enrolled in clinical trials will experience adverse side effects that are not currently part of the product candidate\u2019s profile. Because of the uncertainties associated with clinical development and regulatory approval, we cannot determine if or when we will have an approved product for commercialization or achieve sales or profits.\nWe must obtain FDA approval before we can sell any of our products in the United States and approval of similar regulatory authorities in countries outside the United States before we can sell our products in such countries. We may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of our products if such approval is denied or delayed.\nThe development, manufacture, and marketing of our products are subject to government regulation in the United States and other countries. In the United States and most foreign countries, we must complete rigorous preclinical testing and extensive human clinical trials that demonstrate the safety and efficacy of a product in order to apply for regulatory approval to market the product. If the FDA grants regulatory approval of a product, the approval may be limited to specific indications or limited with respect to its distribution. Expanded or additional indications for approved devices may not be approved, which could limit our potential revenues. Foreign regulatory authorities may apply similar limitations or may refuse to grant any approval. Consequently, even if we believe that preclinical and clinical data are sufficient to support regulatory approval for our products, the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities may not ultimately grant approval for commercial sale in any jurisdiction. If our products are not approved, our ability to generate revenues will be limited and our business will be adversely affected.\nWe are currently pursuing an HDE regulatory pathway in the United States for our Neuro-Spinal Scaffold. The HDE requires that there must be no other comparable device available to provide therapy for this condition and requires sufficient information for the FDA to determine that the device does not pose an unreasonable or significant risk of\nillness or injury, and that the probable benefit to health outweighs the risk of injury or illness from its use. The amended protocol for The INSPIRE Study, which was approved in February 2016, established an Objective Performance Criterion (\u201cOPC\u201d), which is a measure of study success used in clinical studies designed to demonstrate safety and probable benefit in support of an HDE approval. The OPC for The INSPIRE Study is currently defined as 25% or more of the patients in the study demonstrating an improvement of at least one AIS grade by six months post-implantation. We are currently in discussions with the FDA regarding its request for changes to our pivotal probable benefit trial. We believe that the current study design is sufficient to demonstrate safety and probable benefit in support of an HDE application for marketing approval and we plan to provide to the FDA data from patient registries (the Cohort Study) that we believe will provide sufficient information for the FDA to determine that the device does not pose an unreasonable or significant risk of illness or injury, and that the probable benefit to health outweighs the risk of injury or illness from its use. However, we cannot be certain whether the FDA will approve our HDE without additional information or studies. For example, the FDA has recommended that we include a randomized, concurrent control arm in the study as part of a study design consideration. In addition, although the study is currently structured with the OPC as the primary component for demonstrating probable benefit, the OPC is not the only variable that the FDA would evaluate when reviewing a future HDE application and there can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the OPC as sufficient for demonstrating probable benefit. Moreover, analysis of data from the patient registries may suggest amendments to the protocol for The INSPIRE Study, including adjustment to the existing OPC, which might create a higher threshold for evidencing probable benefit. In the event our assessment that the current study design, or any amended study design we propose based upon patient registries, is not acceptable to the FDA, the ability to obtain approval under the HDE pathway may be delayed or may not be feasible. If the FDA does not approve or clear our products in a timely fashion, or at all, our business and financial condition will be adversely affected.\nThe 21st Century Cures Act recently increased the upper population limit for an HDE from 4,000 to 8,000, which allows us to potentially request an expansion of our current HUD to include additional patient populations beyond our current HUD for complete SCI. If we choose to pursue such an expansion, this may cause our application to be delayed or cause the FDA to request additional information. In addition, our current study is not designed to support approval beyond complete SCI. Thus, expansion would require additional studies. We cannot be certain that we will be able to increase the potential population that we might be able to treat based on the HDE pathway. If any of these events occur, our business and financial condition will be adversely affected.\nThere are risks associated with pursuing FDA approval via an HDE pathway, including the possibility that the approval could be withdrawn in the future if the FDA subsequently approves another device for the same intended use, as well as limitations on the ability to profit from sales of the product.\nIf the FDA subsequently approves a PMA or clears a 510(k) for the HUD or another comparable device with the same indication, the FDA may withdraw the HDE. Once a comparable device becomes legally marketed through PMA approval or 510(k) clearance to treat or diagnose the disease or condition in question, there may no longer be a need for the HUD and so the HUD may no longer meet the requirements of section 520(m)(2)(B) of the FDCA.\nExcept in certain circumstances, products approved under an HDE cannot be sold for an amount that exceeds the costs of research and development, fabrication, and distribution of the device (i.e., for profit). Currently, under section 520(m)(6)(A)(i) of the FDCA, as amended by the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, an HUD is only eligible to be sold for profit after receiving HDE approval if the device (1) is intended for the treatment or diagnosis of a disease or condition that occurs in pediatric patients or in a pediatric subpopulation, and such device is labeled for use in pediatric patients or in a pediatric subpopulation in which the disease or condition occurs; or (2) is intended for the treatment or diagnosis of a disease or condition that does not occur in pediatric patients or that occurs in pediatric patients in such numbers that the development of the device for such patients is impossible, highly impracticable, or unsafe. If an HDE-approved device does not meet either of the eligibility criteria, the device cannot be sold for profit. The legislation related to HUD/HDE profit eligibility expires on October 1, 2017 and may or may not be renewed.\nSome of our future products will be viewed by the FDA as combination products comprised of a biologic and medical device component, and the review of combination products is often more complex and more time consuming than the review of other types of products.\nIt is possible that some of our products, including our Therapeutic Trails injection, may be regulated by the FDA as combination products. As explained above in the Government Regulation section, for a combination product, the\nFDA must determine which center or centers within the FDA will review the product candidate and under what legal authority the product candidate will be reviewed. We are currently developing our regulatory strategies with respect to which regulatory pathway will be necessary to obtain clearance or approval, if medical device clearance or approval is required at all. We believe that the biologic component of the Therapeutic Trails injection will be reviewed by the CBER, although it is possible that it will be regulated by the FDA\u2019s CDER. The delivery tools associated with that product may be reviewed by the CDRH, either separately as a medical device, or in consultation with CBER or CDER as part of the BLA or NDA. The process of obtaining FDA marketing clearance or approval is lengthy, expensive, and uncertain, and we cannot be sure that our biologic device combination products, or any other products, will be cleared or approved in a timely fashion, or at all. In addition, the review of combination products is often more complex and more time consuming than the review of a product candidate under the jurisdiction of only one center within the FDA. We cannot be sure that the FDA will not select to have our combination products reviewed and regulated by only one FDA center and/or different legal authority, in which case the path to regulatory approval would be different and could be more lengthy and costly. If the FDA does not approve or clear our products in a timely fashion, or at all, our business and financial condition will be adversely affected.\nWe may face substantial competition, which may result in others discovering, developing, or commercializing products before or more successfully than we do.\nIn general, the biotechnology industry is subject to intense competition and rapid and significant technological change. We have many potential competitors, including major drug companies, specialized biotechnology firms, academic institutions, government agencies, and private and public research institutions. Many of these competitors have significantly greater financial and technical resources than us, and superior experience and expertise in research and development, preclinical testing, design and implementation of clinical trials, regulatory processes and approval for products, production and manufacturing, and sales and marketing of approved products. Large and established companies compete in the biotechnology market. In particular, these companies have greater experience and expertise in securing government contracts and grants to support their research and development efforts, conducting testing and clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals to market products, manufacturing such products on a broad scale, and marketing approved products. Smaller or early-stage companies and research institutions may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly if they have collaborative arrangements with larger and more established biotechnology companies. We will also face competition from these parties in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites, and registering subjects for clinical trials.\nIn order to effectively compete, we will have to make substantial investments in development, clinical testing, manufacturing, and sales and marketing, or partner with one or more established companies. There is no assurance that we will be successful in having our products approved or gaining significant market share for any of our products. Our technologies and products also may be rendered obsolete or noncompetitive as a result of products introduced by our competitors.\nThe results of our clinical trials may not support our product candidate claims or may result in the discovery of adverse side effects.\nOur ongoing research and development, preclinical testing, and clinical trial activities are subject to extensive regulation and review by numerous governmental authorities both in the United States and abroad. We are currently conducting a pivotal study of our Neuro-Spinal Scaffold implant to gather information about the product\u2019s safety and probable benefit. In the future, we may conduct clinical trials to support approval of new products. Clinical studies must be conducted in compliance with FDA regulations or the FDA may take enforcement action. The data collected from these clinical studies may ultimately be used to support market clearance for these products. Even if our clinical trials are completed as planned, we cannot be certain that their results will support our product candidate claims or that the FDA will agree with our conclusions regarding them. Success in preclinical studies and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful, and we cannot be sure that the later trials will replicate the results of prior trials and preclinical studies. The clinical trial process may fail to demonstrate that our product candidates are safe and effective for the proposed indicated uses, which could cause us to abandon a product candidate and may delay development of others. Any delay or termination of our clinical trials will delay the filing of our product submissions and, ultimately, our ability to commercialize our product candidates and generate revenues. It is also possible that patients enrolled in clinical trials will experience adverse side effects that are not currently part of the product candidate\u2019s profile.\nIf approved, our products will require market acceptance to be successful. Failure to gain market acceptance would impact our revenues and may materially impair our ability to continue our business.\nEven if we receive regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of our products, the commercial success of our products will depend on, among other things, their acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payers such as health insurance companies, and other members of the medical community as a therapeutic and cost-effective alternative to competing products and treatments. Physicians and hospitals will need to establish training and procedures to utilize and implement our Neuro-Spinal Scaffold implant, and there can be no assurance that these parties will adopt the use of our device or develop sufficient training and procedures to properly utilize it. Market acceptance of, and demand for, any product that we may develop and commercialize will depend on many factors, both within and outside of our control. Payers may view new products or products that have only recently been launched or with limited clinical data available, as investigational, unproven, or experimental, and on that basis may deny coverage of procedures involving use of our products. If our product candidates fail to gain market acceptance, we may be unable to earn sufficient revenue to continue our business.\nIf we or our suppliers fail to comply with ongoing FDA regulatory requirements, or if we experience unanticipated problems with our products, these products could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market.\nAny product for which we obtain regulatory clearance or approval, and the manufacturing processes, reporting requirements, post-approval clinical data, and promotional activities for such product, will be subject to continued regulatory review, oversight, and periodic inspections by the FDA. In particular, we and our third-party suppliers will be required to comply with the FDA\u2019s QSRs. These FDA regulations cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, control, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, sterilization, storage, and shipping of products. Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is monitored rigorously through periodic inspections by the FDA. If we, or our manufacturers, fail to adhere to QSR requirements, this could delay production of our product candidates and lead to fines, difficulties in obtaining regulatory clearances, recalls, enforcement actions, including injunctive relief or consent decrees, or other consequences, which could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, we and our suppliers are required to comply with Good Manufacturing Practices (\u201cGMPs\u201d) and Good Tissue Practices (\u201cGTPs\u201d) with respect to any human cells and biologic products we may develop, and International Standards Organization (\u201cISO\u201d) regulations for the manufacture of our products and other regulations which cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, control, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, storage, and shipping of any product for which we obtain clearance or approval. Manufacturing may also be subject to controls by the FDA for parts of the combination products that the FDA may find are controlled by the biologics regulations.\nThe FDA audits compliance with the QSR and other similar regulatory requirements through periodic announced and unannounced inspections of manufacturing and other facilities. The failure by us or one of our suppliers to comply with applicable statutes and regulations administered by the FDA, or the failure to timely and adequately respond to any adverse inspectional observations or product safety issues, could result in any of the following enforcement actions:\n\u00b7\nuntitled letters, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees, and civil penalties;\n\u00b7\nunanticipated expenditures to address or defend such actions;\n\u00b7\ncustomer notifications or repair, replacement, refunds, recall, detention, or seizure of our products;\n\u00b7\noperating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;\n\u00b7\nrefusing or delaying our requests for premarket approval of new products or modified products;\n\u00b7\nwithdrawing PMA approvals that have already been granted;\n\u00b7\nrefusal to grant export approval for our products; or\n\u00b7\ncriminal prosecution.\nAny of these sanctions could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur products and operations are subject to extensive governmental regulation both in the United States and abroad, and our failure to comply with applicable requirements could cause our business to suffer.\nOur medical device and biologic products and operations are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and various other federal, state, and foreign governmental authorities. For example, we expect to initiate a clinical trial in Canada and will be subject to applicable Canadian regulations as we initiate and conduct that trial. Government regulation of medical devices and biologic products is meant to assure their safety and effectiveness, and includes regulation of, among other things:\n\u00b7\ndesign, development, and manufacturing;\n\u00b7\ntesting, labeling, content, and language of instructions for use and storage;\n\u00b7\nclinical trials;\n\u00b7\nproduct safety;\n\u00b7\nmarketing, sales, and distribution;\n\u00b7\nregulatory clearances and approvals including premarket clearance and approval;\n\u00b7\nconformity assessment procedures;\n\u00b7\nproduct traceability and record keeping procedures;\n\u00b7\nadvertising and promotion;\n\u00b7\nproduct complaints, complaint reporting, recalls, and field safety corrective actions;\n\u00b7\npost-market surveillance, including reporting of deaths or serious injuries, and malfunctions that, if they were to recur, could lead to death or serious injury;\n\u00b7\npost-market studies; and\n\u00b7\nproduct import and export.\nThe regulations to which we are subject are complex and have tended to become more stringent over time. Regulatory changes could result in restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations higher than anticipated costs or lower than anticipated sales.\nBefore we can market or sell a new regulated medical device product in the United States, we must obtain clearance under Section 510(k) of the FDCA, approval of a PMA, or approval of an HDE, unless the device is specifically exempt from premarket review. Our Neuro-Spinal Scaffold implant is expected to be regulated by the FDA as a Class III medical device, requiring either PMA or HDE approval. An HUD designation was granted for the Neuro-Spinal Scaffold implant in 2013, opening the HDE pathway.\nIn the PMA approval process, the FDA must determine that a proposed device is safe and effective for its intended use based, in part, on extensive data, including, but not limited to, technical, preclinical, clinical trial, manufacturing, and labeling data. Modifications to products that are approved through a PMA generally need FDA approval. The process of obtaining a PMA is costly and generally takes from one to three years, or even longer, from the time the application is submitted to the FDA until an approval is obtained.\nAn HDE application is similar in form and content to a PMA and, although exempt from the effectiveness requirements of a PMA, an HDE does require sufficient information for the FDA to determine that the device does not pose an unreasonable or significant risk of illness or injury, and that the probable benefit to health outweighs the risk of injury or illness from its use. Like a PMA, changes to HDE devices generally need FDA approval.\nBiological products must satisfy the requirements of the Public Health Services Act and its implementing regulations. In order for a biologic product to be legally marketed in the U.S., the product must have a BLA approved by the FDA. The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort, and financial resources, and each may take several years to complete.\nThe FDA can delay, limit, or deny clearance or approval of a product for many reasons, including:\n\u00b7\nwe may not be able to demonstrate to the FDA\u2019s satisfaction that our products are safe and effective for their intended uses;\n\u00b7\nthe data from our preclinical studies and clinical trials may be insufficient to support clearance or approval, where required; and\n\u00b7\nthe manufacturing process or facilities we use may not meet applicable requirements.\nIn addition, the FDA may change its clearance and approval policies, adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations, or take other actions that may prevent or delay approval or clearance of our products under development or impact our ability to modify our currently approved or cleared products on a timely basis.\nIn addition, even after we have obtained the proper regulatory clearance or approval to market a product, the FDA has the power to require us to conduct post-marketing studies. Failure to conduct required studies in a timely manner could result in the revocation of approval for the product that is subject to such a requirement and could also result in the recall or withdrawal of the product, which would prevent us from generating sales from that product in the United States.\nFailure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could jeopardize our ability to sell our products and result in enforcement actions such as:\n\u00b7\nwarning letters;\n\u00b7\nfines;\n\u00b7\ninjunctions;\n\u00b7\ncivil penalties;\n\u00b7\ntermination of distribution;\n\u00b7\nrecalls or seizures of products;\n\u00b7\ndelays in the introduction of products into the market;\n\u00b7\ntotal or partial suspension of production;\n\u00b7\nrefusal of the FDA or other regulators to grant future clearances or approvals;\n\u00b7\nwithdrawals or suspensions of current clearances or approvals, resulting in prohibitions on sales of our products; and/or\n\u00b7\nin the most serious cases, criminal penalties.\nAny of these sanctions could result in higher than anticipated costs or lower than anticipated sales and have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nIf our medical device products, or malfunction of our medical device products, cause or contribute to a death or a serious injury before or after approval, we will be subject to medical device reporting regulations, which can result in voluntary corrective actions or agency enforcement actions.\nUnder the FDA medical device reporting regulations, medical device manufacturers with approved products are required to report to the FDA information that a device has or may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or has malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction of the device or one of our similar devices were to recur. Any such serious adverse event involving our products could result in future voluntary corrective actions, such as recalls or customer notifications, or agency action, such as inspection or enforcement action. In the context of our ongoing clinical trial, we report adverse events to the FDA in accordance with IDE regulations and to other relevant regulatory authorities in accordance with applicable national and local regulations. Any corrective action, whether voluntary or involuntary, and either pre- or post-market, needed to address any serious adverse events will require the dedication of our time and capital, distract management from operating our business, and may harm our reputation and financial results.\nOur medical device products, once approved, may in the future be subject to product recalls. A recall of our products, either voluntarily or at the direction of the FDA, or the discovery of serious safety issues with our products, could have a significant adverse impact on us.\nIf our products are approved for commercialization, the FDA and similar foreign governmental authorities have the authority to require the recall of commercialized products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture. In the case of the FDA, the authority to require a recall must be based on an FDA finding that there is reasonable probability that the device would cause serious injury or death. A government-mandated or voluntary recall by us or one of our partners could occur as a result of an unacceptable risk to health, component failures, malfunctions, manufacturing errors, design or labeling defects, or other deficiencies and issues. Recalls of any of our commercialized products would divert managerial and financial resources and have an adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations, and financial condition, which could impair our ability to produce our products in a cost-effective and timely manner in order to meet our customers\u2019 demands. We may also be subject to liability claims, be required to bear other costs, or take other actions that may have a negative impact on our future sales and our ability to generate profits.\nIf we obtain approval for our products, we may be subject to enforcement action if we engage in improper marketing or promotion of our products.\nWe are not permitted to promote or market our investigational products. After approval, our promotional materials and training methods must comply with FDA and other applicable laws and regulations, including the prohibition of the promotion of unapproved, or off-label, use. Surgeons may use our products off-label, as the FDA does not restrict or regulate a surgeon\u2019s choice of treatment within the practice of medicine. However, if the FDA determines that our promotional materials or training constitutes promotion of an off-label use, it could request that we modify our training or promotional materials or subject us to regulatory or enforcement actions, including the issuance of an untitled letter, a warning letter, injunction, seizure, civil fine, or criminal penalties. It is also possible that other federal, state, or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they consider our promotional or training materials to constitute promotion of an off-label use, which could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities, such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement. In that event, our reputation could be damaged and adoption of the products could be impaired. In addition, the off-label use of our products may increase the risk of product liability claims. Product liability claims are expensive to defend and could divert our management\u2019s attention, result in substantial damage awards against us, and harm our reputation.\nIf we obtain approval for our products, their commercial success will depend in part upon the level of reimbursement we receive from third parties for the cost of our products to users.\nThe commercial success of any product will depend, in part, on the extent to which reimbursement for the costs of our products and related treatments will be available from third-party payers such as government health administration authorities, private health insurers, managed care programs, and other organizations. Adequate third-party insurance coverage may not be available for us to establish and maintain price levels that are sufficient for us to continue our business or for realization of an appropriate return on investment in product development.\nLegislative or regulatory reform of the healthcare systems in which we operate may affect our ability to commercialize our product candidates and could adversely affect our business.\nThe government and regulatory authorities in the United States, the European Union, and other markets in which we plan to commercialize our product candidates may propose and adopt new legislation and regulatory requirements relating to the approval, CE marking, manufacturing, promotion, or reimbursement of medical device and biologic products. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted or applicable regulations, guidance, or interpretations changed and what the impact of such changes, if any, may be. Such legislation or regulatory requirements, or the failure to comply with such, could adversely impact our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFor example, on September 26, 2012, the European Commission adopted a package of legislative proposals designed to replace the existing regulatory framework for medical devices in the European Union. These proposals are intended to strengthen the medical devices rules in the European Union. On June 17, 2016, the Dutch Presidency of the Council of the European Union formally informed the Council of Ministers of the agreement that was reached on May 25, 2016 with the European Parliament as part of the discussion concerning the text of the proposed Medical Devices Regulation (\u201cMDR\u201d) and the In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices Regulation (\u201cIVDR\u201d). On February 22, 2017, after finalization of a final linguistic review of the texts and the last revisions, the final text of the MDR and IVDR were published on the Council of the European Union's website. The regulations are now anticipated to be definitively adopted by the Council and the European Parliament by the end of the March 2017. The regulations, which will substantially impact medical devices manufacturers, will be applicable from May 2020 for the MDR and May 2022 for the IVDR. When adopted and applicable, the proposed MDR may prevent or delay the CE marking of our products under development or impact our ability to modify our currently CE marked products on a timely basis.\nSimilarly, in the United States, legislative changes have been enacted in the past and further changes are proposed that would impact the Affordable Care Act. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding. Beginning April 1, 2013, Medicare payments for all items and services, including drugs and biologics, were reduced by 2% under the sequestration (i.e., automatic spending reductions) required by the Budget Control Act of 2011, as amended by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012. Subsequent legislation extended the 2% reduction, on average, to 2025. It is likely that federal and state legislatures within the United States and foreign governments will continue to consider changes to existing healthcare legislation. The Affordable Care Act has faced ongoing legal challenges, including litigation seeking to invalidate some of or all of the law or the manner in which it has been implemented, and Congressional leaders and the recently elected President have stated that they intend to repeal or modify some or all of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act, as well as make additional changes to portions of Medicare and Medicaid. We cannot predict the reform initiatives that may be adopted in the future or whether initiatives that have been adopted will be repealed or modified. Because of the continued uncertainty about the effects, implementation, and potential repeal or modification of the Affordable Care Act and other federal healthcare legislation, we cannot quantify or predict with any certainty the likely impact of the Affordable Care Act, its amendment or repeal, or any alternative or related legislation, or any implementation of any such legislation, on our business model, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn addition, in June 2016, eligible members of the electorate in the United Kingdom decided by referendum to exit the European Union, which is commonly referred to as Brexit. Since a significant proportion of the regulatory framework in the United Kingdom is derived from European Union directives and regulations, the referendum could materially impact the regulatory regime with respect to the approval of our product candidates in the United Kingdom or the European Union. We are currently planning to open sites for The INSPIRE Study and anticipate that we will be subject to applicable U.K. regulations. Because of the continued uncertainty about the effects, implementation, or potential repeal of Brexit, we cannot quantify or predict with any certainty the likely impact of Brexit or related legislation on our business model, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThese and other legislative and regulatory changes that have been or may be proposed in the future may impact our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates.\nWe have limited experience manufacturing our Neuro-Spinal ScaffoldTM implant for clinical-study scale and no experience for commercial scale.\nTo date, we have manufactured our Neuro-Spinal Scaffold implant on a small scale, including sufficient supply that is needed for our clinical studies. We may encounter unanticipated problems in the scale-up process that will result in delays in the manufacturing of the Neuro-Spinal Scaffold implant and therefore delay our clinical studies. During our clinical trials, we are subject to FDA regulations requiring manufacturing of our scaffolds with the FDA requirements for design controls and subject to inspections by regulatory agencies. Our failure to comply with applicable regulations may result in delays and interruptions to our product supply while we seek to secure another supplier that meets all regulatory requirements. If we are unable to scale up our manufacturing to meet requirements for our clinical studies, we may be required to rely on contract manufacturers. Reliance on third-party manufacturers entails risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured the product ourselves, including the possible breach of the manufacturing agreements by the third parties because of factors beyond our control, and the possibility of termination or nonrenewal of the agreements by the third parties because of our breach of the manufacturing agreement or based on their own business priorities.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nWe license certain technology underlying the development of our Neuro-Spinal Scaffold from BCH and MIT, and the loss of the license would result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, and operating results and cause the market value of our common stock to decline.\nWe license technology from BCH and MIT that is integrated into our Neuro-Spinal Scaffold implant under an exclusive license. Under the license agreement, we have agreed to milestone payments and to meet certain reporting obligations. In the event that we were to breach any of the obligations under the agreement and fail to timely cure, BCH and MIT would have the right to terminate the agreement upon notice. In addition, BCH and MIT have the right to terminate our license upon the bankruptcy or receivership of the Company. If we are unable to continue to use or license this technology on reasonable terms, or if this technology fails to operate properly, we may not be able to secure alternatives in a timely manner and our ability to develop our products could be harmed.\nIf we cannot protect, maintain and, if necessary, enforce our intellectual property rights, our ability to develop and commercialize products will be adversely impacted.\nOur success, in large part, depends on our ability to protect and maintain the proprietary nature of our technology. We and our licensors must prosecute and maintain our existing patents and obtain new patents. Some of our proprietary information may not be patentable, and there can be no assurance that others will not utilize similar or superior solutions to compete with us. We cannot guarantee that we will develop proprietary products that are patentable, and that, if issued, any patent will give a competitive advantage or that such patent will not be challenged by third parties. The process of obtaining patents can be time consuming with no certainty of success, as a patent may not issue or may not have sufficient scope or strength to protect the intellectual property it was intended to protect. We cannot assure you that our means of protecting our proprietary rights will suffice or that others will not independently develop competitive technology or design around patents or other intellectual property rights issued to us. Even if a patent is issued, it does not guarantee that it is valid or enforceable. Any patents that we or our licensors have obtained or obtain in the future may be challenged, invalidated, or unenforceable. If necessary, we may initiate actions to protect our intellectual property, which can be costly and time consuming.\nIf third parties successfully claim that we infringe their intellectual property rights, our ability to continue to develop and commercialize products could be delayed or prevented.\nThird parties may claim that we or our licensors are infringing on or misappropriating their proprietary information. Other organizations are engaged in research and product development efforts that may overlap with our products. Such third parties may currently have, or may obtain in the future, legally blocking proprietary rights, including patent rights, in one or more products or methods under development or consideration by us. These rights may prevent us from commercializing products, or may require us to obtain a license from the organizations to use the technology. We may not be able to obtain any such licenses that may be required on reasonable financial terms, if at all, and cannot be sure that the patents underlying any such licenses will be valid or enforceable. There may be rights that we are not aware of, including applications that have been filed but not published that, when issued, could be asserted against us. These third parties could bring claims against us that would cause us to incur substantial expenses and, if successful, could cause us to pay substantial damages. Further, if a patent infringement suit were brought against us, we could be forced to stop or delay research and development of the product that is the subject of the suit. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our trade secrets or other confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation.\nRisks Related to our Dependence on Third Parties\nWe will depend upon strategic relationships to develop, exploit, and manufacture our products. If these relationships are not successful, we may not be able to capitalize on the market potential of these products.\nThe near and long-term viability of our products will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully establish new strategic collaborations with biotechnology companies, hospitals, insurance companies, and government agencies. Establishing strategic collaborations is difficult and time-consuming. Potential collaborators may reject collaborations based upon their assessment of our financial, regulatory, or intellectual property position. If we fail to establish a sufficient number of collaborations on acceptable terms, we may not be able to commercialize our products or generate sufficient revenue to fund further research and development efforts.\nEven if we establish new collaborations, these relationships may never result in the successful development or commercialization of any of our product candidates for reasons both within and outside of our control.\nThere are a limited number of suppliers that can provide materials to us. Any problems encountered by such suppliers may detrimentally impact us.\nWe rely on third-party suppliers and vendors for certain of the materials used in the manufacture of our products or other of our product candidates. Any significant problem experienced by one of our suppliers could result in a delay or interruption in the supply of materials to us until such supplier resolves the problem or an alternative source of supply is located. Any delay or interruption could negatively affect our operations.\nIf the third parties on which we rely to conduct our laboratory testing, animal, and human clinical trials do not perform as contractually required or expected, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our products.\nWe have been, and will continue to be, dependent on third-party CROs, medical institutions, investigators, and contract laboratories to conduct certain of our laboratory testing, animal and human clinical studies. We are responsible for confirming that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with our approved plan and protocol. Moreover, the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies require us to comply with regulations and standards, commonly referred to as good clinical practices, for conducting, recording, and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the trial participants are adequately protected. Our reliance on these third parties does not relieve us of these responsibilities and requirements. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or regulatory obligations or meet expected deadlines, if the third parties need to be replaced, or if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our preclinical development activities or clinical trials may be extended,\ndelayed, suspended, or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval or successfully commercialize our products on a timely basis, if at all, and our business, operating results, and prospects may be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Employee Matters and Managing Growth\nOur success depends on our ability to retain our management and other key personnel.\nWe depend on our senior management as well as key scientific personnel. The loss of any of these individuals could harm our business and significantly delay or prevent the achievement of research, development, or business objectives. Competition for qualified employees is intense among biotechnology companies, and the loss of qualified employees, or an inability to attract, retain, and motivate additional highly skilled employees could hinder our ability to successfully develop marketable products.\nOur future success also depends on our ability to identify, attract, hire, train, retain, and motivate other highly skilled scientific, technical, marketing, managerial, and financial personnel. Although we will seek to hire and retain qualified personnel with experience and abilities commensurate with our needs, there is no assurance that we will succeed despite our collective efforts. The loss of the services of any of our senior management or other key personnel could hinder our ability to fulfill our business plan and further develop and commercialize our products and services. Competition for personnel is intense, and any failure to attract and retain the necessary technical, marketing, managerial, and financial personnel would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees, consultants, or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information of third parties.\nWe have received confidential and proprietary information from collaborators, prospective licensees, and other third parties. In addition, we employ individuals who were previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies. We may be subject to claims that we or our employees, consultants, or independent contractors have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed confidential information of these third parties or our employees\u2019 former employers. We may also be subject to claims that former employees, collaborators, or other third parties have an ownership interest in our patents or other intellectual property. We may be subject to ownership disputes in the future arising, for example, from conflicting obligations of consultants or others who are involved in developing our product candidates. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights, such as exclusive ownership of, or right to use, valuable intellectual property. Such an outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial cost and be a distraction to our management and employees.\nRisks Related to Litigation and Legal Compliance\nWe are subject to lawsuits, which could divert management\u2019s attention and harm our business.\nWe are the subject of a securities class action lawsuit. The lawsuit, filed in July 2014, alleges violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in connection with allegedly false and misleading statements related to the timing and completion of the clinical study of our Neuro-Spinal Scaffold implant. That lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice in April 2015. Plaintiffs filed an appeal of that dismissal to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. On January 9, 2017, the Court of Appeals issued an order and opinion affirming the dismissal of all claims with prejudice. The time for filing a petition for a writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court has not yet expired. If a petition for a writ of certiorari is filed, we cannot provide any assurance that we will be successful in defending against such an appeal or, if the dismissal is overturned, in defending the underlying lawsuit. Nor can we be certain that insurance proceeds will be sufficient to cover any liability under such claims. Additionally, we may face additional lawsuits, including class action or securities derivative lawsuits. We are also involved in litigation with our former Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and Chief Financial Officer. We were previously the subject of a securities derivative lawsuit, which was dismissed in January 2017, and the deadline for appealing that decision has passed. See \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d below for further information regarding our litigation.\nThe amount of time that will be required to resolve these lawsuits is unpredictable and these actions may divert management\u2019s attention from the day-to-day operations of our business, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and cash flows. Any litigation or claim against us, even those without merit, may cause us to incur substantial costs, and could place a significant strain on our financial resources, divert the attention of management from our core business and harm our reputation.\nWe face potential product liability claims, and, if successful claims are brought against us, we may incur substantial liability and costs.\nWe will have exposure to claims for product liability. Product liability coverage for the healthcare industry is expensive and sometimes difficult to obtain. We may not be able to maintain such insurance on acceptable terms or be able to secure increased coverage if the commercialization of our products progresses, nor can we be sure that existing or future claims against us will be covered by our product liability insurance. Moreover, the existing coverage of our insurance policy or any rights of indemnification and contribution that we may have may not be sufficient to offset existing or future claims. A successful claim may prevent us from obtaining adequate product liability insurance in the future on commercially desirable terms, if at all. Even if a claim is not successful, defending such a claim would be time-consuming and expensive, may damage our reputation in the marketplace, and would likely divert our management\u2019s attention.\nWe are subject to environmental, health, and safety laws. Failure to comply with such environmental, health, and safety laws could cause us to become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nWe are subject to various environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations, including those relating to safe working conditions, laboratory, and manufacturing practices, the experimental use of animals and humans, emissions and wastewater discharges, and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances used in connection with our research. Any of these laws or regulations could cause us to incur additional expense or restrict our operations. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations may be expensive, and current or future environmental regulations may impair our research and development efforts.\nOur relationships with customers and third party payers will be subject to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, program exclusion, contractual damages, reputational harm, and diminished profits and future earnings.\nHealthcare providers, physicians, and third party payers will play a primary role in the recommendation and use of our products and any other product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Our future arrangements with healthcare providers, physicians, and third party payers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell, and distribute any products for which we obtain marketing approval. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations include the following:\n\u00b7\nthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving, or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order, or recommendation or arranging of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid;\n\u00b7\nthe federal False Claims Act imposes criminal and civil penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false or fraudulent claims for payment by a federal healthcare program or making a false statement or record material to payment of a false claim or avoiding, decreasing, or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government, with potential liability including mandatory treble damages and significant per-claim penalties;\n\u00b7\nthe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\u201cHIPAA\u201d), imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;\n\u00b7\nHIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n\u00b7\nthe federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires applicable manufacturers of covered products to report payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals; and\n\u00b7\nanalogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws and transparency statutes, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third party payers, including private insurers.\nSome state laws require device companies to comply with the industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government and may require product manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nIf our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Any penalties, damages, fines, curtailment, or restructuring of our operations could adversely affect our financial results. If any such actions are instituted against us and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.\nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations, or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal, and administrative penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion of products from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil, or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs.\nRisks Related to Investment in Our Securities\nThe price of our common stock may become volatile, which could lead to losses by investors and costly securities litigation.\nThe trading price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could fluctuate in response to factors such as:\n\u00b7\nthe status, completion, and/or results of our clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nactual or anticipated variations in our operating results;\n\u00b7\nannouncements of developments by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7\nregulatory actions regarding our products;\n\u00b7\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments;\n\u00b7\nadoption of new accounting standards affecting our industry;\n\u00b7\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u00b7\nsales of our common stock or other securities in the open market; and\n\u00b7\nother events or factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nThe stock market is subject to significant price and volume fluctuations. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been initiated against such company. Litigation initiated against us, whether or not successful, could result in substantial costs and diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources, which could harm our business and financial condition.\nInvestors may experience dilution of their ownership interests because of the future issuance of additional shares of our common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2016, there were outstanding warrants to purchase 3,391,439 shares of our common stock, and outstanding options to purchase 3,193,785 shares of our common stock. We expect to issue additional equity awards to compensate employees, consultants, and directors, and may issue additional shares to raise capital, to acquire other companies or technologies, to pay for services, or for other corporate purposes. Any such issuances will have the effect of diluting the interest of current stockholders. The future issuance of any such additional shares of common stock may create downward pressure on the trading price of the common stock. There can be no assurance that we will not be required to issue additional shares, warrants, or other convertible securities in the future in conjunction with any capital raising efforts, including at a price (or exercise prices) below the price at which shares of our common stock are currently quoted on the Nasdaq Global Market.\nAnti-takeover effects of certain provisions of our articles of incorporation and Nevada state law may discourage or prevent a takeover.\nOur articles of incorporation divide our Board of Directors into three classes, with three-year staggered terms. The classified board provision could increase the likelihood that, in the event an outside party acquired a controlling block of our stock, incumbent directors nevertheless would retain their positions for a substantial period, which may have the effect of discouraging, delaying, or preventing a change in control. In addition, Nevada has a business combination law, which prohibits certain business combinations between Nevada corporations and \u201cinterested stockholders\u201d for three years after the interested stockholder first becomes an interested stockholder, unless the corporation\u2019s board of directors approves the combination in advance. In addition, we may become subject to Nevada\u2019s control share laws. A corporation is subject to Nevada\u2019s control share law if it has more than 200 stockholders, at least 100 of whom are stockholders of record and residents of Nevada, and if the corporation does business in Nevada, including through an affiliated corporation. This control share law may have the effect of discouraging corporate takeovers. Currently, we believe that we have less than 100 stockholders of record who are residents of Nevada, and are therefore not subject to the control share laws.\nThe provisions of our articles of incorporation and Nevada\u2019s business combination and control share laws make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us and make a takeover more difficult to complete, even if such a transaction were in our stockholders\u2019 interest or might result in a premium over the market price for our common stock.", "PERMNO": 15297, "SIC": 3841, "TIC": "NVIV"}
