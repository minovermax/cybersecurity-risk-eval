{"cik": "42682", "company": "GORMAN RUPP CO", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-02-23", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nGorman-Rupp\u2019s business and financial performance are subject to various risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond its control. In addition to the risks discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-K, the following risks and uncertainties could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and access to capital markets. These risks could cause the Company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from its historical experience and from expected results discussed in forward-looking statements made by the Company related to conditions or events that it anticipates may occur in the future.\nContinuation of current and projected future business environment\nThe overall pump industry is cyclical in nature, and some of its business activity is related to general business conditions in the durable goods and capital equipment markets. Demand for most of the Company\u2019s products and services is affected by the level of new capital investment and planned maintenance expenditures by its customers. The level of such investment and expenditures by our customers depends, in turn, on factors such as general economic conditions, availability of credit, economic conditions within their respective industries and expectations of future market behavior. Volatility in prices of commodities such as oil and agricultural products can negatively affect the levels of investment and expenditures of certain customers and result in postponement of capital spending decisions or the delay or cancellation of existing orders which may negatively impact the Company\u2019s sales.\nHighly competitive markets\nGorman-Rupp sells products in highly competitive markets. Maintaining and improving the Company\u2019s competitive position requires periodic investment in manufacturing, engineering, quality standards, marketing, customer service and support, and distribution networks. Even with such investment, the Company may not be successful in maintaining its competitive position. The Company\u2019s competitors may develop products that are superior to its products, or may develop methods of more efficiently and effectively providing products and services, or may adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements. Pricing pressures may require the Company to adjust the prices of its products downward to stay competitive. The Company may not be able to compete successfully with its existing competitors or with new competitors. Failure to compete successfully could reduce the Company\u2019s sales, operating margins and overall financial performance.\nAvailability of raw materials\nThe Company could be adversely affected by raw material price volatility and any inability of suppliers to meet quality and delivery requirements. Additionally, raw material and energy expenses are substantive drivers of costs in the manufacture of pumps and changes in these costs are often unpredictable. The Company may not be able to pass along any increased material costs to customers for competitive or other reasons. While the Company manufactures certain parts and components used in its products, the Company\u2019s business requires substantial amounts of raw materials, parts and components that are purchased from suppliers. The availability and prices of raw materials, parts and components may be subject to curtailment or change due to, among other things, suppliers\u2019 allocations to other purchasers, interruptions in production by suppliers, changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels. Any change in the availability of, or increases in the price for, these raw materials, parts and components could materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nLoss of key management\nThe Company\u2019s success depends to a significant extent on the continued service of its executive management team and the ability to recruit, hire and retain other key management personnel to support the Company\u2019s growth and operational initiatives and replace executives who retire or resign. Failure to retain key management and attract and retain other highly-skilled personnel could limit the Company\u2019s global growth and operational initiatives, or may result in inefficient and ineffective management and operations, which could harm the Company\u2019s revenues, operations and product development efforts and could eventually result in a decrease in profitability.\nCyber security threats\nIncreased global information technology security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of Gorman-Rupp\u2019s systems and networks and to the confidentiality, availability, and\nintegrity of its data. While the Company attempts to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures, including employee training, comprehensive monitoring of its networks and systems, and the deployment of backup and protective systems, the Company\u2019s systems, networks, proprietary information, products, solutions and services remain potentially vulnerable to advanced persistent threats. Depending on their nature and scope, such threats could potentially lead to damages or destruction including, but not limited to, the compromising of confidential information relating to customer, supplier, or employee data, improper use of the Company\u2019s systems and networks, manipulation and destruction of data, defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions which, in turn, could adversely affect Gorman-Rupp\u2019s reputation, competitiveness, and results of operations.\nAcquisition performance and integration\nThe Company\u2019s historical growth has depended, and its future growth is likely to continue to depend, in part on its acquisition strategy and the successful integration of acquired businesses into existing operations. The Company intends to continue to seek additional acquisition opportunities that have the potential to support and strengthen its operations. The Company cannot assure it will be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition opportunities, prevail against competing potential acquirers, negotiate appropriate acquisition terms, obtain financing that may be needed to consummate such acquisitions, complete proposed acquisitions, successfully integrate acquired businesses into existing operations or expand into new markets. In addition, the Company cannot assure that any acquisition, once successfully integrated, will perform as planned, be accretive to earnings, or prove to be beneficial to the Company\u2019s operations and cash flows.\nCompliance with, and costs related to, a variety of import and export laws and regulations\nThe Company is subject to a variety of laws regarding international operations, including regulations issued by the U.S. Department of Commerce Bureau of Industry and Security and various foreign governmental agencies. Actual or alleged violations of import-export laws could result in enforcement actions and financial penalties. The Company cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international operations and trading practices might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted. Future regulations could limit the countries in which certain of our products may be manufactured or sold or could restrict our access to, and increase the cost of obtaining, products from foreign sources.\nEnvironmental compliance costs and liabilities\nThe Company\u2019s operations and properties are subject to various, and increasingly numerous, domestic and foreign environmental laws and regulations which can impose operating and financial sanctions for violations. Moreover, environmental and sustainability initiatives, practices, rules and regulations are under increasing scrutiny of both governmental and non-governmental bodies and may require changes in operational practices, standards and expectations and, in turn, increase the Company\u2019s compliance costs. Periodically, the Company has incurred, and expects to continue to incur, operating and capital costs to comply with environmental requirements. The Company monitors its environmental responsibilities, together with trends in the related laws, and believes it is in substantial compliance with current regulations. If the Company is required to incur increased compliance costs or violates environmental laws or regulations, future environmental compliance expenditures or liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nExposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates\nThe Company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly with respect to the Euro, Canadian Dollar, South African Rand and the British Pound. Any significant change in the value of these currencies could affect the Company\u2019s ability to sell products competitively and control its cost structure, which could have a material effect on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nConditions in foreign countries in which the Company conducts business\nIn 2017, 36% of the Company\u2019s sales were to customers outside the United States. The Company expects its international and export sales to continue to be a significant portion of its revenue and it has placed a particular emphasis on increasing its growth and presence internationally. The Company\u2019s sales from international operations and export sales are subject, in varying degrees, to risks inherent to doing business outside the United States. These risks include the following, some of which are further addressed in our other Risk Factors:\n\u2022\nPossibility of unfavorable circumstances arising from host country laws or regulations;\n\u2022\nCurrency exchange rate fluctuations and restrictions on currency repatriation;\n\u2022\nPotential negative consequences from changes to taxation policies;\n\u2022\nDisruption of operations from labor and political disturbances;\n\u2022\nChanges in tariff and trade barriers and import and export licensing requirements;\n\u2022\nIncreased costs and risks of developing, staffing and simultaneously managing a number of global operations as a result of distance as well as language and cultural differences; and\n\u2022\nInsurrections, armed conflicts, terrorism or war.\nAny of these events could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business and operations.\nChanges in our tax rates and exposure to additional income tax liabilities\nOur future effective income tax rates could be unfavorably affected by various factors, including changes in the tax rates as well as rules and regulations in jurisdictions in which we generate income. During the fourth quarter of 2017 the Company recorded, on a provisional basis, the transitional impact of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201cTax Act\u201d) that was enacted on December 22, 2017. Given the significant complexity of the Tax Act, and potential future guidance from the U.S. Treasury, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Financial Accounting Standards Board, these estimates may be adjusted in 2018. In addition, the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by U.S. federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-U.S. authorities. If these audits result in assessments different from amounts recorded, our future financial results may include unfavorable adjustments.\nImpairment in the value of intangible assets, including goodwill\nThe Company\u2019s total assets reflect goodwill from acquisitions, representing the excess cost over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired, including other indefinite-lived and finite-lived intangible assets. Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are reviewed annually for impairment as of October 1 or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate there may be a possible permanent loss of value using either a quantitative or qualitative analysis. Finite-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recovered through future net cash flows generated by the assets. If future operating performance at one or more of the Company\u2019s reporting units were to fall significantly below forecast levels or if market conditions for one or more of its acquired businesses were to decline, the Company could be required to incur a non-cash charge to operating income for impairment. Any impairment in the value of these assets could have an adverse non-cash impact on the Company\u2019s reported results of operations.\nIn 2017 and 2016, the Company recorded pre-tax non-cash goodwill and other intangible impairment charges of $4.1 million and $1.8 million, respectively, related to the Company\u2019s Bayou City Pump Company reporting unit. There was no goodwill or other intangible impairment charges recorded in 2015. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.\nThe Company\u2019s annual impairment analysis concluded that the fair value of the Company\u2019s National Pump Company reporting (\u201cNational\u201d) unit exceeded its carrying value be approximately 7%. A sensitivity analysis was performed for the National reporting unit, assuming a hypothetical 50 basis point decrease in the expected long-term growth rate or a hypothetical 50 basis point increase in the weighted average cost of capital, and both scenarios independently yielded an estimated fair value for the National reporting unit slightly above carrying value. While the result of this test indicated that no impairment existed at National, if recently depressed U.S. agricultural conditions continue for an extended time, the agricultural market\u2019s growth and profitability assumptions may reduce National\u2019s indicated fair value in the future, which could result in an impairment charge. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.\nDefined benefit pension plan settlement expense\nThe Company sponsors a defined benefit pension plan covering certain domestic employees and accrues amounts for funding of its obligations under the plan. The defined benefit pension plan allows eligible retiring employees to receive a lump-sum distribution for benefits earned in lieu of annual payments and most of the Company\u2019s retirees historically have elected this option. Under applicable accounting rules, if the lump-sum distributions made for a plan year exceed an actuarially-determined threshold of the total of the service cost and interest cost for the plan year, the Company at such point would be required to recognize for that year\u2019s results of operations settlement expense for the resulting unrecognized actuarial loss. The Company has been required to make such adjustments in some prior years, and, if such non-cash adjustments are necessary in future periods, they may negatively impact the Company\u2019s operating results.\nIn 2017 and 2015, the Company recorded pre-tax non-cash pension settlement charges of $4.0 million and $3.8 million, respectively, driven by lump-sum distributions discussed above. There was no pension settlement charge recorded in 2016. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits.\nFamily ownership of common equity\nA substantial percentage of the Company\u2019s Common Shares is held by various members of the Gorman and Rupp families and their affiliates. These family holdings historically have not been frequently traded; therefore, the Common Shares, in part because of these circumstances, generally have a history of relatively low volume trading experiences on the NYSE.", "PERMNO": 53604, "SIC": 3561, "TIC": "GRC"}
