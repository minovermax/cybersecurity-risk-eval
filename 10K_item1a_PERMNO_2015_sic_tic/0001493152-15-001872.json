RISK FACTORS.\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risk factors, as well as the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto, before deciding whether to invest in our common stock. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of may become important factors that affect us. If any of these risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or operating results may suffer, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY\nWe have a history of operating losses and substantial indebtedness. Future cash flows from operations and financings may not be sufficient to enable us to meet our obligations under our indebtedness, which likely would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe have incurred significant operating losses in recent years and, as of December 31, 2014, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $70 million. There can be no assurance that we will generate sufficient revenue in the future to cover our expenses and achieve profitability on a consistent basis or at all.\nWe have issued various unsecured promissory notes to finance our acquisition of KBS and provide for our general working capital needs. As of the date of this report, we had outstanding approximately $16.0 million principal amount of debt under promissory notes. This debt included approximately $5.5 million principal under a promissory note issued by our wholly-owned subsidiary KBS Builders, Inc. to the former owner of KBS as partial consideration for the acquisition (the \u201cKBS Note\u201d). We were unable to repay the KBS Note on its maturity date, December 1, 2014, and it remains unpaid as of the date of this report. Our debt also included $6.0 million principal amount of promissory notes issued to Lone Star Value Investors, LP (\u201cLSVI\u201d) and $4.5 million principal amount of promissory notes issued to Lone Star Value Co-Invest I, LP (\u201cLSV Co-Invest I\u201d). Interest on these notes is payable semiannually and any unpaid principal and interest is due on April 1, 2019.\nJeffrey E. Eberwein, our Chairman of the Board, is the founder and Chief Executive Officer of Lone Star Value Management, LLC (\u201cLSVM\u201d), the investment manager of LSVI, and is the manager of Lone Star Value Investors GP, LLC (\u201cLSVGP\u201d), the general partner of LSVI and LSV Co-Invest I.\nWe are seeking to renegotiate the terms of the KBS Note and we intend to pursue new financing to replace the KBS Note and all or a portion of the debt owing to LSVI and LSV Co-Invest I and to provide for our general working capital needs. There can be no assurance we will be successful in obtaining any such new financing with terms favorable to us or at all. Until such time as we obtain such new financing, we may be dependent on LSVI and LSV Co-Invest I, or other third parties, to provide for our general working capital needs. Although not a binding commitment, LSVM has advised us of its present intention to continue to financially support the Company as it pursues new financing.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had cash and cash equivalents of $2.0 million. There can be no assurance that our cash and cash equivalents, together with funds generated by our operations and any future financings, will be sufficient to satisfy our debt payment obligations, including but not limited to our obligation to pay all principal and interest under the KBS Note. Our inability to generate funds or obtain financing sufficient to satisfy our debt payment obligations may result in such obligations being accelerated by our lenders, which would likely have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may need additional financing in order to execute our business plan and our ability to obtain such financing may be limited.\nAs a result of the limited amount of cash and cash equivalents on hand and our debt payment obligations, as well as our lack of a credit facility, we may need additional financing in order to effectively execute our business plan. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain such additional financing, or that if available, it will be available to us on acceptable terms. Due to our history of operating losses and existing debt payment obligations, our ability to obtain such additional financing may be limited.\nThere can be no assurances as to the amount of earn-out payments we will receive from the transfer of our test handler product line to BSA.\nSince we transferred our business of designing, manufacturing, marketing, and servicing a variety of equipment used in the handling of integrated circuits to BSA on April 22, 2014, our ability to generate revenue from the transferred business is limited to the earn-out payments we will receive under the terms of our agreement with BSA. Under the terms of such agreement, no earn-out payments will be earned after December 31, 2018. There can be no assurances of BSA\u2019s ability to generate revenue from the transferred business or of the amount of earn-outs that we will receive under such agreement.\nWe are dependent on our senior management team and other key employees.\nOur success depends, to a significant extent, on our senior management team and other key employees, including the successful integration of KBS management into our senior management team and the ability of other personnel or new hires to effectively replace key employees who may retire or resign. Failure to retain our leadership team and attract and retain new leadership and other important personnel could lead to ineffective management and operations, which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nThe cyclical and seasonal nature of the modular housing industry causes our revenues and operating results to fluctuate, and we expect this cyclicality and seasonality to continue in the future.\nThe modular housing industry is highly cyclical and seasonal and is influenced by many national and regional economic and demographic factors, including the availability of financing for homebuyers and developers, consumer confidence, interest rates, demographic and employment trends, income levels, housing demand, general economic conditions (including inflation and recessions), and the availability of suitable home sites. As a result of the foregoing economic, demographic, and other factors, our revenues and operating results have been volatile, and we expect this volatility to continue in the future. Unfavorable changes in any of the above factors or other issues could have an adverse effect on our revenue and earnings.\nOur operating results could be adversely affected by changes in the cost and availability of raw materials.\nPrices and availability of raw materials used to manufacture our products can change significantly due to fluctuations in supply and demand. Additionally, availability of the raw materials used to manufacture our products may be limited at times resulting in higher prices and/or the need to find alternative suppliers. Furthermore, the cost of raw materials may also be influenced by transportation costs. It is not certain that any price increases can be passed on to our customers without affecting demand or that limited availability of materials will not impact our production capabilities. The state of the financial and housing markets may also impact our suppliers and affect the availability or pricing of materials. Our inability to raise the price of our products in response to increases in prices of raw materials or to maintain a proper supply of raw materials could have an adverse effect on our revenue and earnings.\nWe found material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting were not effective as of December 31, 2014.\nAs disclosed in Part II, Item 9A \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting were not effective as of December 31, 2014 due to material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting related to inadequate accounting processes and internal control procedures. Our failure to successfully remediate these material weaknesses could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and to produce timely and reliable financial information. Additionally, such failure could cause investors to lose confidence in our public disclosures, which could have a negative impact on our stock price. For a discussion of these material weaknesses and our remediation efforts, please see Part II, Item 9A \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe have a few customers that account for a significant portion of our revenues, and the loss of these customers, or decrease in their demand for our products, could have a material adverse effect on our results.\nWe rely on a limited number of customers for a substantial percentage of our net sales and accounts receivable. In 2014, our top three customers accounted for 22%, 17%, and 11% of our net sales, respectively, and our top four customers accounted for 27%, 12%, 10% and 10% of our accounts receivable, respectively. A reduction, delay, or cancellation of orders from one or more of these significant customers, or the loss of one or more of these customers, would likely have an adverse impact on our operating results.\nIf we are unable to maintain or establish relationships with independent dealers and contractors who sell our homes, our revenue could decline.\nDuring fiscal year 2014, approximately 45% of our sales (none of our commercial projects) were made through our network of independent dealers and contractors. As is common in the industry, our independent dealers may also sell homes produced by competing manufacturers and can cancel their relationships with us on short notice. In addition, these dealers may not remain financially solvent, as they are subject to industry, economic, demographic and seasonal trends similar to those faced by us. If we are not able to maintain good relationships with our dealers and contractors or establish relationships with new solvent dealers or contractors, our revenue could decline.\nDue to the nature of our business, many of our expenses are fixed costs and if there are decreases in demand for our products, it may adversely affect our operating results.\nMany of our expenses, particularly those relating to properties, capital equipment, and certain manufacturing overhead items, are fixed in the short term. Reduced demand for our products causes our fixed production costs to be allocated across reduced production volumes, which adversely affects our gross margins and profitability.\nCertain actions taken in connection with reducing operating costs may have a negative impact on our business.\nIn the event of a housing downturn and a decline in our revenues, we may implement cost reduction actions such as temporary factory shutdowns, workforce reductions, pay freezes and reductions, and reductions in other expenditures. In doing so, we will attempt to maintain the necessary infrastructures to allow us to take full advantage of subsequent improvements in market conditions. However, there can be no assurance that reductions we may make in personnel and expenditure levels and the loss of the capabilities of personnel we have terminated or may terminate will not inhibit us in the timely ramp up of production in response to improving market conditions.\nDue to the nature of the work we perform, we may be subject to significant liability claims and disputes.\nWe engage in services that can result in substantial injury or damages that may expose us to legal proceedings, investigations and disputes. For example, in the ordinary course of our business, we may be involved in legal disputes regarding personal injury and wrongful death claims, employee or labor disputes, professional liability claims, and general commercial disputes, as well as other claims. An unfavorable legal ruling against us could result in substantial monetary damages. Although we have adopted a range of insurance, risk management, safety, and risk avoidance programs designed to reduce potential liabilities, there can be no assurance that such programs will protect us fully from all risks and liabilities. If we sustain liabilities that exceed our insurance coverage or for which we are not insured, it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nLegal actions brought against us may adversely affect our operating results and cash flows.\nAs discussed in the Legal Proceedings section of this report, we are a defendant in a lawsuit filed by UTHE Technology Corporation. We believe this lawsuit is without merit and intend to vigorously defend ourselves against all of the allegations in the complaint. However, an unfavorable outcome and/or the costs associated with this and/or other legal proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and cash flows.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR SECURITIES\nThere is a limited market for our common stock.\nThere is a limited public market for our common stock. The average daily trading volume in our common stock during the fiscal year 2014 was approximately 17,000 shares per day. We cannot provide assurances that a more active trading market will develop or be sustained. As a result of low trading volume in our common stock, the purchase or sale of a relatively small number of securities could result in significant price fluctuations and it may be difficult for holders to sell their securities without depressing the market price for such securities.\nWe have received notice from The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (\u201cNasdaq\u201d) that we are not in compliance with certain requirements for continued listing of our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market. If we are not able to regain compliance with such requirements within timeframes set by Nasdaq, or if we otherwise fail to comply with continued listing requirements, our common stock may be delisted.\nOn April 14, 2015, we received a letter from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Department stating that we did not meet the minimum of $2,500,000 in stockholders\u2019 equity required for continued listing of our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1), and that as of April 13, 2015, we did not meet the alternatives of market value of listed securities or net income from continuing operations, and therefore we are not in compliance with Rule 5550(b). We have 45 calendar days from the date of the letter to submit a plan to regain compliance. If Nasdaq accepts the plan, it may grant an extension through October 11, 2015 for us to evidence compliance. We are considering courses of action we may take to regain compliance and intend to submit a plan to Nasdaq within the required timeframe. However, there can be no assurance that our plan will be accepted or that if it is, that we will be able to implement the plan and regain compliance within the required timeframe.\nOn April 7, 2015, we received a separate letter from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Department stating that we are not in compliance with the requirement for continued listing of our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) because we had not yet filed with the SEC our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2014, and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2014. We previously submitted, and Nasdaq accepted, a plan for us to regain compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1), as a result of which Nasdaq granted us an exception until May 13, 2015 to make all required filings with the SEC. In the letter, Nasdaq stated that we were required to submit an update to our original plan and inform Nasdaq of our progress made towards implementing the plan by no later than April 22, 2015. We submitted the update to Nasdaq within the required timeframe and as of the filing of this report have made all required filings with the SEC to date.\nIf we fail to regain compliance with, or otherwise fail to comply with, all applicable continued requirements, Nasdaq may determine to delist our common stock, which could substantially decrease trading in our common stock and adversely affect the market liquidity of our common stock and cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nOur ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income for U.S. income tax purposes may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had federal net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforwards of approximately $90 million and state NOL carryforwards of approximately $35 million. Our ability to use NOLs to offset future taxable income will depend on the amount of taxable income we generate in future periods and whether we become subject to annual limitations on the amount of taxable income that may be offset by our NOLs.\nSection 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), imposes an annual limitation on the amount of taxable income that may be offset by a corporation\u2019s NOLs if the corporation experiences an \u201cownership change\u201d as defined in Section 382 of the Code. An ownership change occurs when the corporation\u2019s \u201cfive-percent shareholders\u201d (as defined in Section 382 of the Code) collectively increase their ownership in the corporation by more than 50 percentage points (by value) over a rolling three-year period. Additionally, various states have similar limitations on the use of state NOLs following an ownership change.\nOur Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation includes provisions designed to protect the tax benefits of our NOLs by generally restricting any direct or indirect transfers of our common stock that increase the direct or indirect ownership of our common stock by any person from less than 4.99% to 4.99% or more, or increase the percentage of our common stock owned directly or indirectly by a person owning or deemed to own 4.99% or more of our common stock. Further, any direct or indirect transfer attempted in violation of these transfer restrictions will be void as of the date of the prohibited transfer as to the purported transferee. Additionally, we have adopted and our shareholders have approved a Tax Benefit Preservation Plan that generally is designed to deter any person from acquiring shares of our common stock if the acquisition would result in such person beneficially owning 4.99% or more of our common stock without the approval of our Board of Directors.\nAlthough these measures are intended to reduce the likelihood of an ownership change, we cannot assure you that they will prevent all transfers of our common stock that could result in such an ownership change. Further, these measures could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or could discourage a third party from acquiring, ATRM or a large block of our common stock, which may adversely affect the marketability, and depress the market price, of our common stock. In addition, these provisions could delay or frustrate the removal of incumbent directors and could make more difficult a merger, tender offer or proxy contest involving us, or impede an attempt to acquire a significant or controlling interest in us, even if such events might be beneficial to us and our shareholders.", "PERMNO": 79472, "SIC": 1520, "TIC": "ATRM"}
