{"cik": "1135906", "company": "EPIRUS Biopharmaceuticals, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-29", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. The risks described below and elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K are some of the important factors that, individually or in the aggregate, we believe could make our actual results differ materially from those described in any forward-looking statements. The risks described below are not the only ones we face. Our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the U.S. and globally, as well as other risks that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations.\nIn the following discussion of risk factors, references to \"Zalicus\" refer to the business of Zalicus Inc. as it existed prior to the merger on July 15, 2014, and references to \"Private Epirus\" refer to the business of EPIRUS Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. prior to the merger on July 15, 2014. References to \"we,\" \"us,\" \"our,\" and similar terms refer to the combined business of EPIRUS Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. after the merger on July 15, 2014.\nRisks Related to Financial Results, Need for Additional Financing and Debt Arrangements\nWe have a history of operating losses. We expect to incur significant operating losses and may never be profitable. Our common stock is a highly speculative investment.\nPrior to the July 15, 2014 merger with Zalicus Inc. (the \u201cMerger\u201d), we incurred operating losses since its inception, and was never cash-positive. Similarly, following the Merger, we have continued to incur net losses and has not been cash-positive. As of December 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of $138.8 million. We have spent, and expect to continue to spend, significant resources to fund research and development of our product candidates and to enhance our drug development technologies. We expect to incur substantial operating losses over the next several years due to our ongoing research, development, pre-clinical testing, and clinical trial activities. As a result, our accumulated deficit will continue to increase.\nExcept for BOW015, our product candidates are in the early stages of development and may never result in any revenue. We will not be able to generate product revenue unless we or our partners successfully commercialize BOW015 or our early stage product candidates. We may seek to obtain revenue from collaboration or licensing agreements with third parties. Our current collaboration and license agreements may not provide us with material, sustainable ongoing future revenue, and we may not be able to enter into additional collaboration agreements. Even if we eventually generate product revenues, we may never be profitable, and if we ever achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain it.\nWe will require substantial additional funds in the near term to continue as a going concern, and to obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize our current and any future biosimilar product candidates and, if additional capital is not available, we may need to limit, scale back or cease our operations.\nSince our inception, we have devoted substantial resources to the nonclinical and clinical development of our most advanced biosimilar product candidate, BOW015, a proposed biosimilar of Remicade\u00ae (infliximab). We will incur substantial costs for our global clinical program for BOW015, which we initiated in February 2016. We believe that we will continue to expend substantial resources for the foreseeable future for the clinical development of our current pipeline of biosimilar product candidates, including for development of any other indications and product candidates we may choose to pursue. These expenditures will include costs associated with research and development, conducting nonclinical studies and clinical trials, and manufacturing and supply as well as marketing and selling any products approved for sale. In addition, other unanticipated costs may arise. Because the outcome of any clinical trial is highly\nuncertain, we cannot reasonably estimate the actual amounts necessary to successfully complete the development and commercialization of BOW015 in all of the markets in which we plan to commercialize the product and our pipeline of other product candidates.\nWe believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our operations into the second quarter of 2016. As of December 31, 2015, our total unrestricted cash and cash equivalents was $31.5 million. We will need to raise additional capital in the near term to fund our operating requirements and continue as a going concern. We may also seek to raise additional funds if our research and development expenses exceed current expectations, our collaboration funding is less than current assumptions or expectations, or we encounter obstacles to our development and commercialization of our product candidates that were not anticipated. This could occur for many reasons, including:\n\uf0b7 our product candidates require more extensive clinical or pre-clinical testing, our research and development programs for our product candidates do not proceed as expected, our clinical trials take longer to complete than we currently expect or our clinical trials are not successful;\n\uf0b7 we advance more of our product candidates than expected into costly later stage clinical trials;\n\uf0b7 we advance more of our pre-clinical product candidates than expected into early stage clinical trials;\n\uf0b7 our revenue-generating collaboration agreements are terminated;\n\uf0b7 we are unable to reduce our cost structure while simultaneously pursuing new business opportunities and enhancing other aspects of our business;\n\uf0b7 the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals are higher than anticipated in one or more jurisdictions where we are seeking to manufacture and/or market our products;\n\uf0b7 some or all of our product candidates fail in clinical or pre-clinical studies or prove to be less commercially promising than we expect or we are forced to seek additional product candidates;\n\uf0b7 we are required, or consider it advisable, to acquire or license rights from one or more third parties;\n\uf0b7 we determine to enter into additional business combinations or acquire or license rights to additional product candidates or new technologies;\n\uf0b7 the cost of regulatory, manufacturing and commercialization activities, if any, relating to our product candidates, are higher, or take longer to establish than anticipated; or\n\uf0b7 we are subject to litigation in relation to our activities with respect to our product candidates, including potential patent litigation with innovator companies or others who may hold patents.\nThese factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern. The factors describe above coupled with our recurring losses from operations and our stockholders\u2019 deficit raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. As a result, our independent registered public accounting firm included an explanatory paragraph in its report on our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 with respect to this uncertainty. The perception that we may not be able to continue as a going concern may cause others to choose not to deal with us due to concerns about our ability to meet our contractual obligations and may adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital.\nWhile we expect to seek additional funding through public or private financings, we may not be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, the terms of any financings may be dilutive to, or otherwise adversely affect, holders of our common stock. We may also seek additional funds through arrangements with collaborators or others. These arrangements would generally require us to relinquish rights to some of our technologies, product candidates or products, and we may not be able to enter into such agreements on acceptable terms, if at all. The arrangements also may include issuances of equity, which may also be dilutive to, or otherwise adversely affect, holders of our common stock. There can be no assurance that we will be able to access equity or credit markets in order to finance our operations or expand development programs for any of our product candidates, or that there will not be a deterioration in financial markets and confidence in economies that could make it difficult or impossible to access these markets. We may also have to scale back or further restructure our operations. If we are unable to obtain additional funding on a timely basis, we may be required to curtail or terminate some or all of our research or development programs.\nWith the filing of this annual report on Form 10-K, unless and until the value of our public float (which refers to the shares held by shareholders who are not affiliates of ours) increases to an amount equal to or greater than $75 million, we will be subject to limitations imposed by SEC rules on the value of shares we may issue pursuant to our Form S-3 shelf registration statement in a primary offering. Specifically, SEC rules provide that a company with less than $75 million in public float may issue securities with a value of no more than one-third of the company\u2019s public float value in any twelve-month period. This may further affect the amount of capital we can raise to pursue the development of our programs.\nOur term loans include certain covenants and other events of default. Should we not comply with these covenants or incur an event of default, we may be required to repay our obligation in cash, which could have an adverse effect on our liquidity.\nOur term loans from Hercules Technology Growth Capital, Inc. include certain customary covenants, including limitations on other indebtedness, liens, acquisitions, investments and dividends.\nIf we fail to stay in compliance with our covenants or suffer some other event of default under the term loans, we may be required to repay the outstanding principal. Should this occur, our liquidity would be adversely impacted.\nThe requirements of being a public company have required and will continue to require significant resources, increase our costs and occupy our management\u2019s time and efforts, and we may be unable to continue to comply with these requirements in a timely or cost-effective manner.\nOur merger with Zalicus was determined to constitute a reverse acquisition and Private Epirus, a privately held company, was determined to be the acquirer for accounting purposes. Although Zalicus was an operating company, its operations were deemphasized following the consummation of the merger with the post-merger entity, which focuses on Private Epirus\u2019 biosimilar business. Because the financial statements and information relating to Private Epirus now constitute our financial statements and information, we are in a position similar to a newly public company.\nAs a company with public reporting responsibilities, we have incurred and will continue to incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses that Private Epirus did not incur as a private company. Complying with rules, regulations and requirements applicable to public companies has required substantial effort and has increased and may continue to increase our costs and expenses. We have been required to:\n\uf0b7 institute a more formalized function of internal control over financial reporting;\n\uf0b7 prepare, file and distribute periodic and current reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act, and comply with other Exchange Act requirements applicable to public companies;\n\uf0b7 formalize old and establish new internal policies, such as those relating to insider trading and disclosure controls and procedures;\n\uf0b7 involve and retain to a greater degree outside counsel and accountants in the above activities; and\n\uf0b7 establish and maintain an investor relations function, including the provision of certain information on our website.\nCompliance with these rules and regulations has increased, and will continue to increase, our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly. For example, these rules and regulations have made it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we have been required to incur substantial costs to maintain the same or similar coverage.\nIn connection with our merger, the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, granted us a waiver of the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, for a period of one year, and therefore we were not required to make a formal assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting for that purpose until the filing of this annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2015. In anticipation of this formal assessment, we have been required to comply with Section 404 since January 1, 2015. In connection with the audit of our 2015 financial statements and in connection with the preparation of certain of our 2014 interim financial statements, our management team and independent registered public accounting firm identified certain weaknesses in our internal controls that were considered to be material weaknesses. For a discussion of our internal control over financial reporting and a description of the identified material weaknesses, see \"Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\" under Item 9A, \"Controls and Procedures.\"\nOur management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, excluding the internal controls of Bioceros, B.V., which the Company acquired on September 9, 2015. This assessment identified material weaknesses in our internal control over our financial statement close process and the financial reporting processes related to business combinations, income taxes and accrued development costs. Because of these material weaknesses, management believes that, as of December 31, 2015, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective based on those criteria.\nWe may subsequently identify additional errors or deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting, including any such errors or deficiencies in connection with the Bioceros financial statements that are deemed to be material weaknesses, such as the material weakness discussed in the other risk factors described in this section. Additionally, in complying with Section 404, we have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, significant expenses and devote substantial management effort toward ensuring compliance with these requirements. If we are not able to comply with these requirements in a timely manner, or if we identify deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, the market price of our common stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which would entail expenditure of additional financial and management resources. See \u201cRisks Related to an Investment in Our Common Stock-Our management and independent auditors have identified material weaknesses in our internal controls, and we may be unable to develop, implement and maintain appropriate internal and disclosure controls in future periods, which may lead to errors or omissions in our financial statements.\u201d\nOur international operations subject us to potentially adverse tax consequences.\nWe generally conduct our international operations through wholly-owned subsidiaries and report our taxable income in various jurisdictions worldwide based upon our business operations in those jurisdictions. Our intercompany relationships are subject to complex transfer pricing regulations administered by taxing authorities in various jurisdictions. The relevant taxing authorities may disagree with our determinations as to the income and expenses attributable to specific jurisdictions. If such a disagreement were to occur, and our position were not sustained, we could be required to pay additional taxes, interest and penalties, which could result in one-time tax charges, higher effective tax rates, reduced cash flows and lower overall profitability of our operations.\nRisks Relating to the Development, Manufacturing and Commercialization of Our Products\nWe are largely dependent on the success of BOW015. All of our other product candidates are still in pre-clinical development. If we are unable to obtain regulatory approval in additional jurisdictions for, or successfully commercialize, BOW015, our business will be materially harmed.\nOur business prospects and potential product revenues are largely dependent upon our ability to obtain regulatory approval of, and successfully commercialize, BOW015. We have reported positive bioequivalence and efficacy data in the clinical development program for BOW015, including a Phase 1 clinical trial in the United Kingdom and a Phase 3 clinical trial in India, in each case showing equivalence with Remicade as the reference product. We also announced positive 58 week follow up data from the Phase 3 trial. In this open label phase, we demonstrated that patients can be initiated and maintained on BOW015 for 58 weeks, and that patients can be switched from Remicade to BOW015 and maintained out to 58 weeks, with a favorable safety and efficacy profile. In March 2014, our manufacturing partner, Reliance Life Sciences Pvt Ltd, or RLS, obtained marketing approval on our behalf in India for BOW015 for rheumatoid arthritis on the basis of our Phase 3 trial, and in September 2014, RLS received final manufacturing and market approval on our behalf from the Drug Controller General of India, or the DCGI. We currently have an agreement to commercialize BOW015 in India with our partner Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., or Sun, and in November 2014, we launched BOW015 in India with Sun. As discussed in the other risk factors described in this section, we settled a dispute with RLS that may adversely affect our ability to rely on the approvals that have been obtained by RLS for our benefit and that we currently rely upon for selling BOW015 in India. In the event that the DCGI does not approve the transfer of the marketing approval to us or our designee, pursuant to the terms of our Settlement Agreement with RLS (as described below) and it becomes necessary to obtain new manufacturing and marketing approvals from the DCGI, no assurance can be given as to whether we or our partners will be able to obtain the required approvals or that any such approvals will be obtained in a timely manner. If Sun encounters delays or difficulties in commercializing BOW015 pursuant to our agreement, it may adversely affect our ability to successfully commercialize BOW015 in India. Additionally, in conjunction with other potential partners with whom we may form alliances, we intend to file for regulatory approval in additional markets where our current data are expected to be sufficient for approval. In February 2016, we initiated this global clinical program, which we refer to as the UNIFORM Study. The UNIFORM Study is a 58-week, double-blind, one-to-one randomized, comparator-controlled multi-center global study to compare safety, efficacy and immunogenicity and demonstrate clinical equivalence of BOW015 with Remicade. As discussed in the other risk factors described in this section, obtaining regulatory approval is costly and uncertain. Even if we obtain regulatory approval for BOW015 in a jurisdiction, we may not be successful in commercializing it in the jurisdiction. If we fail to successfully commercialize BOW015, or encounter significant delays in doing so, we may be required to curtail or terminate some or all of our research or development programs and our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations would be materially harmed. To date, we have not yet commercialized BOW015 in any of our target markets other than India.\nOur other product candidates, BOW050, BOW070, BOW080, BOW090 and BOW100 are in pre-clinical development. Before we can commercialize these product candidates we need to:\n\uf0b7 conduct substantial research and development;\n\uf0b7 undertake nonclinical and clinical testing, for the purpose of demonstrating bioequivalence with the applicable reference products, and engage in sampling activity and other costly and time consuming measures;\n\uf0b7 scale-up manufacturing processes; and\n\uf0b7 pursue and obtain marketing and manufacturing approvals and, in some jurisdictions, pricing and reimbursement approvals.\nThis process involves a high degree of risk and takes many years, and success is never guaranteed. Our product development efforts with respect to these product candidates may fail for many reasons, including:\n\uf0b7 failure of the product candidate in nonclinical studies, including those required to demonstrate bioequivalence with the reference product;\n\uf0b7 inability to obtain on a timely basis supplies of the applicable reference products to which our product candidates must be compared;\n\uf0b7 delays or difficulty enrolling patients in clinical trials, particularly for disease indications with small patient populations;\n\uf0b7 patients exhibiting adverse reactions to the product candidate or indications of other safety concerns;\n\uf0b7 insufficient clinical trial data to support the bioequivalence of one or more of our product candidates with the applicable reference product;\n\uf0b7 inability to manufacture sufficient quantities of the product candidate for development or commercialization activities in a timely and cost-efficient manner, if at all;\n\uf0b7 potential patent litigation with innovator companies or others who may hold patents;\n\uf0b7 failure to obtain, or delays in obtaining, the required regulatory approvals for the product candidate, the facilities or the processes used to manufacture the product candidate; or\n\uf0b7 changes in the regulatory environment, including pricing and reimbursement that make development of our biosimilar product candidates or development of such product candidates for a new indication no longer desirable.\nIf our product development efforts fail for any of these or other reasons, or we decide to abandon development of a product candidate at any time, we would never realize revenue from those programs and our business could be materially harmed.\nIf an improved version of a reference product, such as Remicade, is developed, or if the market for a reference product significantly declines, sales or potential sales of our biosimilar product candidates may suffer.\nWe are developing and commercializing follow-on versions of approved, reference biological products. Such follow-on products are known as biosimilars. Innovator companies may develop improved versions of a reference product as part of a life cycle extension strategy, and may obtain regulatory approval of the improved version under a new or supplemental application filed with the applicable regulatory authority. Should the innovator company succeed in obtaining an approval of an improved biologic product, it may capture a significant share of the collective reference product market in the applicable jurisdiction and significantly reduce the market for the reference product and thereby the potential size of the market for our product candidates. In addition, the improved product may be protected by additional patent rights and thereby subject our follow-on biosimilar to claims of infringement.\nAdditionally, competition in the biotechnology industry is intense. Reference biologic products face competition on numerous fronts as technological advances are made that may offer patients a more convenient form of administration or increased efficacy, or as new products are introduced. As new products are approved that compete with the reference products to our biosimilar product candidates, such as Remicade, or our pipeline products, such as Humira and others, sales of the reference biologic products may be significantly and adversely impacted and may render the reference products obsolete. If the market for the reference product is impacted, we in turn may lose significant market share or market potential for our biosimilar products and product candidates, and the value for our product pipeline could be negatively impacted. As a result of the above factors, our business, prospects and financial condition could suffer.\nOur biosimilar product candidates, if approved, will face significant competition from the reference products and from other biosimilars approved for the same indication as the reference biologic products. Our failure to effectively compete may prevent us from achieving significant market penetration and expansion.\nOur business involves highly competitive pharmaceutical and biotechnology markets. Successful competitors in the pharmaceutical market have the ability to effectively discover, obtain patents, develop, test and obtain regulatory approvals for products, as well as the ability to effectively commercialize, market and promote approved products, including communicating the effectiveness, safety and value of products to actual and prospective customers and medical staff. Numerous companies, universities, and other research institutions are engaged in developing, patenting, manufacturing and marketing of products competitive with those that we are developing. Many of these potential competitors, such as Celltrion, Inc. and Hospira, Inc. (acquired by Pfizer, Inc.), are large, experienced companies that enjoy significant competitive advantages, such as substantially greater financial, research and development, manufacturing, personnel and marketing resources, greater brand recognition and more experience and expertise in undertaking nonclinical testing and clinical trials of product candidates, and obtaining regulatory approvals of products. If we do not effectively compete with these potential competitors, the value of our product pipeline could be negatively impacted and our business, prospects and financial condition could suffer.\nUse of our product candidates could be associated with side effects or adverse events.\nAs with most pharmaceutical and biological drug products, use of our product candidates could be associated with side effects or adverse events, which can vary in severity (from minor reactions to death) and frequency. Side effects or adverse events associated with the use of our product candidates or those of our collaborators may be observed at any time, including in clinical trials or later when a product is commercialized, and any such side effects or adverse events may negatively affect our ability to obtain regulatory approvals or market our product candidates. Side effects such as toxicity or other safety issues associated with the use of our product candidates could require us or our collaborators to halt development or sale of these product candidates or expose us to product liability lawsuits that would harm our business. We may also be required by regulatory agencies to conduct additional nonclinical studies or clinical trials that we have not planned or anticipated. There can be no assurance that we will resolve any issues related to any product-related adverse events to the satisfaction of any regulatory agency in a jurisdiction where we are seeking to commercialize our products or obtain approval in a timely manner or ever, which could harm our business, prospects and financial condition.\nIn addition, if we are successful in commercializing the most advanced biosimilar in our pipeline, BOW015, or any other of our pipeline product candidates, then laws and regulations may require that we report certain information about adverse medical events according to timelines that may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. The timing of our obligation to report may be triggered by the date we become aware of the adverse event as well as the nature of the event. We may fail to report adverse events we become aware of within the prescribed timeframe. We may also fail to appreciate that we have become aware of a reportable adverse event, especially if it is not reported to us as an adverse event or if it is an adverse event that is unexpected or removed in time from the use of our products. If we fail to comply with our reporting obligations, regulatory agencies could take action including, without limitation, criminal prosecution, the imposition of civil monetary penalties, seizure of our products, or delay in approval of future products. Any of the foregoing scenarios could materially harm the commercial prospects for our product candidates.\nWe may have significant product liability exposure that may harm our business and our reputation.\nAlthough our product candidates are biosimilar products, and are designed to be equivalent against reference products that have an established safety record in the indications in which they are marketed and used, we face a risk of product liability as a result of the clinical testing of our product candidates and will face an even greater risk as we commercialize our products. For example, we may incur liability if any product we develop allegedly causes injury or is found to be otherwise unsuitable during product testing, manufacturing, marketing or sale. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product, negligence, strict liability and a breach of warranties. Claims could also be asserted under state consumer protection acts or comparable statutes abroad. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims,\nwe may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization of our products. Regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\uf0b7 decreased demand for BOW015, or any future product candidates that may obtain regulatory approval;\n\uf0b7 injury to our reputation and significant negative media attention;\n\uf0b7 withdrawal of clinical trial participants or cancellation of clinical trials;\n\uf0b7 costs to defend the related litigation;\n\uf0b7 a diversion of management\u2019s time and our resources;\n\uf0b7 substantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;\n\uf0b7 regulatory investigations, product recalls, withdrawals or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions;\n\uf0b7 loss of revenue; and\n\uf0b7 the inability to commercialize any products we develop.\nOur inability to obtain and maintain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable cost and scope of coverage to protect against potential product liability claims could impact the commercialization of BOW015, and any of our other product candidates. We currently carry product liability insurance covering our clinical trials in the amount of $5 million in the aggregate. Although we maintain such insurance, any claim that may be brought against us could result in a court judgment or settlement in an amount that is not covered, in whole or in part, by our insurance or that is in excess of the limits of our insurance coverage. Our insurance policies also have various exclusions and deductibles, and we may be subject to a product liability claim for which we have no coverage. We will have to pay any amounts awarded by a court or negotiated in a settlement that exceed our coverage limitations or that are not covered by our insurance, and we may not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient capital to pay such amounts. Moreover, in the future, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses in all the jurisdictions in which we seek to market and sell our products. As we obtain approvals for marketing BOW015 and any other product candidates in more jurisdictions, we intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of such products; however, we may be unable to obtain this liability insurance on commercially reasonable terms.\nIf we fail to attract and keep senior management and key scientific personnel, we may be unable to successfully develop our pipeline product candidates, conduct our clinical trials and commercialize BOW015, or any future pipeline product candidates we develop.\nOur success depends in large part on our continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified management, clinical and scientific personnel. We believe that our future success is highly dependent upon the contributions of our senior management, particularly our chief executive officer, chief financial officer, chief technical officer, vice president of program management, and vice president of manufacturing and quality, as well as our senior scientists and other members of our senior management team. The loss of services of any of these individuals could delay or prevent the successful development of our product pipeline, completion of our planned clinical trials or the commercialization of BOW015, or any future products we develop.\nAlthough we have not historically experienced significant difficulties attracting and retaining qualified employees, we could experience such problems in the future. For example, competition for qualified personnel in the biotechnology and pharmaceuticals field is intense due to the limited number of individuals who possess the skills and experience required by our industry. We will need to hire additional personnel as we expand our process and clinical development and commercial activities. We may not be able to attract and retain quality personnel on acceptable terms, or at all, which may cause our business and operating results to suffer.\nWe expect to enter into alliances with other companies that can provide capabilities and funds for the development and commercialization of our product candidates, as well as local market access in jurisdictions where we intend to pursue our In Market, For Market commercialization strategy. If we are unsuccessful in forming or maintaining these alliances on favorable terms, or if such alliances do not prove to be as successful as we anticipate, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur In Market, For Market strategy for development and commercialization of our biosimilar product candidates in key emerging markets is based on the assumption that we will enter into collaborative relationships with local entities to facilitate our access to and penetration into such markets. We also have limited or no capabilities for independent manufacturing, sales, marketing and distribution. In September 2014, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Livzon MabPharm Inc., or Livzon, for the development and commercialization of BOW015 and other pipeline biosimilar products to be agreed with Livzon in China, using our In Market, For Market strategy, and in September 2015, added BOW070 as a product candidate to be developed pursuant to the terms of this collaboration agreement. We retain global rights to commercialize BOW015, BOW070 and the other pipeline biosimilar products outside of China, subject to our other agreements with third parties.\nIn the future, we expect to form additional alliances with other companies that are based in our target markets and that have expertise in development, manufacture and commercialization of biologics and biosimilar products in our target markets to enable us to expand the commercialization opportunities for our product candidates. In such alliances, we would expect our partners to provide substantial capabilities in clinical development, manufacturing, regulatory affairs, sales and marketing. We may not be successful in entering into any such alliances. Even if we do succeed in securing such alliances, we may not be able to maintain them if, for example, development or approval of a product candidate is delayed or sales of an approved product are disappointing. If we are unable to secure or maintain such alliances we may not have the capabilities necessary to continue or complete development of our product candidates and bring them to market, which may have an adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition to product development and commercialization capabilities, we may depend on our alliances with other companies, such as our current alliances with Livzon, Polpharma, and Mabxience, among others, to provide substantial additional funding for development and potential commercialization of our product candidates. We may not be able to obtain funding on favorable terms from these alliances, and if we are not successful in doing so, we may not have sufficient funds to develop a particular product candidate internally, or to bring product candidates to market. Failure to bring our product candidates to market would prevent us from generating sales revenue, and this would substantially harm our business. Furthermore, any delay in entering into these alliances could delay the development and commercialization of our product candidates and reduce their competitiveness even if they reach the market. As a result, our business may be adversely affected.\nFailure to obtain or maintain adequate coverage and reimbursement for our product candidates could limit our ability to market those products and decrease our ability to generate revenue.\nSales of our product candidates will depend substantially, both domestically and abroad, on the extent to which our product candidates will be covered by third party payors such as private health insurers, managed care organizations, and government healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid and the adequacy of the payments for those products. If coverage and reimbursement are not available, or are available only to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our product candidates. Because there are not many approved biosimilars available, many countries and payors have not yet established policies for the coverage and payment for those types of drugs, even if the reference biologic is covered. Moreover, even if coverage is provided, the approved reimbursement amount may not be high enough to allow us to establish or maintain pricing sufficient to realize a return on our investment.\nThere is significant uncertainty related to the insurance coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products. In the United States, third-party payors, including private and governmental payors, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs, play an important role in determining the extent to which new drugs and biologics will be covered and reimbursed. The Medicare program covers most individuals aged 65 or older, individuals suffering from end-stage renal disease and certain disabled individuals. The Medicaid program, which varies from state-to-state, covers individuals and families who have limited financial means or meet other eligibility requirements. Medicare is often used\nas a model for how private payors and other governmental payors develop their coverage and reimbursement policies for drugs and biologics. It is difficult to predict at this time what third-party payors will decide with respect to the coverage and reimbursement for our product candidates.\nOutside the United States, international operations are generally subject to extensive governmental price controls and other market regulations, and we believe the increasing emphasis on cost-containment initiatives in Europe, Canada, and other countries has and will continue to put pressure on the pricing and usage of our product candidates. In many countries, the prices of medical products are subject to varying price control mechanisms as part of national health systems. In general, the prices of medicines under such systems are substantially lower than in the United States. Other countries allow companies to fix their own prices for medical products, but monitor and control company profits. Additional foreign price controls or other changes in pricing regulation could restrict the amount that we are able to charge for our product candidates. Accordingly, in markets outside the United States, the reimbursement for our products may be reduced compared with the United States and may be insufficient to generate commercially reasonable revenues and profits.\nMoreover, increasing efforts by governmental and third-party payors in the United States and abroad to cap or reduce healthcare costs may cause such organizations to limit both coverage and the level of reimbursement for new products approved and, as a result, they may not cover or provide adequate payment for our product candidates. We expect to experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of any of our product candidates due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations and additional legislative changes. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs and surgical procedures and other treatments, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products.\nHealthcare legislative reform measures may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIn the United States, there have been and continue to be a number of legislative initiatives to contain healthcare costs. For example, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or the Affordable Care Act, was passed, which substantially changes the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. The Affordable Care Act, among other things, subjects biologic products to potential competition by lower-cost biosimilars, addresses a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, increases the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extends the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, establishes annual fees and taxes on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs, and a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer\u2019s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D.\nWe expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product candidates or additional pricing pressures.\nWe may be subject, directly or indirectly, to federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws, false claims laws, and health information privacy and security laws. If we are unable to comply, or have not fully complied, with such laws, we could face substantial penalties.\nIf we obtain approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for any of our product candidates and begin commercializing those products in the United States, our operations may be directly, or indirectly through our customers, subject to various federal and state fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal False Claims Act, and physician sunshine laws and regulations. These laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales, marketing, and education programs. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include:\n\uf0b7 the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce, or in return for, the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;\n\uf0b7 federal, civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent;\n\uf0b7 the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and making false statements relating to healthcare matters;\n\uf0b7 HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, which imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n\uf0b7 the federal physician sunshine requirements under the Affordable Care Act, which require manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies to report annually to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians, other healthcare providers, and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and other healthcare providers and their immediate family members and applicable group purchasing organizations; and\n\uf0b7 state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws that may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nBecause of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our current or future business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. In addition, recent health care reform legislation has strengthened these laws. For example, the Affordable Care Act, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal anti-kickback and criminal healthcare fraud statutes. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it. Moreover, the Affordable Care Act provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act.\nIf our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from participation in government health care programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, imprisonment of our employees, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.\nFailure to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and other similar anti-corruption laws and anti-money laundering laws, as well as export control laws, customs laws, sanctions laws and other laws governing our operations could subject us to significant penalties and damage our reputation.\nWe are subject to the FCPA, which generally prohibits U.S. companies and intermediaries acting on their behalf from offering or making corrupt payments to \u201cforeign officials\u201d for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or securing an improper business advantage. The FCPA also requires companies whose securities are publicly listed in the United States to maintain accurate books and records and to maintain adequate internal accounting controls. We are also subject to other similar anti-corruption laws and anti-money laundering laws, as well as export control laws, customs laws, sanctions laws and other laws that apply to our activities in the countries where we operate. Certain of the jurisdictions in which we conduct or expect to conduct business have heightened risks for public corruption, extortion, bribery, pay-offs, theft and other fraudulent practices. In addition, our international business is heavily regulated and therefore involves significant interactions with \u201cforeign officials.\u201d We are also subject to other federal statutes and regulations, including those established by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC. In many countries, health care professionals who serve as investigators in our clinical studies, or prescribe or purchase our commercialized products, are employed by a government or an entity owned or controlled by a government. Dealings with these investigators, prescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the FCPA. Under these laws and regulations, as well as other anti-corruption laws, anti-money-laundering laws, export control laws, customs laws, sanctions laws and other laws governing our operations, various government agencies may require export licenses, may seek to impose modifications to business practices, including cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries or with sanctioned persons or entities and modifications to compliance programs, which may increase compliance costs, and may subject us to fines, penalties and other sanctions.\nRecent events in Ukraine and Crimea have resulted in the European Union and the United States imposing and escalating sanctions on Russia and certain businesses, sectors and individuals in Russia. The European Union and the United States have also suspended the granting of certain types of export licenses to Russia. Russia has imposed its own sanctions on certain individuals in the United States and may impose other sanctions on the United States and the European Union and/or certain businesses or individuals from these regions. Although our products are not currently subject to such sanctions, we cannot assure you that the current sanctions or any further sanctions imposed by the European Union, the United States or other international interests will not materially adversely affect our operations. We rely on local and strategic business partners and collaborators to produce and commercialize our products in certain markets outside of the United States, and we rely on distributors and other intermediaries to sell and distribute our products internationally.\nWe maintain policies, procedures and internal controls designed to promote compliance with the FCPA, OFAC restrictions and other anti-corruption laws and anti-money laundering laws, as well as export control laws, customs laws, sanctions laws and other laws. However, if we, our business partners, collaborators or intermediaries fail to comply with the requirements of the FCPA, OFAC restrictions or similar laws of other countries, or our controls and procedures fail to detect such noncompliance, governmental authorities in the United States or elsewhere, as applicable, could seek to impose civil penalties, criminal fines, and other collateral consequences. As we continue to expand internationally, there continues to be risk that the policies, procedures and internal controls on which we currently rely to promote compliance with these laws, regulations and restrictions will fail to be sufficiently effective and we will need to continue to develop those policies. A violation of these laws or regulations could damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, contract research organizations, or CROs, consultants and collaborators may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements and insider trading.\nWe are exposed to the risk that our employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, CROs, consultants and collaborators may engage in fraudulent conduct or other illegal activity. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional, reckless and/or negligent conduct or unauthorized activities that violate: (1) regulations of regulatory authorities in jurisdictions where we are performing activities in relation to our product candidates, including those laws requiring the reporting of true, complete and accurate information to such authorities; (2) manufacturing regulations and standards; (3) applicable regulatory laws prohibiting the promotion of a medical product for a use that has not been cleared or approved by the applicable regulator; (4) fraud and abuse, anti-corruption laws and anti-money laundering laws, as well as similar laws and regulations and other laws; or (5) laws that require the reporting of true and accurate financial information and data. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare\nindustry are subject to extensive laws and regulations, as well as various corruption investigations, intended to prevent fraud, bias, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices, and these laws may differ substantially from country to country. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Misconduct by these parties could also include the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. While we have in place a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, it is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by employees and other third parties. Moreover, the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling misconduct or preventing governmental investigations or proceedings or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business including the imposition of significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, possible exclusion from participation in subsidized healthcare programs in a given country, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Approvals\nThe regulatory approval process is costly and lengthy and, for biosimilar products, still evolving. We may not be able to successfully obtain all required regulatory approvals or may be delayed in commercializing our products even after regulatory approvals are obtained.\nThe pre-clinical development, clinical trials, manufacturing, marketing, testing, approval, and labeling of pharmaceutical and biological products, including biosimilars, are all subject to extensive regulation by numerous regulatory authorities throughout the world. We or our collaborators must obtain regulatory approval for product candidates before marketing or selling any of them. The approval process is typically lengthy and expensive, and approval is never certain. Moreover, only one biosimilar has been approved in the United States to date, and few biosimilars have been approved in other countries. It is not possible to predict with any specificity how long the approval processes of the applicable regulatory authorities for any of our products will take or whether any such approvals ultimately will be granted on a timely basis or at all. Moreover, we expect to seek regulatory approvals in jurisdictions in which we have limited experience navigating the regulatory frameworks, or where the regulatory frameworks for the approval of biosimilars are not well-developed and are constantly evolving. In particular, the regulatory standards applicable to establish biosimilarity vary by jurisdiction. The last ten years have seen the establishment in many jurisdictions of a formal regulatory process for review and approval of biosimilar products, but these procedures are at differing stages of development, with limited harmonization among major jurisdictions. We plan to continue to analyze and incorporate into our biosimilar development plans any new laws, regulations, or policies promulgated or established by relevant authorities. The costs of development and approval, along with the probability of success for our biosimilar product candidates, will be dependent upon application of any laws and regulations issued by the relevant regulatory authorities.\nRegulatory agencies generally have substantial discretion in the biologic and biosimilar approval processes, and positive results in pre-clinical testing or early phases of clinical trials offer no assurance of success in later phases of such tests or trials. Generally, pre-clinical and clinical testing of products can take many years and require the expenditure of substantial resources, and the data obtained from these tests and trials can be susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. Any delay in obtaining, or failure to obtain, approvals could prevent or adversely affect the marketing of our products or our collaborator\u2019s products and our ability to generate product revenue. The risks associated with the approval process include delays or rejections in the regulatory approval process based on the failure of clinical or other data to meet expectations, or the failure of the product or candidate to meet a regulatory agency\u2019s requirements for safety, efficacy and quality.\nClinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons, including delays related to:\n\uf0b7 ongoing discussions with the regulatory authorities regarding the scope or design of clinical trials;\n\uf0b7 delays or the inability to obtain required approvals from institutional review committees or ethics committees at clinical sites selected for participation in our clinical trials;\n\uf0b7 delays in enrolling patients and volunteers into clinical trials;\n\uf0b7 lower than anticipated retention rates of patients and volunteers in clinical trials;\n\uf0b7 the need to repeat clinical trials as a result of inconclusive or negative results or poorly executed testing;\n\uf0b7 lack of sufficient funds for further clinical development;\n\uf0b7 insufficient supply or deficient quality of product candidate materials or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials;\n\uf0b7 unsatisfactory regulatory inspection of a manufacturing, testing, labeling or packaging facility;\n\uf0b7 unsatisfactory regulatory inspection of a clinical trial site or the records generated or maintained by such site;\n\uf0b7 serious and unexpected drug-related side effects or serious adverse safety events experienced by participants in clinical trials or by patients following commercialization; or\n\uf0b7 the placement of a clinical hold on a product candidate in a proposed or an ongoing clinical trial.\nWe may not be able to conduct clinical trials at preferred sites, enlist clinical investigators, enroll sufficient numbers of patients, or demonstrate equivalence of our product candidates with the applicable reference products, or begin or successfully complete clinical trials in a timely fashion, if at all. Any failure to perform may delay or terminate the trials. Our current clinical trials may be insufficient to demonstrate that our potential products are equivalent to the applicable reference products, or sufficiently active, safe, or effective and as a result we may decide to abandon further development of such product candidates. Additional clinical trials may be required if clinical trial results are negative or inconclusive, or insufficient to obtain regulatory approval in one or more countries under applicable laws regulating biosimilar products, which will require us to incur additional costs and significant delays. If we do not receive the necessary regulatory approvals, we will not be able to generate product revenues and will not become profitable. We may encounter significant delays in the regulatory process that could result in excessive costs that may prevent us from continuing to develop our product candidates. In addition, the failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may result in criminal prosecution, civil penalties, product recalls, withdrawal of product approval, mandatory restrictions or other actions that could impair our ability to conduct our business.\nThe development, manufacture and commercialization of biosimilar products in the United States poses unique risks, and our failure to successfully introduce biosimilar products in the United States could have a negative impact on our business and future operating results.\nWe intend to pursue market authorization for our biosimilar product candidates in numerous jurisdictions, including the United States. In the United States, an abbreviated pathway for approval of biosimilar products was established by the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, enacted on March 23, 2010, as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Subsequent to the enactment of the BPCIA, the FDA has released several final and draft guidance documents regarding implementation of the BPCIA regulatory pathway.\nThese guidance documents focus on scientific considerations, quality considerations and clinical pharmacology data related to demonstrating biosimilarity; meetings between the FDA and biosimilar product sponsors; requests for reference product exclusivity; naming conventions; common questions and answers regarding implementation of the BPCIA; and the standards for interchangeability.\nAlthough the FDA is still in the process of implementing the BPCIA, it approved the first biosimilar drug, Zarxio\u00ae, Sandoz\u2019s biosimilar version of Amgen\u2019s Neupogen\u00ae (filgrastim) for all of the reference product\u2019s approved indications on March 6, 2015.\nMoreover, market acceptance of biosimilar products in the United States is unclear. Numerous states are considering or have already enacted laws that regulate or restrict the substitution by state pharmacies of biosimilars for biological products already licensed by the FDA pursuant to biologic license applications, or \u201creference products.\u201d Market success of biosimilar products will depend on demonstrating to patients, physicians, payors, and relevant authorities that such products are safe and efficacious compared to other existing products.\nWe plan to continue to analyze and incorporate into our biosimilar development plans any final regulations issued by the FDA, pharmacy substitution policies enacted by state governments, and other applicable requirements established by relevant authorities. The costs of development and approval, along with the probability of success for our biosimilar product candidates, will be dependent upon application of any laws and regulations issued by the relevant regulatory authorities.\nBiosimilar products may also be subject to extensive patent clearances and patent infringement litigation, which will likely delay and could prevent the commercial launch of a product. Moreover, the BPCIA prohibits the FDA from accepting an application for a biosimilar candidate to a reference product within four years of the reference product\u2019s licensure by the FDA. In addition, the BPCIA provides innovative biologics with twelve years of exclusivity from the date of their licensure, during which time the FDA cannot approve any application for a biosimilar candidate to the reference product. However, in his proposed budget for fiscal year 2015, President Obama proposed to cut this twelve-year period of exclusivity down to seven years. He also proposed to prohibit additional periods of exclusivity due to minor changes in product formulations, a practice often referred to as \u201cevergreening.\u201d It is possible that Congress may take these or other measures to reduce or eliminate periods of exclusivity.\nIn July 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit interpreted the BPCIA as requiring biosimilar manufacturers to send a required pre-launch notice to the manufacturer of the reference biologic only after the FDA has approved the biosimilar for licensure. This ruling potentially provides the reference product manufacturer with an additional 180 days of marketing exclusivity for the innovator biologic, depending on whether the product\u2019s 12-year exclusivity has expired at the time that the pre-launch notice is received from the biosimilar manufacturer.\nThe BPCIA is complex and only beginning to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. As a result, its ultimate impact, implementation, and meaning is subject to significant uncertainty. Future implementation decisions by the FDA could result in delays in the development or commercialization of our product candidates or increased costs to assure regulatory compliance, and could adversely affect our operating results by restricting or significantly delaying our ability to market new biosimilar products in the United States.\nEven if we receive regulatory approvals for our product candidates, we will be subject to ongoing obligations and continued regulatory review, which may result in significant additional expense. If we fail to comply with continuing regulatory requirements, we could lose regulatory approvals, and our business would be adversely affected.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates, we will be subject to extensive and continued regulatory review regarding manufacturing, labeling, packaging, distribution, adverse event reporting, storage, import, export, advertising, promotion and recordkeeping, among other activities. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, manufacturing facility registration and inspection, as well as continued compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMPs and Good Clinical Practice, or GCPs for any clinical trials that we conduct post-approval. Any regulatory approvals that we receive for our product candidates may also be subject to limitations on the approved indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, or contain requirements for potentially costly post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of the product candidate. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with our third-party manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in, among other things:\n\uf0b7 restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, withdrawal of the product from the market, or voluntary or mandatory product recalls;\n\uf0b7 fines, warning letters or holds on clinical trials;\n\uf0b7 refusal by regulatory authorities to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;\n\uf0b7 product seizure or detention, recalls, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; and\n\uf0b7 injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nThe laws, regulations, and policies of the regulatory authorities may change and additional laws, regulations, and policies may be enacted or established that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained, which would adversely affect our business, prospects and ability to achieve or sustain profitability. See \u201cRisks Relating to our Reliance on Third Parties-We rely on third parties to conduct and oversee our clinical trials for our biosimilar product candidates, and expect to continue to do so as we progress the development of our pipeline product candidates. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, meet expected deadlines, or otherwise conduct the trials as required or comply with regulatory requirements, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates when expected or at all, and our business could be substantially harmed.\u201d\nIf we are not able to demonstrate biosimilarity of our biosimilar product candidates to the satisfaction of regulatory authorities, we will not obtain regulatory approval for commercial sale of our biosimilar product candidates and our future results of operations would be adversely affected.\nOur future results of operations depend, to a significant degree, on our ability to obtain regulatory approval for and to commercialize our proposed biosimilar products. To obtain regulatory approval for the commercial sale of these product candidates, we will be required to demonstrate to the satisfaction of regulatory authorities, among other things, that our proposed biosimilar products are highly similar to biological reference products already licensed by the regulatory authority pursuant to marketing applications, notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components, and that they have no clinically meaningful differences as compared to the marketed biological products in terms of the safety, purity and potency of the products. Each individual jurisdiction may apply different criteria to assess biosimilarity, based on a preponderance of the data that can be interpreted subjectively in some cases. In the European Union, the similar nature of a biosimilar and a reference product is demonstrated by comprehensive comparability studies covering quality, biological activity, safety and efficacy.\nIt is uncertain if regulatory authorities will grant the full originator label to biosimilar product candidates when they are approved. For example, Hospira\u2019s INFLECTRA\u2122, an infliximab biosimilar molecule, was approved in Europe for the full originator label but did not receive the full originator label when approved in Canada. A similar outcome could occur with respect to one or more of our product candidates.\nIn the event that regulatory authorities require us to conduct additional clinical trials or other lengthy processes, the commercialization of our proposed biosimilar products could be delayed or prevented. Delays in the commercialization of or the inability to obtain regulatory approval for these products could adversely affect our operating results by restricting or significantly delaying our introduction of new biosimilars.\nThe structure of complex proteins used in protein-based therapeutics is inherently variable and highly dependent on the processes and conditions used to manufacture them. If we are unable to develop manufacturing processes that achieve a requisite degree of biosimilarity to the originator drug, and within a range of variability considered acceptable by regulatory authorities, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for our products.\nProtein-based therapeutics are inherently heterogeneous and their structures are highly dependent on the production process and conditions. Products from one production facility can differ within an acceptable range from those produced in another facility. Similarly, physicochemical differences can also exist among different lots produced within a single facility. The physicochemical complexity and size of biologic therapeutics create significant technical and scientific challenges in the context of their replication as biosimilar products.\nThe inherent variability in protein structure from one production lot to another is a fundamental consideration with respect to establishing biosimilarity to an originator product to support regulatory approval requirements. For example, the glycosylation of the protein, meaning the manner in which sugar molecules are attached to the protein backbone of a therapeutic protein when it is produced in a living cell, is critical to half-life (how long the drug stays in the body), efficacy and even safety of the therapeutic and is therefore a key consideration for biosimilarity. Defining and understanding the variability of an originator molecule in order to match its glycosylation profile requires significant skill in cell biology, protein purification and analytical protein chemistry. Furthermore, manufacturing proteins with reliable and consistent glycosylation profiles at scale is challenging and highly dependent on the skill of the cell biologist and process scientist.\nThere are extraordinary technical challenges in developing complex protein-based therapeutics that not only must achieve an acceptable degree of similarity to the originator molecule in terms of characteristics such as the unique glycosylation pattern (attachment of sugars to the protein) critical to therapeutic efficacy, but also the ability to develop manufacturing processes that can replicate the necessary structural characteristics within an acceptable range of variability sufficient to satisfy regulatory authorities.\nGiven the challenges caused by the inherent variability in protein production, we may not be successful in developing our products if regulators conclude that we have not achieved a sufficient level of biosimilarity to the originator product, or that the processes we use to manufacture our products are unable to produce our products within an acceptable range of variability.\nRisks Relating to our Reliance on Third Parties\nWe rely on third parties to conduct and oversee our clinical trials for our biosimilar product candidates, and expect to continue to do so as we progress the development of our pipeline product candidates. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, meet expected deadlines, or otherwise conduct the trials as required or comply with regulatory requirements, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates when expected or at all, and our business could be substantially harmed.\nWe rely upon third-party CROs to monitor and manage the clinical sites and investigators for our ongoing clinical programs, and to audit and verify the data produced by these parties. We also rely upon medical institutions, clinical investigators and contract laboratories to conduct our trials in accordance with our clinical protocols and in accordance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. These third parties play a significant role in the conduct of these trials and the subsequent collection and analysis of data from the clinical trials. These third parties are not our employees, and except for remedies available to us under our agreements with such third parties, there is no guarantee that any such third party will devote adequate time and resources to our clinical trial. If any CROs engaged by us or any other third parties upon which we rely for administration and conduct of our clinical trials do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, if they need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols, regulatory requirements, or for other reasons, or if they otherwise perform in a substandard manner, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed, suspended or terminated, and we may not be able to complete development of, obtain regulatory approval for, or successfully commercialize our product candidates. We plan to rely heavily on these third parties for the execution of our planned global clinical program for BOW015 and for other clinical trials for products we are developing or may develop in the future, and will control only certain aspects of their activities. Nevertheless, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol, legal, regulatory and scientific standards, and our reliance on our CROs does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities.\nWe and any CROs that we engage are required to comply with GCP requirements, which are regulations and guidelines enforced by regulatory authorities around the world for products in clinical development. Regulatory authorities enforce these GCP regulations through periodic inspections of clinical trial sponsors, principal investigators and clinical trial sites. If we or any of our CROs fail to comply with applicable GCP regulations, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and our submission of marketing applications may be delayed or the regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. We cannot provide any assurance that, upon inspection, a regulatory authority will determine that any of our clinical trials comply or complied with applicable GCP regulations. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with product produced under cGMP regulations. Our failure to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process.\nClinical trials require a substantial number of patients that can allow statistically significant results. Delays in site initiation or unexpectedly low patient recruitment rates may delay the results of the clinical trial. CROs may also generate higher costs than anticipated. As a result, our results of operations and the commercial prospects for our product candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase, and our ability to generate revenue could be delayed. Further, if our relationship with any CRO that we engage to perform services on our behalf is terminated, we may be unable to enter into arrangements with an alternative CRO on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Switching or adding CROs can involve substantial cost and require extensive management time and focus. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new CRO commences work. As a result, delays may occur, which can materially impact our ability to meet our desired clinical development timelines. Though we carefully manage our relationships with our CROs, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter challenges or delays in the future or that these delays or challenges will not have a material adverse impact on our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe rely on third parties, and in some cases a single third party, to manufacture nonclinical and clinical supplies of our product candidates, to store critical components of our product candidates for us, and also to commercialize our product candidates. Our business could be harmed if those third parties fail to provide us with sufficient quantities of product candidates at acceptable quality levels and on commercially reasonable terms, or fail to commercialize our products in accordance with the terms of our agreements with them.\nWe do not have the infrastructure or capability internally to manufacture supplies of our biosimilar product candidates for use in the conduct of our nonclinical and clinical studies or on a commercial scale. We rely on third-party manufacturers, including our India-based contract manufacturer RLS, to manufacture and supply us with BOW015 in India. As discussed in the other risk factors described in this section, we may need to seek additional third-party manufacturers following RLS\u2019 completion of its manufacture obligations pursuant to the Settlement Agreement (as described below). In May 2015, we entered into a development and future distribution agreement with mAbxience, S.A., or Mabxience, a wholly owned subsidiary of CHEMO Group, for BOW015 in Latin American markets, including Argentina, Chile, Ecuador, Paraguay, Uruguay and Venezuela. We have an established partnership with Livzon for the production of biosimilars for China and associated markets. In July 2015, we also entered into an agreement with Swiss Pharma International AG, an affiliate of Pharmaceutical Works Polpharma S.A., or, together with Swiss Pharma International AG, Polpharma, for the development and commercialization of BOW015, BOW050 and BOW070 in certain designated territories, including most of the European Union, certain countries in the Middle East, Turkey, Russia, and other countries comprising the CIS. Further, we are currently party to an agreement with Sun, pursuant to which we granted to Sun exclusive rights under our intellectual property and regulatory materials relating to BOW015 to develop and commercialize BOW015 in India and certain other countries in Asia and North Africa. Pursuant to this agreement, Sun has agreed to distribute and sell BOW015 in India under the marketing authorization granted to RLS for BOW015. We also have an agreement with Fujifilm Diosynth Biotechnologies U.S.A., Inc. (\u201cFujifilm\u201d) for BOW015 process development with a view toward establishing Fujifilm as a source of future clinical and commercial supply of BOW015. Developing successful scale up techniques for manufacture of our biosimilar product candidates for commercial quantities will be time consuming and may not yield the quantities of product that we anticipate, which may have a material impact on our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates. Moreover, the market for contract manufacturing services for protein therapeutics is highly cyclical, with periods of relatively abundant capacity alternating with periods in which there is little available capacity. If any need we have for contract manufacturing services increases during a period of industry-wide production capacity constraints, we may not be able to produce our product candidates on a timely basis or on commercially viable terms. Although we generally do not begin a clinical\nstudy unless we believe we have a sufficient supply of a product candidate to complete such study, any significant delay or discontinuity in the supply of a product candidate for an ongoing clinical study due to the need to replace a third-party manufacturer could considerably delay completion of our clinical studies, product testing, and potential regulatory approval of our product candidates, which could harm our business and results of operations.\nAny failure or refusal to supply the components for product candidates that we may develop could delay, prevent or impair our clinical development or commercialization efforts. Although we endeavor, and will continue to do so in the future, to establish alternative sources of supply for BOW015 and our other product candidates in order to protect against any disruption in product supply, we cannot assure you that we will be able to find a suitable alternative manufacturer who is permitted to supply product under applicable regulatory laws, or to enter into appropriate agreements with such third parties on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If our contract manufacturers were to breach or terminate their manufacturing arrangements with us, the development or commercialization of the affected products or product candidates could be delayed, which could have an adverse effect on our business. Any change in our manufacturers could be costly because the commercial terms of any new arrangement could be less favorable and the expenses relating to the transfer of necessary technology and processes could be significant.\nIf any of our product candidates are approved for any given jurisdiction, in order to produce the quantities necessary to meet anticipated market demand, any contract manufacturer that we engage may need to increase manufacturing capacity. If we are unable to produce our product candidates in sufficient quantities to meet the requirements for the launch of these products or to meet future demand, our revenue and gross margins could be adversely affected. Although we believe that we will not have any material supply issues, we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain long-term supply arrangements for our product candidates or materials used to produce them on acceptable terms, if at all. If we are unable to arrange for third-party manufacturing, or to do so on commercially reasonable terms, we may not be able to complete development of our products or market them.\nWe also rely on third parties to store the BOW015 master and working cell bank, and those of our pipeline product candidates. We have one master cell bank and one working cell bank and believe we would have adequate backup should any cell bank be lost in a catastrophic event. However, it is possible that we could lose multiple cell banks and have our manufacturing severely impacted by the need to replace the cell banks, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we encounter delays or difficulties in executing our agreements with Mabxience, Polpharma or Sun to commercialize our product candidates in the various territories covered by our agreements, we may be required to seek alternative commercialization partners and/or develop a plan to commercialize our product candidates through direct sales into the various markets, either of which may adversely affect our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates. We have no direct sales experience in these territories. Therefore, if we decide to commercialize our product candidates through direct sales, we cannot assure you that we would be successful.\nDisputes under key agreements with third parties could adversely affect, delay or prevent development or commercialization of our product candidates.\nAny agreements we have or may enter into with third parties, such as collaboration, license, formulation supplier, manufacturing, testing, clinical research organization or clinical trial agreements, may give rise to disputes regarding the rights and obligations of the parties to such agreements. Disagreements may occur relating to the parties\u2019 rights and obligations under these agreements, such as the scope of development or commercialization rights, ownership or use of intellectual property, the approach to obtaining regulatory approvals or commercialization strategy. Any disputes or commercial conflicts could lead to the termination of these agreements, delay progress of our product development programs, compromise our ability to renew agreements or obtain future agreements, lead to the loss of suppliers of our products, harm our intellectual property rights or result in costly litigation.\nIn December 2014, RLS exercised its three-year termination for-convenience right with respect to our manufacturing and supply agreement with RLS, which we refer to as the RLS Agreement, which would have caused the RLS Agreement to terminate in December 2017. In addition, in March 2015, RLS initiated an arbitration proceeding under the RLS Agreement alleging that the RLS Agreement grants RLS exclusive global supply rights to BOW015, that\nthe terms of our collaboration agreements with Fujifilm and Livzon (described above) violate the RLS Agreement, and sought to terminate the RLS Agreement. On April 22, 2015, we entered into a Settlement Agreement with RLS. Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, on May 4, 2015, RLS withdrew the arbitration proceeding it initiated, and the parties have agreed to release each other from all causes of actions or claims, present and future, arising under the RLS Agreement. Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, the parties finalized the remaining BOW015 batch production schedule with RLS agreeing to manufacture 15 final batches of BOW015 on or before June 30, 2016 with our option to have RLS manufacture an additional 5 batches on or before December 31, 2016. In January 2016, we amended the Settlement Agreement to extend the time for RLS to manufacture the 15 final batches to June 30, 2017. RLS has also agreed to use reasonable commercial efforts to transfer the existing Indian marketing authorization for BOW015 granted by the DCGI to us or our designee, with all costs of the transfer to be borne by us and subject to the DCGI\u2019s approval of such transfer. We have agreed to pay to RLS a fee of $2.3 million, payable in four installments over the course of the final batch manufacture, with the final installment to be paid no later than ten days after June 30, 2016. Following the satisfaction by both parties of all of the terms of the Settlement Agreement, the RLS Agreement and related agreements between the parties shall be terminated and neither party shall have any further rights or obligations thereunder.\nWhile we believe that, based on forecasts from our Indian commercial partner, Sun, the current inventory, and future inventory as agreed to under the Settlement Agreement, of BOW015 is sufficient to fulfill anticipated demand there through the middle of 2018, it is possible that demand will increase in excess of our current inventory and that we will not be able to meet these demands if the agreed-upon batches to be manufactured by RLS pursuant to the Settlement Agreement are not sufficient to meet such increased needs. We intend to continue to build up additional BOW015 inventory via the agreed upon production runs by RLS, as necessary to establish sufficient product for the Indian territory, but we cannot be certain that this additional supply will be adequate. It is possible that RLS could stop providing us with BOW015 entirely, despite the terms of the Settlement Agreement and regardless of whether this causes RLS to breach the RLS Agreement or the Settlement Agreement. We and Sun intend to transfer BOW015 manufacturing for Indian territory to an alternate contract manufacturer, but there can be no assurances that we will be successful in making such a transfer on a timely basis, or at all. This, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our ability to manufacture or supply BOW015 for use in commercial sales in India and other markets currently contemplated to be served by Sun.\nWhere we apply our In Market, For Market strategy for commercialization of our product candidates in emerging markets, where approved, we expect to transfer our cell lines and certain proprietary manufacturing technology to our third-party partners in order to permit locally-based manufacture of our biosimilar products by our partners. If our alliances with these partners terminate, our business could be harmed if such former partners continue to use our technology in such countries following termination, in breach of our agreements with them.\nUnder our collaboration with Livzon, and under future In Market, For Market collaborations, we expect to transfer the manufacture and certain development and commercialization responsibilities for BOW015 and certain of our pipeline product candidates to Livzon and other future collaborators, along with certain of our SCALE manufacturing technology, and to provide technical assistance in such territories to assist our partners in establishing manufacturing capacity or modifying their existing manufacturing capacity for the production of our biosimilar product candidates. If our alliances with Livzon and any future partners are not successful, or our agreements with such partners are terminated, our agreements will include terms that require the partners to immediately cease any use of our technology, and to return to us any tangible embodiments of such technology, including our cell lines. However, our former partners may fail to comply with these terms, and may continue to use our technology to manufacture and sell biosimilar products in such countries, in breach of our agreements with them. In such case, we may be forced to enforce our contractual and intellectual property rights in the applicable countries, which would be time-consuming and costly, and would divert substantial management time and resources from other aspects of our business. Further, although we endeavor to include dispute resolution provisions in our agreements that we believe are fully enforceable irrespective of the jurisdiction, including by the use of arbitration, countries outside the United States where we have In Market, For Market collaborations may not provide the same level of protection for our contractual and intellectual property rights, and there is no guarantee that we would be successful in preventing a party to whom we have transferred our technology from continuing to use our cell lines and technology to manufacture biosimilar products, in which case our business in those countries could be adversely affected.\nIn certain countries where we expect to commercialize our product candidates, under applicable laws, it is necessary for us to rely on locally established third parties to act as the holder of marketing approvals or authorizations for our product candidates in such countries. Our business could be harmed if those third parties fail to comply with the terms of such marketing authorizations or approvals, or fail to act in accordance with our instructions in relation to the marketing and sale of our product candidates covered by such authorizations or approvals.\nIn some circumstances, it may be necessary as a matter of applicable local law, for the marketing and manufacturing approvals for our biosimilar products to be held by a third party that is not one of our affiliates. For example, our marketing approval in India for BOW015 is currently held in the name of our manufacturing partner, RLS, which also holds the manufacturing approval for BOW015. Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement described above, RLS has agreed to use reasonable commercial efforts to transfer such authorization to us or our designee, subject to approval by the DCGI. The marketing approval held by RLS for manufacture and sale of infliximab in India is based on and is specific to the data arising from our clinical trials conducted with respect to BOW015, which data is owned solely by us, and RLS therefore has no right to commercialize BOW015 in India or in any other country independently of us on the basis of such marketing authorization. We have a manufacturing and supply agreement in place with RLS that includes provisions that permit us to have oversight over RLS\u2019s activities in order to protect against breach by RLS of the terms of such marketing approval, and we will seek to include equivalent contractual protections in future agreements with third parties that hold regulatory approvals on our behalf. However, there is no guarantee that RLS or any other such third party will comply with the terms of the marketing authorization for the applicable biosimilars or with applicable laws. Where permissible under applicable laws, we also seek to provide for transfer of rights in any regulatory approval to an alternative holder on termination of our agreements with such third parties, and we also endeavor, and will continue to do so in the future, to establish alternative sources of supply for BOW015 and our future product candidates in order to protect against any disruption in product supply. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to find an alternative holder for any such regulatory approvals in a timely fashion, or to enter into appropriate agreements with such third parties on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Any non-compliance with applicable laws or the terms of regulatory approvals by such third parties could result in the permission to market and sell the applicable product candidate being revoked in one or more countries, which would materially jeopardize our right to commercialize BOW015 in India and such other countries.\nWe expect to partner with third parties in connection with the development of certain of our product candidates. Even if we enter into such collaborations, and we believe that the development of our technology and product candidates is promising, our partners may choose not to proceed with such development.\nOur agreements with potential partners may include the right for our partner to terminate the agreement on short notice upon the occurrence of certain circumstances. Accordingly, even if we enter into agreements with third-party partners in all of the territories where we intend to pursue commercialization of our product candidates, and we believe that the development of such product candidates are worth pursuing, our partners may choose not to continue with such development. If any of our partnerships are terminated, we may be required to devote additional resources to the development of our product candidates or seek a new partner on short notice, and the terms of any additional partnerships or other arrangements that we establish may not be favorable to us, if an alternative partner is even available.\nWe are also at risk that our partnerships or other arrangements may not be successful. Factors that may affect the success of our partnerships include the following:\n\uf0b7 our partners may incur financial and cash-flow difficulties that force them to limit or reduce their participation in our joint projects;\n\uf0b7 our partners may be pursuing alternative technologies or developing alternative products that are competitive to our technology and products, either on their own or in partnership with others;\n\uf0b7 our partners may terminate their partnerships with us, which could make it difficult for us to attract new partners or adversely affect perception of us in the business and financial communities; and\n\uf0b7 our partners may pursue higher priority programs or change the focus of their development programs, which could affect their commitment to us.\nWe have entered into agreements with Mabxience, for the development and future distribution of BOW015 in certain Latin American countries, Polpharma, for the development and commercialization of BOW015, BOW050 and BOW070 in certain European and Middle Eastern countries, and Livzon, for development and commercialization of BOW015, BOW070 and up to three other biosimilar pipeline products in China and related territories. If our collaborations are not successful or if we or our partners terminate our agreements, we may not be able to progress our plans to develop and commercialize our product candidates in the related territories. Although we believe that there are appropriate alternative partners in each territory, there is no guarantee that we could identify and negotiate satisfactory terms with any such alternative partner, or that we could do so in a timeframe that would not compromise our ability to commercialize our product candidates in a timely manner or at all.\nIf we cannot maintain successful partnerships, our business, financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected.\nInternational expansion of our business exposes us to business, regulatory, political, operational, financial, and economic risks associated with doing business outside of the United States.\nOur business strategy incorporates significant international expansion, with a primary focus on developed markets, such as Europe, as well as local production markets, such as China and Brazil and accessible markets such as India and Latin America. We plan to engage in manufacturing, maintain sales representatives and conduct clinical trials outside of the United States. Doing business internationally involves a number of risks, including but not limited to:\n\uf0b7 multiple, conflicting, and changing laws and regulations such as privacy regulations, tax laws, export and import restrictions, employment laws, intellectual property laws, regulatory requirements, and other governmental approvals, permits, and licenses;\n\uf0b7 foreign laws favoring businesses that are owned by nationals of those countries as opposed to foreign-owned businesses operating locally;\n\uf0b7 failure by us to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals for the use of our products in various countries;\n\uf0b7 additional potentially relevant third-party patent or other rights;\n\uf0b7 complexities and difficulties in obtaining protection and enforcing our intellectual property;\n\uf0b7 difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\uf0b7 limits in our ability to penetrate and compete in international markets;\n\uf0b7 financial risks, such as longer payment cycles, difficulty collecting accounts receivable, difficulty obtaining insurance coverage, the impact of local and regional financial crises on demand and payment for our products, and exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and controls;\n\uf0b7 natural disasters, political and economic instability, including wars, terrorism, and political unrest, outbreak of disease, boycotts, curtailment of trade, and other business restrictions;\n\uf0b7 certain expenses including, among others, expenses for travel, translation, and insurance; and\n\uf0b7 regulatory and compliance risks that relate to maintaining accurate information and control over sales and activities that may fall within the purview of the FCPA, its books and records provisions, or its anti-bribery provisions, OFAC restrictions, anti-money laundering laws, export control laws, customs laws, sanctions laws and other laws governing our operations.\nAny of these factors could significantly harm any future international expansion and operations and, consequently, could adversely affect our business prospects.\nOur business could be harmed as a result of the risks associated with our acquisitions.\nAs part of our business strategy, we may from time to time seek to acquire businesses or assets that provide us with additional intellectual property, product candidates, customer relationships or geographic coverage. We can provide no assurances that we will be able to find and identify desirable acquisition targets or that we will be successful in entering into a definitive agreement with any one target. In addition, even if we reach a definitive agreement with a target, there is no assurance that we will complete any future acquisition.\nAny acquisitions we undertake or have recently completed, including the acquisition of Bioceros Holding B.V. (\u201cBioceros\u201d), will likely be accompanied by business risks which may include, among other things:\n\u00b7\nthe effect of the acquisition on our financial and strategic position and reputation;\n\u00b7\nthe failure of an acquisition to result in expected benefits, which may include benefits relating to enhanced revenues, technology, human resources, costs savings, operating efficiencies, goodwill and other synergies;\n\u00b7\nthe difficulty, cost and management effort required to integrate the acquired businesses, including costs and delays in implementing common systems and procedures and costs and delays caused by communication difficulties;\n\u00b7\nthe assumption of certain known or unknown liabilities of the acquired business, including litigation-related liabilities;\n\u00b7\nthe reduction of our cash available for operations and other uses, the increase in amortization expense related to identifiable assets acquired, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt;\n\u00b7\na lack of experience in new markets, new business culture, products or technologies or an initial dependence on unfamiliar distribution partners;\n\u00b7\nthe possibility that we will pay more than the value we derive from the acquisition;\n\u00b7\nthe impairment of relationships with our customers, partners or suppliers or those of the acquired business; and\n\u00b7\nthe potential loss of key employees of the acquired business.\nThese factors could harm our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nIn addition to the risks commonly encountered in the acquisition of a business or assets as described above, we may also experience risks relating to the challenges and costs of closing a transaction. The risks described above may be exacerbated as a result of managing multiple acquisitions at once.\nIndustry Related Risks\nIf efforts by manufacturers of reference products to delay or limit the use of biosimilars are successful, our sales of biosimilar products may suffer.\nMany manufacturers of reference products have increasingly used legislative, regulatory and other means in attempts to delay regulatory approval of and competition from biosimilars. These efforts have included sponsoring legislation to prevent pharmacists from substituting biosimilars for prescribed reference products or to make such substitutions more difficult by establishing notification, recordkeeping, and/or other requirements, as well as seeking to prevent manufacturers of biosimilars from referencing the brands of the innovator products in biosimilar product labels and marketing materials. If these or other efforts to delay or block competition are successful, we may be unable to sell our biosimilar product candidates, which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability.\nForeign governments tend to impose strict price controls on pharmaceutical products, which may adversely affect our revenue, if any.\nIn some foreign countries, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control. This is likely also to apply to pricing of biosimilar products. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a product. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our product candidate to other available therapies. If reimbursement of our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe use and generate materials that may expose us to expensive and time-consuming legal claims.\nOur development programs involve the use of hazardous materials, chemicals, and biological materials. We are subject to foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, and disposal of materials and waste products. We believe that our safety procedures for handling these materials comply with the standards prescribed by laws and regulations. However, we may incur significant costs to comply with current or future environmental laws and regulations. In addition, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from hazardous materials. In the event of an accident, an injured party may seek to hold us liable for any damages that result. Any liability could exceed the limits or fall outside the coverage of our insurance, and we may not be able to maintain insurance on acceptable terms, if at all.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nWe may not be able to develop or commercialize our product candidates due to intellectual property rights held by third parties.\nAlthough we aim to launch our biosimilar product candidates in markets where there is no valid third party patent protection covering the reference biologic product, or in some cases where the fundamental patent protection for the reference product has expired, if a third party holds a patent to a formulation technology related to our planned formulation of a product candidate, we may not be able to develop or commercialize such product candidates without first obtaining a license to such patent, or waiting for such patent to expire. In addition, in the United States, under certain limited circumstances, patents known as \u201csubmarine\u201d patents may issue without the corresponding application being previously published. If such a submarine patent were to issue and cover aspects of any one or more of our product candidates, it is possible that such patents could affect our ability to commercialize the affected product candidate(s). Our business will be harmed if we are unable to use the optimal formulation of our product candidates, which may occur because the formulations or methods of use are covered by one or more third-party patents, and a license to such patents is unavailable or is only available on terms that are unacceptable to us. In the case of our biosimilar product candidates, this may prevent us from establishing the equivalence to the reference biologic product required to gain regulatory approval for sale of such biosimilar product within a time frame that would make the commercialization of the affected biosimilar product candidate commercially viable.\nWe may not have identified all the relevant patents covering our product candidates, or the scope or term of identified patents may differ from our assessment, which may affect our ability to commercialize our product candidates.\nAlthough we have conducted searches in commercially available patent databases directed to patents that would cover reference products in our pipeline, we may not have identified all of the relevant patents. Patent filings can be\ncomplicated and involve many progeny cases in different jurisdictions around the world. Patents and patent applications are published weekly and if the databases that we use are not up to date when the search is conducted, then we may not identify relevant patents that may cover our product patents. If we fail to identify relevant patent filings in the jurisdictions in which we plan to commercialize, or if we incorrectly interpret the claims or scope of coverage afforded by any patent identified in our searches in any jurisdiction, such that our product candidates in fact infringe such patents, then our ability to commercialize our products in the applicable countries could be prevented or delayed. Further, the patents covering the reference products may be subject to adjustments or extensions under applicable law that may prolong the life of such patents. While we strive to avoid litigation by launching our product candidates in markets where the reference product is no longer subject to patent protection, if we incorrectly assess the applicable term of the patent, or if such term is extended in any jurisdiction via an appeal or otherwise, our ability to commercialize in that such jurisdiction could be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, the value of our technology could be materially adversely affected and our business would be harmed.\nWe do not currently own any patents or have any patent filings with any patent offices in the world. We rely solely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect proprietary know-how that may not be patentable, processes for which patents may be difficult to obtain or enforce and any other elements of our product development processes that involve proprietary know-how, information or technology that is not covered by patents. This includes our rights in our proprietary SCALE technology, which is critical to the success of our In Market, For Market strategy for commercialization of our product candidates in emerging markets. Trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements may afford only limited protection and may not: prevent our competitors from duplicating our products; prevent our competitors from gaining access to our proprietary information and technology; or permit us to gain or maintain a competitive advantage.\nAs part of our efforts to protect our trade secrets and other confidential information, we require our employees, consultants, collaborators and advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of their relationships with us, and we include equivalent provisions in all of our material collaboration and license agreements. These agreements require that all confidential information developed by the individual or made known to the individual by us during the course of the individual\u2019s relationship with us be kept confidential and not be disclosed to third parties. These agreements, however, may not provide us with adequate protection against improper use or disclosure of confidential information, and/or these agreements may be breached. Adequate remedies may not exist in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information. A breach of confidentiality could significantly affect our competitive position. Also, third parties, including our competitors, may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and technologies or otherwise lawfully gain access to our trade secrets and other confidential information. In such a case, we would have no right to prevent such third parties from using such proprietary information or technologies to compete with us, which could harm our competitive position.\nIn addition, where we enter into In Market, For Market collaborations to develop and commercialize our product candidates in emerging markets, these collaborations are expected to involve the establishment in such countries of independent manufacturing capacity for the applicable product candidates. Establishing such manufacturing capacity is expected to involve certain technology transfer by us to our strategic partners, and the provision by us of technical assistance in connection with such transfer. If our agreements with our collaborators are terminated, although these agreements provide that our former partners have no further rights in the transferred technology, such third parties could use the technology and know-how they received from us to continue to develop and commercialize the applicable products, in breach of our agreements with them, and which would materially impact our revenues from commercialization of our product candidates. In such case, it may be necessary for us to become involved in litigation or arbitration to retain and defend our rights in such technology, and to prevent such commercialization. Any such proceedings, which would be likely to be conducted in a country outside the United States, would be costly and time consuming, and would divert significant management time and resources, with no guarantee of a successful outcome.\nIf our trademarks and trade names are not adequately protected, then we may not be able to build name recognition in our markets of interest and our business may be adversely affected.\nWe rely on trademark protection to protect our business and our products. Our registered or unregistered trademarks or trade names may be challenged, infringed, circumvented or declared generic or determined to be infringing on other marks. We may not be able to protect our rights to these trademarks and trade names, which we need to build brand name recognition by potential customers or partners in our markets of interest. Over the long term, if we are unable to establish name recognition based on our trademarks and trade names, then we may not be able to compete effectively and our business may be adversely affected.\nWe may be subject to damages resulting from claims that we or our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of our employees\u2019 former employers.\nSome of our employees, consultants, collaborators, and advisors were previously employed at other biotechnology companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although no claims against us are currently pending, we may be subject to claims that these individuals or we have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of our employees\u2019 former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management. If we fail in defending such claims, in addition to paying money damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. A loss of key personnel or their work product could hamper or prevent our ability to commercialize certain product candidates, which would adversely affect our commercial development efforts.\nWe are dependent on proprietary technology licensed from others. If we lose our licenses, we may not be able to continue developing our products.\nWe have obtained licenses that give us rights to third party intellectual property that is necessary or useful to our business. These license agreements covering our product candidates impose various royalty and other obligations on us. One or more of our licensors may allege that we have breached our license agreement with them, and accordingly seek to terminate our license. If we materially breach the obligations in our license agreements, the licensor typically has the right to terminate the license and we may not be able to market products that were covered by the license, which could adversely affect our competitive business position and harm our business prospects. In addition, any claims brought against us by our licensors could be costly and time-consuming and would divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations.\nWe may not be able to protect against third-party copying of our product candidates.\nWe may need to resort to litigation to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights, including any misappropriation of our trade secrets or know how. As noted above, we currently rely upon trade secrets to protect our product candidates. Our product candidates utilize the same formulations and ingredients as others used in the marketplace and, as such, may not be eligible for any patent protection. In addition, there may be third-party patents and patent applications directed to formulations, processes of manufacture or other processes that could cover our product candidates. If these third-party patent applications covering our product candidates are approved, our business, prospects and financial condition would be materially adversely affected.\nLitigation or third-party claims of intellectual property infringement could require substantial time and money to resolve. Unfavorable outcomes in these proceedings could limit our activities.\nOur commercial success will depend in part on not infringing or violating the intellectual property rights of others. The manufacture, use and sale of new biosimilars that are the subject of conflicting patent rights have been the subject of substantial litigation in the biosimilars industry. These lawsuits relate to the validity and infringement of patents or proprietary rights of third parties. We may have to defend against charges that we violated patents or proprietary rights of third parties. This is especially true in the case of generic products on which the patent covering the reference product is expiring, an area where infringement litigation is prevalent, and in the case of new reference products where a competitor has obtained patents for similar products. We cannot guarantee that our product candidates will be free from claims by third parties alleging that we have infringed their intellectual property rights. Our competitors, some of which have substantially greater resources than we do and have made substantial intellectual\nproperty investments in competing technologies, may have applied for or obtained, or may in the future apply for and obtain, patent rights and other intellectual property that will prevent, limit or otherwise interfere with our ability to make, use and sell our products. Third parties may assert that we are employing their proprietary technologies without authorization and they may resort to litigation to attempt to enforce their rights. We may not be aware of whether our products do or will infringe existing or future patents or the intellectual property rights of others. Third parties may have or obtain patents in the future and claim that the use of our technology or any of our product candidates infringes their patents. Any lawsuits resulting from allegations that the operation of our business infringes the intellectual property rights of third parties could subject us to significant liability for damages and invalidate our proprietary rights, even if the lawsuits lack merit. We may not be able to develop or commercialize product candidates because of patent protection others have. Our business will be harmed if we cannot obtain a necessary or desirable license, can obtain such a license only on terms we consider to be unattractive or unacceptable, or if we are unable to redesign our product candidates or processes to avoid actual or potential patent or other intellectual property infringement.\nOur efforts to register, protect and defend our intellectual property rights, whether we are successful or not, may require us to incur substantial costs, including the diversion of management and technical personnel. An unfavorable ruling in intellectual property litigation could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require us to cease developing, manufacturing or selling the affected products or using the affected processes, require us to license the disputed rights from third parties, or result in awards of substantial damages against us. In addition, intellectual property litigation, whether we are successful or not, can be very expensive and may require us to incur substantial costs, including the diversion of management and technical personnel. During the course of any litigation, there may be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions, and other interim proceedings or developments in the litigation. If securities analysts or investors regard these announcements as negative, the market price of our common stock may decline. Any potential intellectual property litigation also could force us to do one or more of the following:\n\u00b7\nstop making, selling or using products or technologies that allegedly infringe the asserted intellectual property;\n\u00b7\nlose the opportunity to license our technology to others or to collect royalty payments based upon successful protection and assertion of our intellectual property rights against others;\n\u00b7\npay substantial damages or royalties to the party whose intellectual property rights we may be found to be infringing;\n\u00b7\npay the attorney fees and costs of litigation to the party whose intellectual property rights we may be found to be infringing;\n\u00b7\nredesign or rename, in the case of trademark claims, those products that contain the allegedly infringing intellectual property, which could be costly, disruptive and/or infeasible; or\n\u00b7\nattempt to obtain a license to the relevant intellectual property from third parties, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all.\nIf we fail to obtain any required licenses or make any necessary changes to our products or technologies, we may have to withdraw existing products from the market or may be unable to commercialize one or more of our products, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. There can be no assurance that we would prevail in any intellectual property infringement action, will be able to obtain a license to any third-party intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, successfully develop non-infringing alternatives on a timely basis, or license non-infringing alternatives, if any exist, on commercially reasonable terms. Any significant intellectual property impediment to our ability to develop and commercialize our products could seriously harm our business and prospects.\nRisks Related to an Investment in Our Common Stock\nOur management and independent auditors have identified material weaknesses in our internal controls, and we may be unable to develop, implement and maintain appropriate internal and disclosure controls in future periods, which may lead to errors or omissions in our financial statements.\nAs of December 31, 2015, there were material weaknesses in our controls over our financial statement close process and the financial reporting processes related to business combinations, income taxes and accrued development costs.\nThese material weaknesses have not been fully remediated. Prior to the complete remediation of these material weaknesses, there remains risk that the transitional controls on which we currently rely will fail to be sufficiently effective, which could result in a material misstatement of our financial position or results of operations and require a restatement of our financial statements.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated our internal controls and procedures, including the existence of the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, and concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC\u2019s rules and forms, or that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. We are currently designing and implementing new procedures and controls intended to address the material weaknesses described above. While this design and implementation phase is underway, we are relying significantly on outside accounting professionals until permanent employees can be hired to fill these roles and on manual procedures to assist us with meeting the objectives otherwise fulfilled by an effective control environment. The implementation of new procedures and controls could be costly and distract management from other activities.\nWe note that a system of procedures and controls, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all systems of procedures and controls, no evaluation can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, including instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, procedures and controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override. The design of any system of procedures and controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, our systems of procedures and controls, as we further develop and enhance them, may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective system of procedures and controls, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected and could be material and require a restatement of our financial statements.\nFollowing the expiration of the SEC waiver granted to us in connection with the Merger, we are now required to make a formal assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, beginning with this annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2015. If we are unable to establish appropriate internal controls, we may not have adequate, accurate or timely financial information, and we may be unable to meet our reporting obligations or comply with the requirements of the SEC or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which could result in the imposition of sanctions, including the inability of registered broker dealers to make a market in our common shares, or investigation by regulatory authorities. Any such action or other negative results caused by our inability to meet our reporting requirements or comply with legal and regulatory requirements or by disclosure of an accounting, reporting or control issue could adversely affect the trading price of our securities. Further and continued determinations that there are significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the effectiveness of our internal controls could also reduce our ability to obtain financing or could increase the cost of any financing we obtain and require additional expenditures to comply with applicable requirements.\nOur failure to meet the continued listing requirements of The NASDAQ Capital Market could result in a delisting of our common stock.\nIn connection with the Merger, we effected a reverse split of our common stock to enable us to comply with The NASDAQ Capital Market\u2019s minimum bid price listing requirement. Notwithstanding the reverse stock split and\ncompliance with The NASDAQ Capital Market\u2019s minimum bid price listing requirement, we may not be able to maintain a price per share of our common stock in excess of $1.00 per share or the additional criteria for continued listing of our common stock set forth by The NASDAQ Capital Market. The occurrence of any future non-compliance with The NASDAQ Capital Market\u2019s minimum bid price or other listing requirements may have a material adverse effect on our stock price, our business and our prospects.\nOur stock price is expected to continue to be volatile and you may not be able to resell your shares.\nWe cannot assure you that an active trading market for shares of our common stock will develop or be sustained. If an active market for our common stock does not develop, or is not sustained, it may be difficult to sell shares without depressing the market price for the shares or to sell your shares at all.\nThe market price for our common stock has been volatile, and market prices for securities of companies comparable to us have been highly volatile. In addition, the stock market as a whole and biotechnology and other life science stocks in particular have experienced significant price volatility. Like our common stock, these stocks have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of the individual companies. Factors giving rise to this volatility may include:\n\uf0b7 regulatory and other developments in both the United States and abroad;\n\uf0b7 developments concerning proprietary rights, including patents and litigation matters;\n\uf0b7 disclosure of new collaborations or other strategic transactions;\n\uf0b7 public concern about the safety or efficacy of our product candidates or technology, their components, or related technology or new technologies generally;\n\uf0b7 public announcements by our competitors or others regarding new products or new product candidates;\n\uf0b7 general market conditions and comments by securities analysts and investors; and\n\uf0b7 developments relating to our key partners.\nIn the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against companies that experience volatility in the market price of their securities. Whether or not meritorious, litigation brought against us could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nFluctuations in our operating losses could adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nOur operating losses may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis. Some of the factors that may cause our operating losses to fluctuate on a period-to-period basis include the status of our clinical and pre-clinical development programs, level of expenses incurred in connection with our clinical and pre-clinical development programs, restructuring costs, implementation or termination of collaboration, licensing, manufacturing or other material agreements with third parties, non-recurring revenue or expenses under any such agreement, and compliance with regulatory requirements. Period-to-period comparisons of our historical and future financial results may not be meaningful, and investors should not rely on them as an indication of future performance. Our fluctuating losses may fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors. Our failure to meet these expectations may cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and provisions of Delaware law may make an acquisition more difficult and could result in the entrenchment of management.\nWe are incorporated in Delaware. Anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law and our charter documents may make a change in control or efforts to remove management more difficult. Also, under Delaware law, our board of directors may adopt additional anti-takeover measures. The existence of the following provisions of Delaware law and our sixth amended and restated charter, as amended, or our amended and restated bylaws could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.\nOur charter authorizes our board of directors to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the terms of those shares of stock without any further action by our stockholders. If the board of directors exercises this power to issue preferred stock, it could be more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock and vote the stock they acquire to remove management or directors.\nOur charter also provides staggered terms for the members of our board of directors. Under Section 141 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, or the DGCL, and our charter, our directors may be removed by stockholders only for cause and only by vote of the holders of 75% of voting shares then outstanding. These provisions may prevent stockholders from replacing the entire board in a single proxy contest, making it more difficult for a third party to acquire control without the consent of our board of directors. These provisions could also delay the removal of management by the board of directors with or without cause. In addition, our amended and restated bylaws limit the ability our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders.\nOur equity incentive plans generally permit our board of directors to provide for acceleration of vesting of options granted under these plans in the event of certain transactions that result in a change of control. If our board of directors uses its authority to accelerate vesting of options, this action could make an acquisition more costly, and it could prevent an acquisition from going forward.\nUnder Section 203 of the DGCL, a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock until the holder has held the stock for three years unless, among other possibilities, the board of directors approves the transaction in advance. These provisions may have the effect of entrenching our management team and may deprive you of the opportunity to sell your shares to potential acquirers at a premium over prevailing prices. The potential inability to obtain a control premium could reduce the price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 90968, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "EPRSQ"}
