RISK FACTORS\nForward Looking Statements\nWe, or our representatives, occasionally may make or may have made certain forward-looking statements, either orally or in writing, including without limitation statements made or to be made in this Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, information in other filings with the SEC, press releases and other public documents or statements. In addition, our representatives, occasionally, participate in speeches and calls with market analysts, conferences with investors or potential investors in our securities and other meetings and conferences. Some of the information presented at these speeches, calls, meetings and conferences may include forward-looking statements. We use words like \u201cplan,\u201d \u201cestimate,\u201d \u201cexpect,\u201d \u201canticipate,\u201d \u201cbelieve,\u201d \u201cintend,\u201d \u201cgoal,\u201d \u201cseek,\u201d \u201cproject,\u201d \u201cstrategy,\u201d \u201cfuture,\u201d \u201clikely,\u201d \u201cmay,\u201d \u201cshould,\u201d \u201cwill\u201d and similar references to future periods to identify forward-looking statements.\nWe wish to ensure that all forward-looking statements are accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements, to ensure to the fullest extent possible the protections of the safe harbor established in the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Accordingly, all forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to, and are accompanied by, this discussion of certain important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in these forward-looking\nstatements. We caution the reader that this list of important factors may not be exhaustive. We operate in a rapidly changing business, and new risk factors emerge from time to time.\nForward-looking statements are neither historical facts nor assurances of future performance. Instead, they are based only on our current beliefs, expectations, and assumptions regarding the future of our business, future plans and strategies, projections, anticipated events and trends, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our control. We cannot predict every risk factor, nor can we assess the effect, if any, of all such risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. Accordingly, forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as a prediction of actual results. Further, we undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements that may be made occasionally, whether because of new information, future developments or otherwise, after the date they are made to conform the statements to actual results or changes in our expectations.\nFor more information about our results of operations and financial condition, see the discussion under Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d appearing later in this Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to our Pending Merger with CenturyLink\nOur pending merger with CenturyLink may cause disruption to our business.\nOn October 31, 2016, we entered into an agreement and plan of merger with CenturyLink, pursuant to which we will, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the stated closing conditions, merge with a wholly owned subsidiary of CenturyLink in a stock-and-cash transaction. The merger agreement generally requires us to operate our business in the ordinary course pending consummation of the proposed merger and restricts us, without CenturyLink\u2019s consent, from taking certain specified actions until the merger is completed. These restrictions may affect our ability to execute our business strategies and attain our financial and other goals and may affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The pursuit of the merger and the preparation for the integration of our business with CenturyLink\u2019s business may place a significant burden on management and internal resources. The diversion of management\u2019s attention away from day-to-day business concerns could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe are also subject to litigation related to the CenturyLink merger, which may result in significant costs and expenses. In addition to potential litigation-related expenses, we have incurred and will continue to incur other significant costs, expenses and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the CenturyLink merger, and many of these fees and costs are payable regardless of whether or not the CenturyLink merger is consummated.\nUncertainty regarding the completion of the CenturyLink merger may cause customers to delay or defer decisions concerning us and may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key employees.\nThe CenturyLink merger will be consummated only if stated conditions are met, including, among others, the approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement and approval of the merger by our stockholders, the approval of CenturyLink\u2019s proposed stock issuance in connection with the CenturyLink merger by CenturyLink\u2019s shareholders and the receipt of regulatory approvals. Many of the conditions are beyond our control. As a result, there may be uncertainty regarding the completion of the CenturyLink merger. This uncertainty, along with potential customer uncertainty regarding the service to be provided by the combined company following the CenturyLink merger, may cause customers to delay or defer decisions concerning purchases from us or affect our customer retention initiatives, which could\nnegatively affect our revenue, earnings and cash flow, regardless of whether the CenturyLink merger is ultimately completed.\nUncertainty regarding the completion of the CenturyLink merger may also foster uncertainty among employees about their future roles. Key employees may depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or desire not to remain with the combined company following the combination. This may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key management, sales, marketing, operational and technical personnel, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to generate revenue at anticipated levels prior to the completion of the CenturyLink merger.\nOur pending merger with CenturyLink is subject to conditions, including certain conditions that may not be satisfied, and may not be completed on a timely basis, or at all. Failure to complete the CenturyLink merger and the transactions contemplated thereby could have material and adverse effects on us.\nThe completion of our pending merger with CenturyLink is subject to a number of conditions, including the receipt of required regulatory approvals, the approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement and the approval of the CenturyLink merger by our stockholders, and the approval of CenturyLink\u2019s stock issuance in connection with the CenturyLink merger by CenturyLink\u2019s shareholders, which make the completion and timing of the completion of the CenturyLink merger uncertain. Also, either we or CenturyLink may terminate the Merger Agreement if the CenturyLink merger has not been completed by October 31, 2017 (subject to extension to January 31, 2018 under certain circumstances) unless the failure of the CenturyLink merger to be completed has resulted from the failure of the party seeking to terminate the Merger Agreement to perform its obligations.\nIf the CenturyLink merger is not completed on a timely basis, or at all, our ongoing business may be adversely affected. Additionally, in the event the CenturyLink merger is not completed, we will be subject to a number of risks without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the CenturyLink merger, including the following:\n\u2022\nWe may be required to pay to CenturyLink a termination fee of $737.5 million (less any previously reimbursed expenses), and in some cases, expenses of CenturyLink up to $75 million if the CenturyLink merger is terminated under qualifying circumstances, as described in the Merger Agreement;\n\u2022\nWe will be required, subject to certain exceptions, to pay our costs relating to the CenturyLink merger, such as financial advisor, legal, accounting and printing fees, whether or not the CenturyLink merger is completed;\n\u2022\nTime and resources committed by management to matters relating to the CenturyLink merger (including integration planning) could otherwise have been devoted to pursuing other beneficial opportunities;\n\u2022\nThe market price of our common stock could decline to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the CenturyLink merger will be completed; and\n\u2022\nIf the Merger Agreement is terminated and our Board of Directors subsequently seeks another business combination, our stockholders cannot be certain that we will be able to find a party willing to enter into a merger agreement on terms equivalent to or more attractive than the terms that CenturyLink has agreed to in the CenturyLink merger.\nThe merger agreement contains provisions that could discourage a potential competing acquirer.\nThe merger agreement contains \u201cno shop\u201d provisions that, subject to limited exceptions, restrict our ability to solicit, initiate, or knowingly encourage and facilitate competing third-party proposals for the acquisition of our stock or assets. In addition, before our board of directors withdraws, qualifies or modifies its recommendation of the proposed merger with CenturyLink or terminates the merger agreement to enter into a third-party acquisition proposal, CenturyLink generally has an opportunity to offer to modify the terms of the proposed merger. In some circumstances, upon termination of the merger agreement, we will be required to pay a termination fee of $737.5 million. These provisions could discourage a potential third-party acquirer that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant portion of us from considering or proposing that acquisition, even if it were prepared to pay consideration with a higher per share cash or market value than the market value proposed to be received or realized in the merger, or might otherwise result in a potential third-party acquirer proposing to pay a lower price to our stockholders than it might otherwise have proposed to pay because of the added expense of the termination fee that may become payable in certain circumstances.\nRisks Related to our Business Operations\nWe need to increase Core Network Services revenue from the services we offer to realize our targets for financial and operating performance.\nWe must increase Core Network Services revenue at acceptable margins to realize our targets for financial and operating performance, including free cash flow. If:\n\u2022\nwe do not avoid excessive customer churn or improve our current relationships with existing key customers;\n\u2022\nwe cannot expand the available capacity on our network to meet our customers\u2019 demands promptly; or\n\u2022\nour customers determine to obtain these services from either their own network or from one of our competitors,\nwe may not increase or maintain either or both of our Core Network Services revenue at acceptable margins and free cash flow, which would adversely affect our ability to become and/or remain profitable.\nOur business requires the continued development of effective business support systems and uniform standards, controls and policies to implement customer orders and to provide and bill for services.\nOur business depends on our ability to continue to develop and manage effective business support systems. In certain cases, developing these business support systems is required to realize anticipated benefits from both past and future acquisitions. The development and management of business support systems is a complicated undertaking requiring significant resources and expertise, developing uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies and the efficient consolidation and elimination of business support systems that are no longer useful in the business. This undertaking also requires support from third-party vendors. Following the development of the business support systems, the data migration regarding network and circuit inventory must be completed for the full benefit of the systems to be realized. Business support systems are needed for:\n\u2022\nquoting, accepting and inputting customer orders for services;\n\u2022\nprovisioning, installing and delivering services;\n\u2022\nproviding customers with direct access to our information systems so they can manage the services they purchase from us, generally through web-based customer portals; and\n\u2022\nbilling for services.\nBecause our business provides for continued rapid growth in the number of customers we serve, the volume of services offered and the integration of any acquired companies\u2019 business support systems, there is a need to continually develop our business support systems on a schedule sufficient to meet proposed milestone dates. Failing to continue to develop effective unified business support systems or complete the data migration regarding network and circuit inventory into these systems could materially adversely affect our ability to implement our business plans and realize anticipated benefits from our acquisitions.\nWe may lose customers if we experience system failures that significantly disrupt the availability and quality of the services we provide. System failures may also cause interruptions to service delivery and the completion of other corporate functions.\nOur operations depend on our ability to limit and mitigate interruptions or degradation in service for customers. Interruptions in service or performance problems for whatever reason, including integration related activities, could undermine confidence in our services and cause us to lose customers or make it more difficult to attract new ones. In addition, because many of our services are critical to the businesses of many of our customers, any significant interruption or degradation in service could cause lost profits or other losses to customers. Although we generally limit our liability for service failures in our service agreements to limited service credits (generally in the form of free service for a short period of time) and generally exclude any liability for \u201cconsequential\u201d damages such as lost profits, a court might not enforce these limitations on liability in the manner contemplated, which could expose us to financial loss. In addition, we often provide our customers with committed service levels. If we cannot meet these service level commitments, we may have to provide service credits or other compensation to our customers. Because we offer emergency notification services called \u201c911\u201d services, any significant interruption or degradation in those services could create legal and financial exposure.\nThe failure of any equipment or facility on our network, including our network operations control centers and network data storage locations, could cause the interruption of customer service and other corporate functions until necessary repairs are effected or replacement equipment is installed. In addition, our business continuity plans may not be adequate to address a particular failure we experience. Delays, errors, network equipment or network facility failures, including with respect to our network operations control centers and network data storage locations, could also result from natural disasters (including natural disasters that may increase in frequency because of the effects of climate change), disease, accidents, terrorist acts, power losses, security breaches, vandalism or other illegal acts, computer viruses, or other causes. Our business could be significantly hurt from these delays, errors, failures or faults including as a result of:\n\u2022\nservice interruptions;\n\u2022\nexposure to customer liability;\n\u2022\nthe inability to install new service;\n\u2022\nthe unavailability of employees necessary to provide services;\n\u2022\nthe delay in completing other corporate functions such as issuing bills and preparing financial statements; or\n\u2022\nthe need for expensive modifications to our systems and infrastructure.\nWe have only recently generated net income for our three most recent full fiscal years and have generated substantial net losses in the past.\nWhile we had net income of $677 million and $3.433 billion (which included a $3.3 billion income tax benefit due to the release of a valuation allowance against U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets) and $314 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, we generated net losses of approximately $109 million and $422 million for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Although we anticipate that our operating results will continue to improve over time, there can be no assurance that the recent level of operating results and profitability will continue and that anticipated future operating improvements will be realized on schedule or that we can sustain profitability in the future. If we would incur net losses in the future they could limit our ability to fund expansions of our network, investments in our products and services, interest and principal payments on our debt, or other business needs.\nIf our security measures are breached, or if our services are subject to attacks that degrade or deny the ability of users to access our systems, products and services, we may experience significant legal and financial exposure, our products and services may be perceived as not being secure, users and customers may curtail or stop using our products and services, and our business may be disrupted.\nNetwork and information systems and other technologies are critical to our business activities. Network and information systems-related events such as computer hackings, cyber-attacks, computer viruses, worms or other destructive or disruptive software, process breakdowns, denial of service attacks or other malicious activities, or any combination of the these items, could cause a degradation or disruption of our services, damage to our properties, equipment and data, or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. We experience cyber-attacks against our network and information systems of varying degrees regularly, and as a result, unauthorized parties could obtain access to our data or our customers\u2019 data. Our security measures may also be breached due to employee error, malfeasance, or otherwise. And outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce our employees or customers to disclose sensitive information to gain access to our data or our customers\u2019 data, including information subject to data protection laws and regulations both in the United States and elsewhere governing personally identifiable information, protected health information and Customer Proprietary Network Information. The risk of these systems-related events and security breaches occurring has intensified, in part because we maintain certain information necessary to conduct our businesses in digital form stored on servers connected to the Internet.\nWhile we develop and maintain systems and processes designed to prevent systems-related events and security breaches from occurring, the development and maintenance of these systems and processes is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. Despite our efforts, there can be no assurance that unauthorized access and security breaches will not occur in the future. In addition, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may not anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures.\nAny security breach or unauthorized access could cause significant legal and financial exposure, including regarding customer credits, lost revenue due to business interruption, increased expenditures on security measures, monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions, fines and/or criminal\nprosecution. In addition, damage to our reputation and the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could cause us to lose customers. Moreover, the amount and scope of insurance we maintain against losses resulting from unauthorized access or security breaches may not be sufficient to cover our losses or otherwise adequately compensate us for any disruptions to our businesses that may result.\nFailure to develop and introduce new services could affect our ability to compete in the industry.\nWe continuously develop, test and introduce new services delivered over our communications network. These new services are intended to allow us to address new segments of the communications marketplace, address the changing communications needs of our existing customers and compete for additional customers.\nIn certain instances, introducing new services requires the successful development of new technology. If upgrades of existing technology are required for introducing new services, the success of these upgrades may depend on reaching mutually acceptable terms with vendors and on vendors meeting their obligations promptly.\nIn addition, new service offerings may not be widely accepted by our customers. If our new service offerings are not widely accepted by our customers, we may terminate those service offerings and we may be required to impair any assets or technology used to develop or offer those services.\nIf we cannot complete the development and introduction of new services promptly, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nOur future results will suffer if we do not effectively manage expansions to our operations.\nWe may continue to expand our operations through new product and service offerings and through additional strategic investments, acquisitions or joint ventures, some of which may involve complex technical and operational challenges. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to manage our expansion opportunities, which pose numerous risks and uncertainties, including the need to integrate new operations into our existing business in an efficient and timely manner, to combine accounting and data processing systems and management controls and to integrate relationships with customers, vendors and business partners. In addition, future acquisitions or joint ventures may involve the issuance of additional shares of our common stock, which may dilute our stockholders\u2019 ownership.\nAny future acquisitions of businesses or facilities could entail several risks, including:\n\u2022\nproblems with effectively integrating operations;\n\u2022\ninability to maintain key pre-acquisition business relationships;\n\u2022\nincreased operating costs;\n\u2022\nexposure to unanticipated liabilities; and\n\u2022\ndifficulties in realizing projected efficiencies, synergies and cost savings.\nWe continually evaluate potential investments and strategic opportunities to expand, enhance connectivity and add traffic to our network. In the future, we may seek additional investments, strategic alliances or similar arrangements, which may expose us to risks such as:\n\u2022\nthe difficulty of identifying appropriate investments, strategic allies or opportunities on terms acceptable to us;\n\u2022\nthe possibility that senior management may have to spend considerable time negotiating agreements and monitoring these arrangements;\n\u2022\npotential regulatory issues applicable to the telecommunications industry;\n\u2022\nthe loss or reduction in value of the capital investment;\n\u2022\nour inability to capitalize on the opportunities presented by these arrangements; and\n\u2022\nthe possibility of insolvency of a strategic ally.\nWe cannot be certain that our future expansion or acquisition opportunities will succeed, or that we will realize expected operating efficiencies, cost savings, revenue enhancements, synergies or other benefits.\nOur future growth depends upon the continued development and expansion of the Internet as a communications medium and marketplace for the distribution and consumption of data and video by businesses, consumers and governments.\nAchieving the anticipated benefits of our business operations will depend in part upon the continued development and expansion of the Internet as a communications medium and marketplace for the distribution and consumption of data and video by businesses, consumers and governments. Using the Internet for these purposes may not grow and expand at the rate we anticipate or may be restricted by such things as:\n\u2022\nactions by ISPs or the owners of access networks that restrict us from delivering our customers\u2019 traffic to the users of those networks;\n\u2022\nfuture regulation;\n\u2022\na lack of anticipated technology innovation and adoption; or\n\u2022\na lack of continued broadband penetration both in the United States and elsewhere.\nIntellectual property and proprietary rights of others could prevent us from using necessary technology to provide our services or subject us to expensive intellectual property litigation.\nIf technology necessary for us to provide our services was determined by a court to infringe a patent held by another entity that is unwilling to grant us a license on terms acceptable to us, we could be precluded by a court order from using that technology and we would likely be required to pay a significant monetary damages award to the patent holder. The successful enforcement of these patents, or our inability to negotiate a license for these patents on acceptable terms, could force us to cease using the relevant technology and offering services incorporating the technology. If a claim of infringement was brought against us based on the use of our technology or against our customers based on their use of our services for which we must indemnify, we could be subject to litigation to determine whether such use or sale is, in fact, infringing. This litigation could be expensive and distracting, regardless of the outcome.\nWhile our own patent portfolio may deter other operating companies from bringing such actions, patent infringement claims are increasingly being asserted by patent holding companies, which do not use technology and whose sole business is to enforce patents against operators, such as us, for\nmonetary gain. Because such patent holding companies do not provide services or use technology, the assertion of our own patents by way of counterclaim would be largely ineffective. We have already been the subject of time-consuming and expensive patent litigation brought by certain patent holding companies and we can reasonably expect that we will face further claims in the future.\nContinued uncertainty in the global financial markets and the global economy may negatively affect our financial results.\nContinued uncertainty in the global financial markets and economy may negatively affect our financial results. A prolonged period of economic decline could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and exacerbate some of the other risk factors we describe herein. Our operating results and financial condition could be negatively affected if, because of economic conditions:\n\u2022\ncustomers cancel, defer or forgo purchases of our services;\n\u2022\ncustomers cannot make timely payments to us;\n\u2022\nthe demand for, and prices of, our services are reduced because of actions by our competitors or otherwise;\n\u2022\nkey suppliers upon which we rely are unwilling or unable to provide us with the materials we need for our network on a timely basis or on terms we find acceptable; or\n\u2022\nour financial counterparties, insurance providers or other contractual counterparties cannot, or do not meet, their contractual commitments to us.\nFuture expansion or adaptation of our network will require substantial resources, which may not be available at the time.\nWe will need to continue to expand and adapt our network to remain competitive, which may require significant additional funding. Additional expansion and adaptations of our communications network\u2019s electronic and software components will be necessary to respond to:\n\u2022\ngrowing number of customers;\n\u2022\nthe development and launching of new services;\n\u2022\nincreased demands by customers to transmit larger amounts of data;\n\u2022\nchanges in customers\u2019 service requirements;\n\u2022\ntechnological advances by competitors; and\n\u2022\ngovernmental regulations.\nFuture expansion or adaptation of our network will require substantial additional financial, operational and managerial resources, which may not be available at the time. We may be unable to expand or adapt our network to respond to these developments on a timely basis and at a commercially reasonable cost.\nThe market prices for many of our services have decreased in the past and may decrease in the future, resulting in lower revenue and margins than we anticipate.\nOver the past few years, the market prices for many of our services have decreased. These decreases resulted from downward market pressure and other factors including:\n\u2022\ntechnological changes and network expansions which have resulted in increased transmission capacity available for sale by us and by our competitors;\n\u2022\nsome of our customer agreements contain volume based pricing; and\n\u2022\nsome of our competitors have been willing to accept smaller operating margins in the short term in an attempt to increase long-term revenue.\nTo retain customers and revenue, we often must reduce prices in response to market conditions and trends. As our prices for some of our services decrease, our operating results may suffer unless we can either reduce our operating expenses or increase traffic volume from which we can derive additional revenue.\nThe need to obtain additional capacity for our network from other providers increases our costs. In addition, the need to interconnect our network to networks controlled by others could increase our costs.\nWe use network resources owned by other companies for portions of our network. We obtain the right to use such network portions, including both telecommunications capacity and rights to use dark fiber, through operating leases and IRU agreements. In several of those agreements, the counter party is responsible for network maintenance and repair. If a counter party to a lease or IRU suffers financial distress or bankruptcy, we may not be able to enforce our rights to use these network assets or, even if we could continue to use these network assets, we could incur material expenses related to maintenance and repair. We could also incur material expenses if we had to locate alternative network assets. We may not succeed in obtaining reasonable alternative network assets if needed. Failure to obtain usage of alternative network assets, if necessary, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to carry on business operations. In addition, some of our agreements with other providers require the payment of amounts for services whether or not those services are used.\nIn the normal course of business, we must enter into interconnection agreements, including IP interconnection for voice and data services, with many domestic and foreign local telephone companies and the owners of networks that our customers desire to access to deliver their services. We are not always able to secure these interconnection agreements on favorable terms.\nCosts of obtaining service from other communications carriers comprise a significant proportion of the operating expenses of long distance carriers. Similarly, a large proportion of the costs of providing international service consists of payments to other carriers. Changes in regulation, particularly the regulation of local and international telecommunication carriers and local access network owners, could indirectly, but significantly, affect our competitive position. These changes could increase or decrease the costs of providing our services.\nOur operations are subject to regulation in each country in which we operate and require us to obtain and maintain several governmental licenses and permits. If we violate those regulatory requirements or to obtain and maintain those licenses and permits, including payment of related fees, if any, we may not be able to conduct our business in that jurisdiction. Moreover, those regulatory requirements could change in a manner that significantly increases our costs or otherwise adversely affects our operations.\nIn the ordinary course of constructing our networks and providing our services, we must obtain and maintain a variety of telecommunications and other licenses and authorizations in the countries in which we operate, and rights-of-way from utilities, railroads, incumbent carriers and other persons. We also must comply with a variety of regulatory obligations. Due to the political and economic risks associated with the countries in which we operate, there can be no assurance we can maintain our licenses or that they will be renewed upon their expiration. Our failure to obtain or maintain necessary licenses, authorizations and rights-of-way, or to comply with the obligations imposed upon license holders including the payment of fees, in one or more countries, may cause sanctions or additional costs, including the revocation of authority to provide services in one or more countries.\nIn addition, our subsidiaries are defendants in several lawsuits that, among other things, challenge the subsidiaries\u2019 use of rights-of-way. The plaintiffs have sought to have these lawsuits certified as class actions. It is possible that additional suits challenging use of our rights-of-way will be filed and those plaintiffs also may seek class certification. The outcome of such litigation may increase our costs and adversely affect our operating results.\nOur operations around the world are subject to regulation at the regional level (for example, the European Union), the national level (for example, the FCC) and, often, at the state, provincial, and local levels. We also operate in some areas of the world without licenses, but only as permitted through relationships with locally licensed partners. Regulating telecommunications networks and services around the world varies widely. In some countries, the range of services we are legally permitted to provide may be limited, or may change. In other countries, existing telecommunications legislation is in development, is unclear or inconsistent, or is applied in an unequal or discriminatory fashion, or inadequate judicial, regulatory or other forums are available to address these inadequacies or disputes. Changes to existing regulations or rules, or the failure to regulate going forward in areas historically regulated on matters such as network neutrality, licensing fees, environmental, health and safety, privacy, intercarrier compensation, interconnection and other areas, in general or particular to our industry, may increase costs, restrict operations or decrease revenue. Our inability or failure to comply with the telecommunications and other laws and regulations of one or more countries in which we operate could cause the temporary or permanent suspension of operations in one or more countries. We also may be prohibited from entering certain countries at all or from providing all of our services in one or more countries. In addition, many countries in which we operate are conducting regulatory or other proceedings that will affect the implementation of their telecommunications legislation. We cannot be certain of the outcome of these proceedings. These proceedings may affect how we may provide our services in these countries and the level of fees and taxes payable to the government.\nTermination of relationships with key suppliers could cause delay and additional costs.\nOur business depends on third-party suppliers for fiber, computers, software, optronics, transmission electronics and related components and providers of network colocation facilities and right of way rights that are integrated into our network, some of which are critical to operating our business. If any of these critical relationships is terminated, a supplier either exits or curtails its business because of economic conditions, a supplier fails to provide critical rights of use, services or equipment, or the supplier is forced to stop providing services due to legal constraints, such as patent infringement, and we cannot reach suitable alternative arrangements quickly, we may experience significant additional costs or we may not be able to provide certain services to customers.\nOur consolidated revenue is concentrated in a few customers.\nApproximately 16% of our consolidated revenue is concentrated among our top ten customers at year end 2016. If we lost one or more of our major customers, or, if one or more of them significantly decreased or terminated orders for our services, our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nILECs may not provide us local access services at prices that allow us to effectively compete.\nWe acquire a significant portion of our local access services, the connection between our owned network and the customer premises, from incumbent local exchange carriers or ILECs. The ILECs compete directly with our business and may have a tendency to favor themselves and their affiliates to our detriment. For instance, at the end of 2013, AT&T attempted to eliminate its longer term plans (and correspondingly larger discounts) used routinely by us to purchase certain local access services from AT&T. The price increases we would have seen as the result of losing these larger discounts, price increases we would have had little choice but to pass on to our customers, would have made competing with AT&T in its operating region more difficult. We and others objected to AT&T\u2019s filings at the FCC, and following FCC intervention, AT&T withdrew these unilateral price increases. We cannot predict what AT&T may try next, and what other incumbent telephone companies may pursue.\nNetwork access represents a very large portion of our total costs and if we face less favorable pricing and provisioning timeframes, we may be at a competitive disadvantage to the ILECs.\nSometimes it is expensive and difficult to switch new customers to our network, and lack of cooperation of incumbent carriers can slow the new customer connection process.\nIt is expensive, difficult and time-consuming for new customers to switch to our network if we require cooperation from the incumbent carrier where there is no direct connection between the customer and our network. Many of our principal competitors, the domestic and international incumbent carriers, are already established providers of local telephone services to all or virtually all telephone subscribers within their respective service areas. Their physical connections from their premises to those of their customers are expensive and difficult to duplicate. To complete the new customer provisioning process for a customer\u2019s location not located on our network, we rely on the incumbent carrier to process certain information. The incumbent carriers have a financial interest in retaining their customers, which could reduce their willingness to cooperate with our new customer provisioning requests, thereby adversely affecting our ability to compete and increase revenue. Further consolidation of incumbent carriers with other telecommunications service providers may make these problems more acute.\nWe may be liable for the information that content owners or distributors distribute over our network.\nThe law relating to the liability of private network operators for information carried on or disseminated through their networks is still unsettled. While we disclaim any liability for third-party content in our services agreements, we may become subject to legal claims relating to the content disseminated on our network, even though such content is owned or distributed by our customers or a customer of our customers. For example, lawsuits may be brought against us claiming that material distributed using our network was inaccurate, offensive, or violated the law or the rights of others. Claims could also involve matters such as defamation, invasion of privacy and copyright infringement. In addition, the law remains unclear over whether content may be distributed from one jurisdiction, where the content is legal, into another jurisdiction, where it is not. Companies operating private networks have been sued in the past, sometimes successfully, based on the nature of material distributed, even if the content is not owned by the network operator and the network operator has no knowledge of the content or its legality. It is not practical for us to monitor all of the content distributed using our network. We may need to take costly measures to reduce our exposure to these risks or to defend ourselves against such claims.\nWe may not efficiently and effectively integrate future acquired operations and thus may not fully realize the anticipated benefits from those future acquisitions.\nAchieving the anticipated benefits of any acquisitions depends in part upon whether we can integrate our businesses in an efficient and effective manner. We may acquire businesses in accordance\nwith our business strategy. Integrating any acquired businesses involves several risks, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\ndemands on management related to any significant increase in size after the acquisition;\n\u2022\nthe disruption of ongoing business and the diversion of management\u2019s attention from the management of daily operations to management of integration activities;\n\u2022\nfailure to fully achieve expected synergies and costs savings;\n\u2022\nunanticipated impediments in integrating departments, systems, including accounting systems, technologies, books and records, procedures and policies, and in maintaining uniform standards and controls, including internal control over financial reporting;\n\u2022\nloss of customers or the failure of customers to order incremental services we expect them to order;\n\u2022\nfailure to provision services ordered by customers during the integration period;\n\u2022\nhigher integration costs than anticipated; and\n\u2022\ndifficulties in the assimilation and retention of highly qualified, experienced employees, many of whom may be geographically dispersed.\nSuccessful integration of acquired businesses or operations depends on our ability to manage these operations, realize opportunities for revenue growth presented by strengthened service offerings and expanded geographic market coverage, obtain better terms from our vendors due to increased buying power, and eliminate redundant and excess costs to fully realize the expected synergies. Because of difficulties in combining geographically distant operations and systems which may not be fully compatible, we may not be able to achieve these objectives.\nWe cannot be certain that we will realize our anticipated benefits from our acquisitions, or that we can efficiently and effectively integrate acquired operations as planned.\nChanges in regulations affecting commercial power providers may increase our costs.\nIn the normal course of business, we must contract with many providers of commercial power for our office, network, Gateway facilities, and colocation and data center facilities. Costs of obtaining commercial power comprise a significant component of our operating expenses. Changes in regulations that affect commercial power providers, particularly regulations related to the control of greenhouse gas emissions or other climate change related matters, could affect the costs of commercial power, which may increase the costs of providing our services.\nPotential regulation of Internet service providers in the United States could adversely affect our operations.\nIn the United States, the FCC has, to date, treated Internet service providers as enhanced service providers. In addition, Congress has, to date, not sought to heavily regulate the provision of IP-based services. Both Congress and the FCC are considering proposals that involve greater regulation of IP-based service providers. Depending on the content and scope of any regulations, the imposition of such regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business and the profitability of our services.\nThe communications industry is highly competitive with participants with greater resources and a greater number of existing customers.\nThe communications industry is highly competitive. Many of our existing and potential competitors have financial, personnel, marketing and other resources significantly greater than ours. Many have the added competitive advantage of a larger existing customer base. In addition, significant new or increased competition could arise because of:\n\u2022\nthe consolidation in the industry;\n\u2022\nallowing foreign carriers to more extensively compete in the U.S. market;\n\u2022\nfurther technological advances; and\n\u2022\nfurther deregulation and other regulatory initiatives.\nIn addition, future significant competitors could include new entrants to the communications industry such as content companies that have existing significant customer bases and substantial cash resources that are greater than ours. If we cannot compete successfully, our business could be significantly affected.\nRapid technological changes can lead to further competition.\nThe communications industry is subject to rapid and significant changes in technology. In addition, the introduction of new services or technologies, and the further development of existing services and technologies, may reduce the cost or increase the supply of certain services similar to those that we provide. As a result, our most significant competitors in the future may be new entrants to the communications industry. These new entrants may not be burdened by an installed base of outdated equipment or obsolete technology. Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate and adapt in a timely manner to technological changes.\nOur international operations and investments expose us to risks that could materially adversely affect the business.\nWe have operations and investments outside of the United States, and rights to undersea cable capacity extending to other countries, that expose us to risks inherent in international operations. These include:\n\u2022\ngeneral economic, social and political conditions;\n\u2022\nthe difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems;\n\u2022\ntax rates in some countries may exceed those in the United States;\n\u2022\nUnited States and other country tax laws may limit our ability to repatriate cash from non-U.S. affiliates without adverse tax consequences;\n\u2022\nforeign currency exchange rates may fluctuate, which could adversely affect our results of operations and the value of our international assets and investments;\n\u2022\nnon-U.S. earnings may be subject to withholding requirements or the imposition of tariffs, exchange controls or other restrictions;\n\u2022\ndifficulties and costs of compliance with non-U.S. laws and regulations that impose restrictions on our investments and operations, with penalties for noncompliance, including loss of licenses and monetary fines;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in obtaining licenses or interconnection arrangements on acceptable terms, if at all; and\n\u2022\nchanges in laws and regulations relating to non-U.S. trade and investment.\nWe are exposed to significant currency exchange rate risks and currency transfer restrictions and our results may suffer due to currency translations and remeasurements.\nCertain of our current and prospective customers derive their revenue in currencies other than U.S. dollars but are invoiced by us in U.S. dollars. The obligations of customers with substantial revenue in foreign currencies may be subject to unpredictable and indeterminate increases if such currencies depreciate relative to the U.S. dollar. Furthermore, these customers may become subject to exchange control regulations restricting the conversion of their revenue currencies into U.S. dollars. In either event, the affected customers may not be able to pay us in U.S. dollars. Similarly, declines in the value of foreign currencies (such as the devaluation of the Brazilian real and the Argentine peso discussed below) relative to the U.S. dollar could adversely affect our ability to market our services to customers whose revenue is denominated in those currencies. In addition, where we issue invoices for our services in currencies other than U.S. dollars, our results of operations may suffer due to currency translations if such currencies depreciate relative to the U.S. dollar and we cannot or do not elect to enter into currency hedging arrangements regarding those payment obligations.\nWe conduct a portion of our business using the British pound, the euro and the Brazilian real. Appreciation of the U.S. dollar adversely affects our consolidated revenue. Since we tend to incur costs in the same currency in which those operations realize revenue, the effect on operating income and operating cash flow is largely mitigated. However, if the U.S. dollar appreciates significantly, future revenue, operating income and operating cash flows could be materially affected. In addition, the appreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies reduces the U.S. dollar value of cash balances held in those currencies.\nCertain Latin American economies have experienced shortages in foreign currency reserves and have adopted restrictions on the use of certain mechanisms to expatriate local earnings and convert local currencies into U.S. dollars. Any of these shortages or restrictions may limit or impede our ability to transfer or to convert those currencies into U.S. dollars and to expatriate those funds. In addition, currency devaluations in one country may have adverse effects in another country.\nEconomic and political conditions in Latin America pose numerous risks to our operations.\nOur business operations in the Latin American region constitute a significant portion of our business. As events in the Latin American region have demonstrated, negative economic or political developments in one country in the region can lead to or exacerbate economic or political instability elsewhere in the region. Furthermore, events in recent years in other developing markets have placed pressures on the stability of the currencies of several countries in Latin America in which we operate, including Argentina, Brazil and Colombia. While certain areas in the Latin American region have experienced economic growth, this recovery remains fragile. Pressures on local currencies are likely to have an adverse effect on our customers in this region. Volatility in regional currencies and capital markets could also have an adverse effect on our ability and that of our customers to gain access to international capital markets for necessary financing, refinancing and repatriation of earnings.\nIn addition, any changes to the political and economic conditions in certain Latin American countries could materially and adversely affect our business.\nInflation and certain government measures to curb inflation in some Latin American countries may have adverse effects on their economies and our business and operations in those locations.\nSome Latin American countries, including Brazil and Argentina, have historically experienced high rates of inflation. Inflation and some measures implemented to curb inflation have had significant negative effects on the economies of these countries. Governmental actions taken to curb inflation, coupled with speculation about possible future actions, have contributed to economic uncertainty at times in most Latin American countries. These countries may experience high levels of inflation in the future that could lead to further government intervention in the economy, including the introduction of government policies that could adversely affect our results of operations in those locations. In addition, if any of these countries experience high rates of inflation, we may not be able to adjust the price of our services sufficiently to offset the effects of inflation on our cost structures in those locations. A high inflation environment would also have negative effects on the level of economic activity and employment and adversely affect our business.\nOur agreements with certain agencies of the U.S. Government impose significant requirements on us. Violating those agreements could have severe consequences.\nWe are a party to an agreement with the U.S. Departments of Homeland Security, Justice and Defense addressing the U.S. government\u2019s national security and law enforcement concerns. This agreement imposes significant requirements on us related to information storage and management; traffic management; physical, logical, and network security arrangements; personnel screening and training; and other matters. We are also party to an agreement with the U.S. Department of Defense addressing the U.S. government\u2019s national security concerns. This agreement imposes significant requirements on us related to the composition and qualifications of the Level 3 Communications, Inc. board of directors; the limitation of the influence or control over us of non-U.S. persons; physical, logical, and network security arrangements; and other matters.\nWhile we expect to continue to comply fully with our obligations under both above-mentioned agreements, it is impossible to eliminate completely the risk of violating either. The consequences of violating these agreements could be severe, potentially including the revocation of our FCC licenses in the U.S., which would cause the cessation of our U.S. operations, and/or losing permissions required to do business with the U.S. Government.\nWe are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d) and other anticorruption laws, and our failure to comply therewith could cause penalties which could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to the FCPA, which generally prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business and/or other benefits. Although we have policies and procedures designed to ensure that we, our employees and agents comply with the FCPA and other anticorruption laws, there can be no assurance that such policies or procedures will work effectively all of the time or protect us against liability for actions taken by our agents, employees and intermediaries regarding our business or any businesses we acquire.\nWe currently operate and in the future may operate in several jurisdictions that pose a high risk of potential anticorruption violations. If we do not comply with the FCPA and other laws governing the conduct of business with government entities (including local laws), we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties and other remedial measures. Any investigation of any potential violations of the FCPA or other anticorruption laws by U.S. or foreign authorities could have an adverse effect on our business.\nThe U.K. Bribery Act 2010 (the \u201cBribery Act\u201d) reformed the United Kingdom (\u201cU.K.\u201d) law in relation to bribery and corruption. As well as containing provisions about bribery of public officials, the Bribery Act\nincludes a criminal offense of failing to prevent bribery by relevant commercial organizations. This offense applies when any person associated with the organization offers or accepts bribery anywhere in the world intending to obtain or retain a business advantage for the organization or in the conduct of business. The Bribery Act has wide ranging implications in particular for business in the U.K., including our subsidiaries. However, it also has a wide-ranging extra-territorial effect. The Bribery Act is broader in scope than the FCPA because it directly addresses commercial bribery besides bribery of government officials and it does not recognize certain exceptions, notably facilitation payments permitted by the FCPA. Under the Bribery Act, it is a defense to the accusation of failure to prevent bribery for a commercial organization to show it had in place \u201cadequate procedures\u201d designed to prevent such acts.\nAs with the FCPA, if we do not comply with the Bribery Act and similar laws in the U.K. or elsewhere, such as The Federal Law n. 12.846/13, which is known as the \u201cBrazilian Anti-corruption Law\u201d that became effective on February 2, 2014, that apply to our business, we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties and other remedial measures.\nRisks Related to Our Liquidity and Financial Resources\nDisruptions in the financial markets could affect our ability to obtain debt or equity financing or refinance our existing indebtedness on reasonable terms (or at all), and have other adverse effects on us.\nDisruptions in the commercial credit markets could cause a tightening of credit markets. The effects of recent credit market disruptions were widespread, and it is impossible to predict whether the improvement in the global credit markets will continue. Because of credit market turmoil, we may not obtain debt or equity financing or refinance our existing indebtedness on favorable terms (or at all), which could affect our strategic operations and our financial performance and force modifications to our operations.\nIf we cannot comply with the restrictions and covenants in our debt agreements, there would be a default under these agreements, and this could cause an acceleration of payment of funds borrowed.\nIf we were unable to comply with the restrictions and covenants in any of our debt agreements, there would be a default under those agreements. As a result, borrowings under other debt instruments that contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions may also be accelerated and become due and payable. If any of these events occur, there can be no assurance we could make necessary payments to the lenders or that we could find alternative financing. Even if we obtained alternative financing, there can be no assurance it would be on terms that are acceptable.\nIf we experience a change in control or certain other events, we may be unable to satisfy our obligations to repurchase our outstanding notes as required under our outstanding debt agreements.\nUpon the occurrence of certain events defined in the various debt agreements relating to our outstanding debt, we are required to make an offer to purchase all of our outstanding notes at a purchase price generally equal to 101% of the principal amount of the notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon (if any). In addition, if we must make an offer to purchase one of the outstanding issues of our notes, the debt agreements relating to our other issues of notes may require us to repurchase that other debt upon a change in control or termination of trading. We may not have or be able to borrow enough funds to pay the purchase price for all the notes tendered by holders seeking to accept the offer to purchase.\nWe have substantial debt, which may hinder our growth and put us at a competitive disadvantage.\nOur substantial debt may have important consequences, including:\n\u2022\nthe ability to obtain additional financing for acquisitions, working capital, investments and capital or other expenditures could be impaired or financing may not be available on acceptable terms;\n\u2022\na substantial portion of our cash flows will be used to make principal and interest payments on outstanding debt, reducing the funds otherwise available for operations and future business opportunities;\n\u2022\na substantial decrease in cash flows from operating activities or an increase in expenses could make it difficult to meet debt service requirements and force modifications to operations;\n\u2022\nhaving more debt than certain of our competitors may place us at a competitive disadvantage; and\n\u2022\nsubstantial debt may make us more vulnerable to a downturn in business or the economy generally.\nWe had a ratio of earnings to fixed charges of 2.3 for the year ended December 31, 2016, 1.4 for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 1.3 for the year ended December 31, 2014. We had substantial deficiencies of earnings to cover fixed charges of approximately $71 million and $374 million for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.\nWe may not be able to repay our existing debt; failure to do so or refinance the debt could prevent us from implementing our strategy and realizing anticipated profits.\nIf we could not refinance our debt or to raise additional capital on acceptable terms, our ability to operate our business would be impaired. As of December 31, 2016, we had an aggregate of approximately $11.009 billion of current and long-term debt on a consolidated basis (excluding debt discounts and fair value adjustments), and approximately $10.917 billion of stockholders\u2019 equity. Of the long-term debt, approximately $7 million is due to mature in 2017, $306 million is due to mature in 2018, $822 million is due to mature in 2019 and $1,804 million is due to mature in 2020, in each case excluding debt discounts and fair value adjustments. This information does not reflect the recent refinancing transaction completed by our wholly owned subsidiary, Level 3 Financing in the first quarter 2017.\nOur ability to make interest and principal payments on our debt and borrow additional funds on favorable terms depends on the future performance of the business. If we do not have enough cash flow in the future to make interest or principal payments on our debt, we may have to refinance all or a part of our debt or to raise additional capital. We cannot be sure that we will be able to refinance our debt or raise additional capital on acceptable terms.\nRestrictions and covenants in our debt agreements limit our ability to conduct our business and could prevent us from obtaining needed funds in the future.\nOur debt and financing arrangements contain several significant limitations that restrict our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nborrow additional money or issue guarantees;\n\u2022\npay dividends or other distributions to stockholders;\n\u2022\nmake investments;\n\u2022\ncreate liens on assets;\n\u2022\nsell assets;\n\u2022\nenter into sale-leaseback transactions;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022\nengage in mergers or consolidations.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe unpredictability of our quarterly results may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nOur revenue and operating results will vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to several factors, many of which are outside of our control and any of which may cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate. The primary factors, among other things, that may affect our quarterly results include:\n\u2022\nthe timing of costs associated with operating our business and integration activities regarding any completed acquisitions;\n\u2022\ndemand for our services;\n\u2022\nloss of customers or the ability to attract new customers;\n\u2022\nchanges in pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors;\n\u2022\ncosts related to acquisitions of technology or businesses;\n\u2022\nchanges in regulatory rulings; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions and those specific to the communications and related industries.\nA delay in generating revenue or the timing of recognizing revenue and expenses could cause significant variations in our operating results from quarter to quarter. It is possible that in some future quarters our results may be below analysts\u2019 and investors\u2019 expectations. In these circumstances, the price of our common stock will likely decrease.\nIf certain transactions occur regarding our capital stock, we may be unable to fully utilize our net operating loss carry forwards, or NOLs, to reduce our U.S. federal income taxes.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had NOLs of approximately $9 billion for U.S. federal income tax purposes (after taking into account the effects of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d)). If certain transactions occur regarding our capital stock that result in a cumulative ownership change of more than 50 percentage points by 5% stockholders over a three-year period as determined under rules prescribed by the Code and applicable regulations, annual limitations would be imposed regarding our ability to utilize our NOLs and certain current deductions against any taxable income we achieve in future periods.\nWe have entered into transactions over the applicable three-year period that, when combined with other changes in ownership that are outside of our control, have resulted in cumulative changes in the ownership of our capital stock. Additional transactions we enter into, and transactions by existing 5% stockholders and transactions by holders that become new 5% stockholders that we do not participate in, could cause us to incur a 50 percentage point ownership change by 5% stockholders and, if we trigger\nthe above noted Code imposed limitations, such transactions would prevent us from fully utilizing NOLs and certain current deductions to reduce our U.S. federal income taxes and could result in a substantial income tax expense to our consolidated statement of operations. In addition, these limitations could cause us not to pursue otherwise favorable acquisitions and other transactions involving our capital stock, or could reduce the net benefits to be realized from any such transactions.\nIn April 2011, we entered into the rights agreement to deter acquisitions of our common stock that might reduce our ability to use our NOLs. Under the rights agreement, from and after the record date of April 21, 2011, each share of our common stock carries with it one preferred share purchase right that could discourage a third-party from proposing a change of control or other strategic transaction concerning Level 3 or otherwise have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of Level 3 that other stockholders may view as beneficial.\nIn July 2014, the rights agreement was amended to provide that the rights issued under the rights agreement will expire at or prior to the earliest of:\n\u2022\nOctober 31, 2017;\n\u2022\nthe time at which the rights are redeemed;\n\u2022\nthe time at which the rights are exchanged;\n\u2022\nthe time at which our board of directors determines that the NOLs are utilized in all material respects or that an ownership change under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, would not adversely effect in any material respect the time period in which we could use the NOLs, or materially impair the amount of the NOLs we could use in any particular time period, for applicable tax purposes; or\n\u2022\na determination by our board of directors, prior to the date that the rights are distributed, that the rights agreement and the rights are no longer in our and our stockholders\u2019 best interests.\nUnder our certificate of incorporation, we can issue more shares of our common stock than are currently outstanding. Such future issuances of our common stock may have a dilutive effect on the earnings per share and voting power of our stockholders.\nOur certificate of incorporation, as currently in effect, authorizes us to issue to up to 433,333,333 shares of our common stock, which is a greater number of shares of common stock than are outstanding. If our Board of Directors elects to issue additional shares of common stock in the future, whether in public offerings, for mergers and acquisitions or otherwise, these additional issuances may dilute the earnings per share and voting power of our stockholders. Depending on the number of shares being issued and the particular circumstances, the Board of Directors may be able to complete a particular issuance without further stockholder action.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter and by-laws could limit the share price and delay a change of management.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation and by-laws contain provisions that could make it more difficult or even prevent a third-party from acquiring us without the approval of our incumbent Board of Directors. These provisions, among other things:\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent in place of a meeting;\n\u2022\nlimit the right of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022\nlimit the right of stockholders to present proposals or nominate directors for election at annual meetings of stockholders; and\n\u2022\nauthorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock in one or more series without any action on the part of stockholders.\nIn addition, the terms of most of our long-term debt require that upon a \u201cchange in control,\u201d as defined in the agreements that contain the terms and conditions of the long-term debt, we make an offer to purchase the outstanding long term debt at either 100% or 101% of the aggregate principal amount of that long term debt.\nThese provisions could limit the price that investors might pay in the future for shares of our common stock and significantly impede the ability of the holders of our common stock to change management. Provisions and agreements that inhibit or discourage takeover attempts could reduce the market value of our common stock.\nIf a large number of shares of our common stock is sold in the public market, the sales could reduce the trading price of our common stock and impede our ability to raise future capital.\nWe cannot predict what effect, if any, future issuances by us of our common stock will have on the market price of our common stock. In addition, shares of our common stock we issue in connection with an acquisition may not be subject to resale restrictions. The market price of our common stock could drop significantly if certain large holders of our common stock, or recipients of our common stock in connection with an acquisition, sell all or a significant portion of their shares of common stock or are perceived by the market as intending to sell these shares other than in an orderly manner. In addition, these sales could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional common stock in the capital markets.\nThe market price of our common stock has been volatile and, in the future, the market price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially due to many factors.\nThe market price of our common stock has been subject to volatility and, in the future, the market price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially due to many factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe depth and liquidity of the trading market for our common stock;\n\u2022\nvariations in actual or anticipated operating results;\n\u2022\nchanges in estimated results by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nmarket conditions in the communications and information services industries;\n\u2022\nannouncement and performance by competitors;\n\u2022\nregulatory actions; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions.\nIn addition, market fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on the market price or liquidity of our common stock.\nOther Risks\nWe have environmental liabilities from our historical operations.\nThere could be environmental liabilities arising from historical operations of our predecessors, for which we may be liable. Our operations and properties are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, human health and safety. These laws and regulations include those about the use and management of hazardous and non-hazardous substances and wastes. We have made and will continue to make significant expenditures relating to our environmental compliance obligations. Despite our best efforts, we may not at all times comply with all of these requirements.\nIn connection with certain historical operations, as of February 1, 2017, we have responded to or been notified of potential environmental liability at approximately 173 properties. We are engaged in addressing or have liquidated environmental liabilities at 89 of those properties. Of these: (a) we have formal commitments or other potential future costs at 23 sites; (b) there are nine sites with unknown future costs; and (c) there are 57 sites with no likely future costs. The remaining properties have been dormant for several years. We could potentially be held liable, jointly or severally, and without regard to fault, for the costs of investigation and remediation of these sites. The discovery of additional environmental liabilities related to historical operations or changes in existing environmental requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are exposed to legal proceedings and contingent liabilities that could result in material losses we have not reserved against.\nWe are party to various legal proceedings and are subject to certain important contingent liabilities described more fully in Note 15, \u201cCommitments, Contingencies and Other Items,\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. If one or more of these legal proceedings or contingent liabilities were to be resolved in a manner adverse to us, we could suffer material losses. Certain of these contingent liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business besides the effect of any potential monetary judgment or sanction against us. Furthermore, any legal proceedings, regardless of the outcome, could cause substantial costs and diversion of resources. Assets and entities we have acquired may be subject to unknown or contingent liabilities for which we may have no recourse, or only limited recourse to the entity from which the business was acquired (or its stakeholders).\nTerrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may adversely affect the financial markets and our business.\nThere can be no assurance there will not be future terrorist attacks. These attacks or armed conflicts may directly affect our physical facilities or those of our customers. These events could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the U.S. and world financial markets and economy. Any of these occurrences could materially adversely affect our business.\nThe pension plans previously maintained by Global Crossing and regarding our operations before 1997 may require additional funding and negatively affects cash flows.\nCertain North American and European hourly and salaried employees of Global Crossing are covered by defined benefit pension plans. On December 31, 1996, the North American plan was frozen and all employees hired thereafter are not eligible to participate in the plan. The U.K. plans were closed to new employees on December 31, 1999. The pension expense and required contributions to these pension plans are directly affected by the value of plan assets, the projected rate of return on plan assets, the actual rate of return on plan assets and the actuarial assumptions used to measure the defined benefit pension plan obligations. As of December 31, 2016, the projected benefit obligation under these pension plans and the pension plans regarding non-Global Crossing operations prior to 1997 was\napproximately $158 million ($69 million for U.S. plans and $89 million for U.K. plans) and the value of plan assets was approximately $136 million (approximately $67 million for U.S. plans and $69 million for U.K. plans), resulting in these pension plans being underfunded by $22 million. If plan assets perform below expectations, future pension expense and funding obligations will increase, which would have a negative effect on our cash flows from operations.", "PERMNO": 85991, "SIC": 4813, "TIC": "LVLT"}
