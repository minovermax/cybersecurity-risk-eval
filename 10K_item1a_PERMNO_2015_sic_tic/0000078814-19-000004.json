{"cik": "78814", "company": "PITNEY BOWES INC /DE/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-02-20", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur operations face certain risks that should be considered in evaluating our business. We manage and mitigate these risks on a proactive basis, including through the use of an enterprise risk management program. Nevertheless, the following risk factors, some of which may be beyond our control, could materially impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, brand and reputation, and may cause future results to be materially different than our current expectations. These risk factors are not intended to be all inclusive.\nSignificant disruptions to postal operations or adverse changes to our relationships with posts in the United States or elsewhere could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe are dependent on a healthy postal sector in the geographic markets where we operate both our mailing and shipping businesses, particularly in the United States. A significant portion of our revenue also depends on our contractual relationships with posts. Changes in the financial viability of the major posts, or the statutes and regulations determining how they operate, or changes in our contractual relationships with these posts, could materially adversely affect the financial performance of the businesses we conduct with them.\nWe are subject to postal regulations and processes, which could adversely affect our financial results.\nA significant portion of our business is subject to regulation and oversight by the USPS and posts in other major markets. These postal authorities have the power to regulate our current products and services and regulate and approve many of our new or future product and service offerings. If our new or future product and service offerings are not approved, if there are significant conditions to approval or, if regulations on our existing products or services are changed, our financial performance could be adversely impacted.\nIf we are not able to respond to the continuing decline in the volume of physical mail delivered via traditional postal services, our financial performance could be adversely impacted.\nTraditional mail volumes continue to decline and impact our current and future financial results. However, we have employed, and will continue to employ, strategies to stabilize the mailing business, including introducing new digital product and service offerings and providing clients broader access to products and services through online and direct sales channels. There is no guarantee that these offerings will be widely accepted in the marketplace, and they will likely face competition from existing and emerging alternative products and services.\nFurther, an accelerated or sudden decline in physical mail volumes could have an adverse effect on our mailing business. An accelerated or sudden decline could result from, among other things, changes in communication behavior, technologies, reductions to the Universal Service Obligation (USO) under which national posts, including the USPS, deliver to every address in a country with similar pricing and frequency, and legislation or regulations that mandate electronic substitution, prohibit certain types of mailings, increase the difficulty of using information or materials in the mail, or impose higher taxes or fees on postal services.\nIf we are not successful at meeting the continuing challenges faced in our mailing business, or if physical mail volumes were to experience an accelerated or sudden decline, our financial performance could be adversely impacted.\nIf we or our suppliers are unable to protect our information technology systems against misappropriation of data, or breaches of security resulting from cyberattacks or other similar events, our operations could be disrupted, our reputation may be harmed, the confidentiality of our data and intellectual property may be violated, and we could be subject to legal liability or regulatory enforcement action.\nWe depend on the security of our and our suppliers' information technology systems to support numerous business processes and activities, to support and service our clients and to support consumer transactions and postal services. Several of our businesses use, process and store proprietary information and personal, sensitive or confidential data relating to consumers and our businesses, clients and employees. Privacy laws and similar regulations in many jurisdictions where we do business require that we take significant steps to safeguard such information, and legal requirements continue to evolve. The scope of the laws that may be applicable to us is often uncertain and may be conflicting, particularly with respect to foreign laws. For example, the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which became effective in May 2018, greatly increases the jurisdictional reach of European Union law and adds a broad array of requirements for handling personal data, including the public disclosure of significant data breaches to supervisory authorities and affected parties. Other countries have enacted or are enacting data localization laws that require data to stay within their borders. All of these evolving compliance and operational requirements impose significant costs that are likely to increase over time.\nThere are numerous risks to cybersecurity and privacy, including individual and groups of criminal hackers, industrial espionage, denial of service attacks, computer viruses, vandalism and employee errors and/or malfeasance. These cyber threats are constantly evolving, thereby increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. We have security systems and procedures in place designed to ensure the continuous and uninterrupted performance of our information technology systems and to protect against unauthorized access to information. We also require our suppliers who host our information technology systems or have access to sensitive data to have appropriate security measures in place. However, there is no guarantee that these security measures will prevent or detect the unauthorized access by experienced computer programmers, hackers or others. Successful breaches could, among other things, result in the unauthorized disclosure, theft and misuse of company, client, consumer and employee sensitive and confidential information, disrupt the performance of our information technology systems and deny services to our clients. Additionally, we could be exposed to potential liability, litigation, governmental inquiries, investigations or regulatory enforcement actions, our brand and reputation damaged, and we could be subject to the payment of fines or other penalties, legal claims by our clients and significant remediation costs. Although we maintain insurance coverage relating to cybersecurity incidents, we may incur costs or financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through our insurance.\nAs we increase our reliance on cloud-based applications for both our internal and external services, if we or our suppliers encounter unforeseen interruptions or difficulties in the operation of those applications, our operations could be disrupted, our reputation and relationships may be harmed and our financial performance may be impacted.\nOur business relies upon the continuous and uninterrupted performance of our, and our suppliers', cloud-based applications and systems to support numerous business processes, to service our clients and to support consumer transactions and postal services. Our applications and systems, and those of our partners, may be subject to interruptions due to technological errors, system capacity constraints, software\nerrors or defects, human errors, computer or communications failures, power loss, adverse acts of nature and other unexpected events. We have business continuity and disaster recovery plans in place to protect our business operations in case of such events and we also require our suppliers to have the same. Nonetheless, there can be no guarantee that these plans will function as designed. If we are unable to limit interruptions or successfully correct them in a timely manner or at all, it could result in lost revenue, loss of critical data, significant expenditures of capital, a delay or loss in market acceptance of our services and damage to our reputation, brand and relationships, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial performance.\nWe depend on third-party suppliers and outsource providers and our business could be adversely affected if we fail to manage these vendors effectively.\nWe depend on third-party suppliers and outsource providers for a variety of services and product components, the hosting of our software-as-a-service offerings, the logistics portion of our ecommerce business, and some non-core functions and operations. Some of our suppliers may also be our competitors in other contexts. In certain instances, we rely on single-sourced or limited-sourced suppliers and outsourcing vendors around the world because doing so is advantageous due to quality, price or lack of alternative sources. If production or services were interrupted, or these third-party suppliers choose to terminate their relationship with us or make material changes to their businesses or if certain of their costs were to increase and we were not able to find alternate suppliers, we could experience significant disruptions in manufacturing and operations (including product shortages, higher freight costs and re-engineering costs) as well as increased costs in the logistics portion of our ecommerce business. If outsourcing services were interrupted, not performed, or the performance was poor, our ability to process, record and report transactions with our clients, consumers and other constituents could be impacted. Such interruptions, including a cybersecurity event, in the provision of supplies and/or services could impact our ability to meet client demand, damage our reputation and client relationships and adversely affect our financial performance.\nThe transformation of our businesses to more digital and commerce services will result in a decline in our overall profit margins. If we cannot increase our volumes while at the same time reduce our costs, our financial performance could be impacted.\nAs we transform our businesses to more digital and commerce services, the revenue contribution from our Commerce Services segments have increased relative to our SMB Solutions and Software Solutions segments and is expected to continue to increase in the future. The profit margins in Commerce Services are lower than the profit margins in SMB Solutions and Software Solutions. Additionally, rising labor and transportation costs have a bigger impact on profit margins in Commerce Services as compared to SMB Solutions and Software Solutions because in Commerce Services we rely on a significant number of hourly workers at our facilities and on third parties to transport packages on behalf of our clients. Margin improvement within Commerce Services is highly dependent on increasing volumes and lowering costs. Accordingly, if we cannot obtain sufficient scale by increasing our volumes while at the same time reducing our costs in Commerce Services significantly enough to improve profit margins, our overall financial performance could be adversely impacted.\nFuture credit rating downgrades or capital market disruptions could adversely affect our ability to maintain adequate liquidity to provide competitive financing services to our clients and to fund various discretionary priorities.\nOur financing activities include, among other things, providing competitive financing offerings to our clients and funding various discretionary priorities, such as business investments, strategic acquisitions, dividend payments and share repurchases. We fund these activities through a combination of cash generated from operations, deposits held at the Bank and access to capital markets. Our ability to access the U.S. capital markets and the associated cost of borrowing is dependent upon our credit ratings and is subject to capital market volatility. Given our current credit rating, we may not have immediate or sufficient access to the U.S. capital markets, and when we do access the U.S. capital markets, we may experience reduced financial or strategic flexibility as well as higher costs. To support our long-term strategic initiatives, our leverage may continue to increase, which could result in further credit rating downgrades. A significant decline in cash flows, further credit rating downgrades, material capital market disruptions, significant withdrawals by depositors at the Bank, adverse changes to our industrial loan charter or an increase in our credit default swap spread could impact our ability to maintain adequate liquidity to provide competitive finance offerings to our clients, refinance maturing debt and fund other financing activities, which in turn, could adversely affect our financial performance.\nThe international nature of our Global Ecommerce business exposes us to increased customs and regulatory risks from cross-border transactions and foreign exchange rate fluctuations. The loss of any of our largest clients in our Global Ecommerce segment could have a material adverse effect on the segment.\nOur Global Ecommerce segment is subject to significant trade regulations, taxes, and duties throughout the world. Any changes to these regulations could potentially impose increased documentation and delivery requirements, increase costs, delay delivery times, and subject us to additional liabilities, which could negatively impact our ability to compete in international markets and adversely impact our financial performance.\nThe sales generated from many of our clients\u2019 internationally focused websites running on our platform are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Currently, our platforms are located in the U.S., U.K. and Australia and a majority of consumers making purchases\nthrough these platforms are in a limited number of foreign countries. A strengthening of the U.S. Dollar or British Pound relative to currencies in the countries where we do the most business impacts our ability to compete internationally as the cost of similar international products improves relative to the cost of U.S. and U.K. retailers' products. A strong U.S. Dollar or British Pound would likely result in a decrease in international sales volumes, which would adversely affect the segment's revenue and profitability.\nThe Global Ecommerce segment receives a large portion of its revenue from a relatively small number of clients and business partners. The loss of any of these larger clients or business partners, or a substantial reduction in their use of our products or services, could have a material adverse effect on the revenue and profitability of the segment. There can be no assurance that our larger clients and business partners will continue to utilize our products or services at current levels, or that we would be able to replace any of these clients or business partners with others who can generate revenue at current levels.\nOur international operations may be adversely impacted by the United Kingdom's likely exit from the European Union.\nIn March 2017, the U.K. issued a formal notification of its intention to leave the European Union (EU). The U.K. is expected to exit the EU (Brexit) on March 29, 2019, unless an extension is agreed upon by the parties. Approximately 12% of our consolidated revenue is generated from counties in the EU, including the U.K. Although the ultimate outcome of Brexit is unknown, the effects of Brexit may adversely impact global economic conditions, contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets, impact trade and commerce, including the imposition of additional tariffs and duties and require additional documentation and inspection checks of the movement of goods between the U.K. and EU countries, leading to delays at ports of entry and departure. In particular, Brexit may have an adverse effect on cross-border ecommerce both into and out of the U.K. Brexit may also affect our supply chain for our International Mailing segment. Any of these and other changes, implications or consequences of Brexit could adversely affect our financial performance.\nOur operations may be negatively impacted by the recent developments in trade policies and tariffs.\nWe source certain parts and components used in our mailing products from manufacturers located outside of the U.S. and we sell certain of our products to customers located outside the U.S. The U.S. Administration has increased tariffs on certain goods imported into the U.S. from countries that we source parts and components from and has raised the possibility of imposing significant additional tariff increases. The announcement of tariffs on imported goods has triggered actions by certain foreign governments and may trigger additional actions by those and other foreign governments. These types of bilateral tariffs could materially increase the cost of certain import products, impact or limit the availability of such products, and/or decrease demand for certain of our products, which could adversely affect our financial performance. The tariffs already imposed have increased our costs and if such tariffs are increased any further, it will increase our costs even more.\nOur business depends on our ability to attract and retain employees at a reasonable cost to meet the needs of our business and to consistently deliver highly differentiated competitive offerings.\nGiven the rapid growth of the ecommerce industry, there has been intense competition for employees in the shipping, transportation and logistics industry, including drivers and factory employees. There is also significant competition for the talent needed to continue to develop our products. If we are unable to find and retain sufficient employees at a reasonable cost, or if the compensation required grows too rapidly, it may adversely affect our financial performance.\nOur inability to obtain and protect our intellectual property and defend against claims of infringement by others may negatively impact our financial performance.\nOur businesses are not materially dependent on any one patent or license or group of related patents and licenses; however, our business success depends in part upon protecting our intellectual property rights, including proprietary technology developed or obtained through acquisitions. We rely on copyrights, patents, trademarks and trade secrets and other intellectual property laws to establish and protect our proprietary rights. As we transition our business to more software and service-based offerings, product clearance and patent protection of these innovations are more difficult to obtain and we face increased risk of patent infringement assertions. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, our competitive position may suffer which could adversely affect our revenue and profitability. The continued evolution of patent law and the nature of our innovation work may affect the number of patents we are able to receive for our development efforts.\nFrom time to time, third-parties may claim that we, our clients, or our suppliers, have infringed their intellectual property rights. These claims, if successful, may require us to redesign affected products, enter into costly settlement or license agreements, pay damage awards, or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from marketing or selling certain products.\nIf we fail to comply with government contracting regulations, our financial performance, brand name and reputation could suffer.\nWe have a significant number of contracts with governmental entities, including the USPS. Government contracts are subject to extensive and complex procurement laws and regulations, along with regular audits and investigations by government agencies. If one or more government agencies discovers contractual noncompliance in the course of an audit or investigation, we may be subject to various civil or criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, which could include the termination of the contract, reimbursement of payments received, fines and debarment from doing business with one or more governments. Any of these events could not only affect us financially, but also adversely affect our brand and reputation.\nWe may not fully realize the anticipated benefits of strategic acquisitions and divestitures which may harm our financial performance.\nAs we transition our business to sustainable long-term growth, we may make strategic acquisitions or divest certain businesses. These actions may involve significant risks and uncertainties, which could have an adverse effect on our financial performance, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in achieving anticipated benefits or synergies;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in integrating any newly acquired businesses and operations, including combining product and service offerings and entering new markets, or reducing fixed costs previously associated with divested businesses;\n\u2022\nthe loss of key employees or clients of businesses acquired or divested;\n\u2022\nsignificant charges for employee severance and other restructuring costs, legal, accounting and financial advisory fees; and\n\u2022\npossible goodwill and asset impairment charges as divestitures and changes in our business model may adversely affect the recoverability of certain long-lived assets and valuation of our operating segments.\nOur capital investments to develop new products and offerings or expand our current operations may not yield the anticipated benefits.\nAs we transform the company\u2019s businesses, we are making significant capital investments in new products, services, and facilities. If we are not successful in these new product or service introductions at the levels anticipated when making the investments, there may be an adverse effect on our financial performance.\nOur operational costs could increase from changes in environmental regulations, or we could be subject to significant liabilities.\nWe are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental protection laws and regulations around the world, including without limitation, those related to the manufacture, distribution, use, packaging, labeling, recycling or disposal of our products or the products of our clients for whom we perform services. Environmental rules concerning products and packaging can have a significant impact on the cost of operations or affect our ability to do business in certain countries. We are also subject to laws concerning use, discharge or disposal of materials. All of these laws are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. If we are found to have violated these laws, we could be fined, criminally charged, otherwise sanctioned by regulators, or we could be subject to liability and clean-up costs. These risks can apply to both current and legacy operations and sites. From time to time, we may be involved in litigation over these issues. The amount and timing of costs under environmental laws are difficult to predict and there can be no assurance that these costs will not have an adverse effect on our financial performance.", "PERMNO": 24459, "SIC": 3579, "TIC": "PBI"}
