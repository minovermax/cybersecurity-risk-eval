{"cik": "789460", "company": "WORLD FUEL SERVICES CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-02", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nWe extend credit to most of our customers in connection with their purchase of fuel and services from us, and financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be adversely affected if we are unable to collect accounts receivable.\nOur success in attracting customers has been due, in part, to our willingness to extend credit on an unsecured basis to customers as opposed to requiring prepayment, letters of credit or other forms of credit support. Even in cases where we do obtain credit enhancements, such as guarantees, offset rights, collateral or other forms of security, such rights may not be sufficient or fully collectible depending on the circumstances of the customer at the time of default. Furthermore, the diversification of our credit risk is limited, as we primarily conduct business within the aviation, marine and land transportation industries.\nOur exposure to credit losses depends on the financial condition of our customers and other macroeconomic factors beyond our control, such as deteriorating conditions in the world economy or in the industries we serve, changes in oil prices and political instability. While we actively manage our credit exposure and work to respond to both changes in our customers\u2019 financial conditions or macroeconomic events, there can be no guarantee we will be able to mitigate all of these risks successfully. Substantial credit losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nA material portion of our profitability is derived from sales to government customers, particularly sales to NATO in Afghanistan, and the loss or material reduction in business from such sales, would likely have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nSales to government customers represent a material portion of our profitability. In particular, sales to NATO in support of military operations in Afghanistan accounted for approximately 18% of our consolidated gross profit in 2019. Our sales to government customers may fluctuate significantly as a result of the level of troop deployments and related activity in a particular region or area. The U.S. government has announced its intention to significantly reduce the level of U.S. troops in the Middle East, including the troops supporting NATO in Afghanistan. The timing, extent and impact of any such withdrawal is currently uncertain.\nIn addition, our sales to government customers can fluctuate significantly due to the commencement, extension, renewal or completion of existing and new government contracts. Our contract with NATO governing sales in Afghanistan provided for an initial two-year term expiring in December 2019, with three one-year renewal options at NATO\u2019s discretion. During the quarter ended September 30, 2019, NATO exercised the first of the one-year renewal options such that the current term now ends in December 2020. There is no guarantee that NATO will exercise the other two renewal options and it may decide to put the contract through a new competitive bid process.\nSales to government customers can also be materially impacted by factors such as supply disruptions, border closures, road blockages, hostility-related product losses, inventory shortages and other logistical difficulties that can arise when sourcing and delivering fuel in areas that are actively engaged in war or other military conflicts. Moreover, there is a risk of serious injury or loss of life of our employees or subcontractors operating in these high-risk locations. We therefore may incur substantial operating costs as a result of, among other things, hostility-related product losses, utilizing alternate supply routes or maintaining the safety of our personnel, particularly where our facilities are likely to be targeted by terrorist activity.\nFinally, due to complex supply logistics, the indefinite nature of government contracts, and the associated risks of doing business in areas engaged in war or military conflict, sales of products and services to government customers in support of military operations typically carry significantly higher net margins than sales to commercial customers. As a result, a significant decrease in sales to our government customers, or loss of a key contract, such as our NATO agreement, would result in a disproportionate reduction in our consolidated operating income and, thus, would likely have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nSales to government customers involve unique risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIn addition to normal business risks, our supply of products and services to government customers subjects us to unique risks, many of which are beyond our control. These risks include:\n\u2022\nDependence on government spending on defense programs, which can be negatively affected by budgetary constraints, changes in defense spending policies, government shutdowns and changes in military policies or priorities;\n\u2022\nContract awards that are typically made through a competitive bidding process, which can involve substantial costs and managerial time to prepare and submit bids for contracts that may not be awarded to us;\n\u2022\nExpense and delays that may arise if our competitors protest or challenge contract awards made to us;\n\u2022\nContracts for indefinite delivery, such that there are no guarantees on the quantity or timing of the government customer\u2019s purchase from us; and\n\u2022\nThe ability for government customers to unilaterally modify certain terms and conditions in existing contracts or terminate existing contracts for their convenience.\nFurthermore, government customer contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations and a variety of other complex requirements, which affect how we transact business with our government customers and can impose additional costs on our business operations. Numerous laws and regulations affect our U.S. government contracts, including the Federal Acquisition Regulation, which governs the formation, administration and performance of government contracts, and the federal False Claims Act, which provides for substantial criminal and civil penalties and treble damages where a contractor presents a false or fraudulent claim to the U.S. government for payment. Similar laws and regulations also may apply to our contracts with foreign government and intergovernmental agency customers.\nGovernment customers routinely audit government contractors to review contract performance, cost structure and compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and standards, as well as the adequacy of and compliance with internal control systems and policies. Any costs found to be misclassified or inaccurately allocated may not be reimbursable, and to the extent already reimbursed, may need to be refunded and could subject us to a variety of government claims. Also, any inadequacies in our systems and policies could result in payments being withheld, penalties and reduced future business. Improper or illegal activities, including those caused by our subcontractors, could subject us to civil or criminal penalties or administrative sanctions, including contract termination, fines, forfeiture of fees, suspension of payment and suspension or debarment from doing business with government agencies, any of which could materially adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in the market price of fuel may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFuel prices are impacted by many factors beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nglobal economic conditions;\n\u2022\nchanges in global crude oil and natural gas prices;\n\u2022\nexpected and actual supply and demand for fuel;\n\u2022\nthe ability or willingness of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (\u201cOPEC\u201d) to set and maintain production levels for oil;\n\u2022\noil and gas production levels by non-OPEC countries;\n\u2022\ngeopolitical conditions;\n\u2022\nlaws and regulations related to environmental matters, including those mandating or incentivizing alternative energy sources or otherwise addressing global climate change;\n\u2022\nchanges in pricing or production controls by various organizations and oil producing countries;\n\u2022\nenergy conservation efforts and technological advances affecting energy consumption or supply;\n\u2022\nregulatory changes in commodities markets, including any that impact derivatives related to those commodities;\n\u2022\nprice and availability of alternative fuels and energy sources; and\n\u2022\nweather and natural disasters.\nDuring times of high fuel prices, our customers may not be able to purchase as much fuel from us because of their credit limits with us and the resulting adverse impact on their business could cause them to be unable to make payments owed to us for fuel purchased on credit. In addition, if fuel prices increase, our own credit limits could prevent us from purchasing enough fuel from our suppliers to meet our customers\u2019 demands or could require us to prepay for fuel purchases which would adversely impact our liquidity.\nConversely, extended periods of low fuel prices, particularly when coupled with low price volatility, can also have an adverse effect on our results of operations and overall profitability. This outcome can be due to many factors, including reduced demand from our customers involved in the oil exploration sector and for our price risk management products. Low fuel prices also facilitate increased competition by reducing financial barriers to entry and enabling existing, lower-capitalized competitors to conduct more business as a result of lower working capital requirements.\nFinally, we maintain fuel inventories for competitive or logistical reasons. Because fuel is a commodity, we have no control over the changing market value of our inventory though we may manage or hedge this price exposure with derivatives. Our inventory is principally valued using the weighted average cost methodology and is stated at the lower of average cost or net realizable value. A rapid decline in fuel prices could cause a reduction in our inventory valuation, resulting in our inventory being marked down to net realizable value or the inventory itself sold at lower prices. While we attempt to mitigate these fluctuations through hedging, such hedges may not be fully effective. Accordingly, if the market value of our inventory is less than our average cost and to the extent our hedges are not effective at mitigating fluctuations in prices, we could record a write-down of inventory on hand and incur a non-cash charge or suffer losses as fuel is sold, which could adversely impact our earnings.\nOur failure to comply with U.S. or foreign tax laws or a government challenging our tax position could adversely affect our business and future operating results.\nWe are subject to various U.S. and foreign taxes, including income taxes and taxes imposed on the purchase and sale of aviation, marine and land fuel products, such as sales, excise, value-added tax (\u201cVAT\u201d), energy, environmental and other taxes. We have also benefited from an income tax concession in Singapore since 2008 which reduces the income tax rate on qualified sales and derivative gains and losses. Our current five year concession period began January 1, 2018. The concession is conditional upon our meeting certain employment and investment thresholds which, if not met in accordance with our agreement, may eliminate the benefit beginning with the first year in which the conditions are not satisfied. Changes in U.S. and foreign tax laws, our failure to comply with such regulations or the loss of the tax concession could adversely affect our tax expense and effective tax rate, and therefore negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows.\nFurthermore, significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our tax expense includes estimates of additional tax that may be incurred for tax exposures and reflects various estimates and assumptions, including assessments of future earnings that could affect the valuation of our net deferred tax assets. Our operating results could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in our overall profitability, changes in tax legislation, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our income tax exposures.\nFrom time to time, we are under review by the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) and various other domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to income tax and indirect tax matters and are involved in various inquiries, audits, challenges and litigation in a number of countries, including, in particular, Brazil, Denmark, South Korea and the U.S., where the amounts under controversy may be material. We are in the process of addressing and responding to inquiries in various jurisdictions and challenging a number of tax assessments in several administrative and legal proceedings, each of which is at various stages in the process. In addition, in some jurisdictions, these challenges require the posting of collateral or payment of the contested amount which may affect our flexibility in operating our business or our liquidity. If these challenges are ultimately determined unfavorably to us, these proceedings may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, any failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or appropriately resolve these challenges could subject us to administrative, civil or criminal penalties, including fines, penalties, disgorgement, injunctions and damage to our reputation. See notes 9 and 11 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding certain tax matters.\nFinally, ongoing developments including the project by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (\u201cOECD\u201d) on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (\u201cBEPS\u201d), European Commission anti-tax avoidance directives (\u201cATAD\u201d), and other initiatives, could adversely affect our worldwide effective tax rate. With the finalization of specific actions contained within the OECD\u2019s BEPS study many OECD countries have begun to implement the actions and update their local tax laws, including ATAD directives. The extent to which countries in which we operate adopt and implement these actions could have a material adverse impact on our income tax expense, effective tax rate, financial condition, and results of operations and cash flows.\nU.S. tax legislation, as well as future changes that may be made to regulatory, fiscal and trade policies, may materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d), enacted on December 22, 2017, significantly changed the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, by, among other things, reducing the U.S. corporate income tax rate, modifying or repealing many business deductions and credits, adopting elements of a territorial tax system, taxing global intangible low-taxed income (\u201cGILTI\u201d), assessing a repatriation tax or \u201ctoll-charge\u201d on undistributed earnings and profits of U.S.-owned foreign corporations, and introducing certain base erosion and anti-abuse minimum tax (\u201cBEAT\u201d) provisions. Several final and proposed regulations were issued during 2019 regarding BEAT, foreign tax credits, and GILTI, among other areas. For example, the Treasury Department released final and proposed regulations regarding BEAT on December 2, 2019 and provided an election to waive deductions for purposes of determining base erosion payments, which we elected to apply to both 2018 and 2019.\nThe Tax Act legislation will continue to require further interpretations and implementing regulations by the IRS, as well as state tax authorities, and the legislation could be subject to potential amendments and changes, any of which could increase certain adverse impacts or other effects of the legislation. The changes included in the Tax Act are broad and complex. The final transition impacts of the Tax Act may differ from our estimates, possibly materially, due to, among other items, changes in interpretations of the Tax Act, any legislative action to address questions that arise because of the Tax Act, any changes in accounting standards for income taxes or related interpretations in response to the Tax Act, or any updates or changes to current year earnings and tax estimates.\nIf we are unable to successfully take actions to manage the adverse impacts of the new tax legislation, or if additional interpretations, regulations, amendments or technical corrections exacerbate the adverse impacts or other effects of the legislation, the legislation could have a material adverse effect on our tax provision, effective tax rate, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFailure to comply with applicable laws or other government regulations could result in liabilities, penalties or costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are required to comply with extensive and complex laws and other regulations at the international, federal, state/provincial and local government levels in the countries in which we operate relating to, among other things:\n\u2022\nthe transportation, handling and delivery of fuel and fuel products;\n\u2022\nthe operation of fuel storage, blending and distribution facilities;\n\u2022\nlabor, employment and workplace safety;\n\u2022\nenvironmental protection, carbon emissions and hazardous waste disposal;\n\u2022\nconsumer protection;\n\u2022\nintellectual property;\n\u2022\ndata privacy and protection;\n\u2022\ncommodities trading, brokerage, derivatives and advisory services;\n\u2022\ncredit and payment card processing and payment services;\n\u2022\ngovernment contracting and procurement;\n\u2022\nantitrust and competition;\n\u2022\nanti-money laundering, financial services, and funds transmission; and\n\u2022\nregulatory reporting and licensing.\nDue to the complex and technical nature of these laws and regulations, inadvertent violations may occur. If we fail to comply with these laws or regulations for any reason, we would be required to correct or implement measures to prevent a recurrence of any violations, which could increase our operating costs. If more severe violations were to occur, we could be subject to substantial fines or penalties, or to civil or criminal liability. Any substantial fines and costs incurred as a result of a violation of such regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur physical operations have inherent risks that could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe provide various products and services to customers, directly or through third parties on our behalf, including into-plane fueling at airports, fueling of vessels in port and at sea, on the ground fueling of customer storage tanks and vehicles, and transportation, delivery and storage of fuel and fuel products. Operating fuel storage and distribution terminals and transporting fuel products involve inherent risks, including:\n\u2022\nfires, collisions and other catastrophic disasters;\n\u2022\ntraffic accidents, injuries and loss of life;\n\u2022\nspills, discharges, contaminations and other releases;\n\u2022\nsevere damage and destruction of property and equipment; and\n\u2022\nloss of product and business interruption.\nAny of the foregoing could result in distribution difficulties and disruptions, environmental pollution, government-imposed fines or clean-up obligations, personal injury or wrongful death claims, or damage to our properties and the properties of others. While we keep business continuity plans to address these types of contingencies, our failure to timely or properly implement these continuity plans could exacerbate the impact on the business. We generally maintain liability insurance for these types of events, however, such insurance may be insufficient to cover certain losses which may be in excess of coverage limits or outside the scope of the coverage. If we are held liable for any damages, and the liability is not adequately covered by insurance, our financial position and results of operations will be adversely affected. Furthermore, the occurrence of any of these events could result in negative media coverage and damage to our reputation, whether or not we were ultimately held financially liable for such event, which could adversely affect our business.\nIn addition, as we invest more heavily in physical assets in certain locations, our ability to quickly reposition our business in the event of a downturn in the economy of a particular geographic area where we have set up the physical assets becomes increasingly more difficult. Accordingly, we may be forced to incur significant costs in maintaining or even exiting a physical location, which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nFinally, some of our employees are represented by labor unions under collective bargaining agreements, including certain of our truck drivers that transport and deliver fuel and fuel-related products. Employees who are not currently represented by labor unions may seek union representation in the future, and any renegotiation of current collective bargaining agreements may result in terms that are less favorable to us. Although we believe that our relations with our employees are good, if our unionized workers were to engage in a strike, work stoppage or other slowdowns in the future, we could experience a significant disruption of our operations. Such disruption could interfere with our ability to transport and deliver products on a timely basis and could have other negative effects, including decreased productivity and increased labor costs. A significant labor dispute with our own union employees, or by the union employees of third parties who provide services for our business, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nEconomic, political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our business and future operating results.\nBecause we offer fuel products and services on a worldwide basis, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. Our business and future operating results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\ntrade protection measures and import, export and other licensing requirements, which could increase our costs or prevent us from doing certain business internationally;\n\u2022\nthe costs of hiring and retaining senior management for overseas operations;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations, which could reduce our productivity;\n\u2022\nchanges in regulatory requirements, which may be costly and require significant time to implement;\n\u2022\nlaws restricting us from repatriating profits earned from our activities within foreign countries, including making distributions;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\ngovernmental actions that may result in the deprivation of our contractual rights or the inability to obtain or retain authorizations required to conduct our business;\n\u2022\npolitical risks, including changes in governments; and\n\u2022\nterrorism, war, civil unrest and natural disasters and other weather-related events.\nIn particular, we operate in certain international markets which have been plagued by corruption and have uncertain regulatory environments, either of which could have a negative impact on our operations there. Furthermore, many countries in which we operate have historically been, and may continue to be, susceptible to recessions or currency devaluations.\nFinally, the U.S. has instituted or proposed changes in trade policies that include the negotiation or termination of trade agreements, the imposition of higher tariffs on U.S. imports and other government regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries. Recently, the Trump Administration negotiated a replacement trade deal for the North\nAmerican Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with Mexico and Canada, known as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which must be ratified by Canada before going into force. The Trump administration has also announced tariffs on certain products from China, and China has imposed tariffs in response to the actions of the U.S. If additional tariffs or trade restrictions are implemented by the U.S. or other countries, whether as retaliation or in connection with a global trade war, global trade may be significantly reduced, which can adversely affect the demand for our products and services. We cannot predict the magnitude of the impact to our business as a result of these or other proposed changes to trade policies and treaties, however, to the extent these actions intensify or continue for an extended period of time, they could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdverse conditions or events affecting the aviation, marine and land transportation industries may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business is focused on the marketing of fuel and other related products and services primarily to the aviation, marine and land transportation industries, which are generally affected by economic cycles. Therefore, weak economic conditions can have a negative impact on the business of our customers which may, in turn, have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, any political instability, terrorist activity, piracy, military action, transportation, terminal or pipeline capacity constraints, natural disasters and other weather-related events that disrupt shipping, flight operations, land transportation or the availability of fuel, may adversely affect us and our customers and may reduce the demand for our products and services.\nOur business could also be adversely affected by increased merger activity in the aviation, marine or land transportation industries, which may reduce the number of customers that purchase our products and services, as well as the prices we are able to charge for such products and services. For example, the shipping and aviation industries have gone through a period of significant consolidation, which has created a concentration of volume among a limited number of larger shipping companies and commercial airlines. Larger shipping companies and airlines often have greater leverage, are more sophisticated purchasers of fuel and have a greater ability to buy directly from major oil companies and suppliers. Accordingly, this can negatively impact our value proposition to these types of customers and increases the risk of disintermediation.\nFinally, global health crises such as the coronavirus outbreak emanating from China at the beginning of 2020, can significantly impact us and our customers and suppliers. For example, airline and cruise travel as well as the global shipping and air cargo industries have been negatively impacted by the coronavirus outbreak due to increased travel restrictions and may be further adversely affected by an extended shutdown of various businesses in the affected region. In light of this operating environment, shipping companies that carry goods from China to the rest of the world may begin to significantly reduce the number of seaborne vessels as measures to stop the spread of the coronavirus negatively impacts the demand for transport of containerized goods. This in turn can adversely affect our sales of marine fuels to these shipping customers if many vessels sit idle or are taken out of service during the outbreak. If the outbreak continues for an extended period of time, the overall financial condition of some of our customers may deteriorate such that there is a greater risk of default on the amounts they may owe to us. Any additional political or governmental developments or health concerns in China or other countries in which we or our customers operate, could also result in further social, economic or labor instability. Accordingly, the effects of these uncertainties on us or our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we fail to provide products or services to our customers as agreed, it could adversely affect our business.The success of our business depends on our ability to purchase, sell and coordinate delivery of fuel and related services to our customers. Because we rely on the availability and supply of fuel and fuel related products and third parties, our business, sales and future operating results may be negatively impacted by a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\npolitical instability, natural disasters or weather-related events, transportation, terrorist activity, piracy, military action or other similar conditions or events disrupting the availability or supply of fuel;\n\u2022\nreliance on a single or limited number of fuel suppliers in certain markets to sell us fuel on commercially reasonable terms;\n\u2022\nselling fuel and other products that fail to meet contractual specifications agreed to with customers or required by law or regulation, such as non-compliance with the International Maritime Association's low sulfur fuel oil requirements that went into effect on January 1, 2020 (\"IMO 2020\");\n\u2022\nsubstantial costs associated with enforcing our rights against suppliers; and\n\u2022\nthird parties we use to provide services to our customers, including into-plane fueling at airports, fueling of vessels in ports and at sea and delivering land-based fuel products, failing to perform in accordance with contractual terms.\nIf the fuel and other products we sell or the services we provide, either directly or through a third party, fail to meet the specifications we have agreed to with customers or are mandated by law or regulation, our relationship with our customers could be adversely affected and we could be subject to material claims and liabilities. We could also incur material liabilities if such products cause physical damage to a vessel or aircraft, bodily injury or result in other losses such that a customer initiates a claim or a lawsuit for which we settle or results in a decision against us. Also, adverse publicity about any allegations of contaminated products may negatively impact us, regardless of whether the allegations are true. Although most of our agreements with suppliers provide that we have recourse against them for products that fail to meet contractual specifications, such recourse may be time-barred or otherwise insufficient to adequately cover the liability we incur and our ability to enforce such recourse may be limited or costly. For example, several of our supply agreements are with foreign entities, including foreign governments, and are governed by the laws of foreign jurisdictions. Enforcing our rights against a local supplier in a foreign jurisdiction may be substantial and the ultimate outcome can be unpredictable. Any material liability in excess of any applicable insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe also use third parties to provide various services to our customers, including into-plane fueling at airports, fueling of vessels in ports and at sea and delivering land-based fuel products. The failure of these third parties to perform these services in accordance with contractual terms for any reason, such as their inability to supply specified fuel at the requisite time or an interruption of business because of weather, environmental or labor difficulties or political unrest, could affect our relationships with our customers and subject us to claims and other liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur operations and financial results may be adversely impacted by climate change and the market and regulatory responses to climate change.\nClimate change continues to attract considerable public and scientific attention in the U.S. and in foreign countries. As a result, numerous proposals have been made and could continue to be made at the international, national, regional and state levels of government to monitor and limit GHG emissions. These efforts have included consideration of cap-and-trade programs, carbon taxes, GHG reporting and tracking programs, and regulations that directly limit GHG emissions from certain sources. For instance, on September 10, 2018, California enacted SB-100, which requires California to transition to a fully renewable energy grid devoid of fossil fuels by 2045 and utility providers to generate 60% of their power from renewable sources by 2030. In the EU, there is a commitment to cut carbon dioxide emissions by at least 40% by 2030 and EU member states have implemented a range of subsidies and incentives to achieve the EU\u2019s climate change goals. Further, emissions are regulated via a number of means, including the European Union Emissions Trading System (\u2018\u2018EU ETS\u2019\u2019), which is a trading system across the EU for industrial emissions. The EU ETS is expected to become progressively more stringent over time, including by reducing the number of allowances to emit GHGs.\nThe adoption and implementation of any U.S. federal, state or local laws or regulations or foreign laws or regulations imposing obligations on, or further limiting emissions of GHGs could impose significant additional costs on us, our suppliers, our vendors, and our customers or could adversely affect demand for our energy products. The potential increase in our operating costs could include additional costs to operate and maintain our facilities, such as installing new infrastructure or technology to respond to new mandates, or paying taxes related to our GHG emissions, among others. In addition, changes in regulatory policies that result in a reduction in the demand for hydrocarbon products that are deemed to contribute to GHGs, or restrict their use, may impact our sales of fuel products. Furthermore, increased awareness and any adverse publicity in the global marketplace about potential impacts on climate change by us or other companies in our industry could harm our reputation.\nFinally, the potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain and would be particular to the geographic areas in which we operate. These may include changes in rainfall and storm patterns and intensities, hurricanes, changing sea levels, and changing temperatures that may impact the seasonality of our business, such as our heating oil business in the U.K. The occurrence of any of the foregoing factors could increase our costs and the prices we charge our customers, reduce the demand for our products, and therefore adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAdvancements in technology that significantly reduce fuel consumption would adversely affect our business.\nFuel competes with other sources of energy, some of which are less costly on an equivalent energy basis. There have been significant governmental incentives and consumer pressures to increase the use of alternative fuels in the U.S. and abroad. A number of automotive, industrial and power generation manufacturers are developing more fuel-efficient engines, hybrid engines and alternative clean power systems. The more successful these alternatives become as a\nresult of governmental incentives or regulations, technological advances, consumer demand, improved pricing or otherwise, the greater the potential negative impact on pricing and demand for our products and services and accordingly, our profitability. If our customers implement new technologies that increase fuel efficiency, it will likely result in decreased demand for the fuel products we provide. For example, commercial airlines are continuing to acquire more fuel-efficient planes to lower their operating costs. Accordingly, a significant increase in fuel efficiency across a large number of planes will result in a corresponding decrease in the demand for jet fuel, which would negatively impact our sales volume to airline customers.\nOur business is dependent on our ability to adequately finance our capital requirements and fund our investments, which, if not available to us, would impact our ability to conduct our operations.\nWe rely on credit arrangements with banks, suppliers and other parties as an important source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by our operating cash flow. Future market volatility, generally, and persistent weakness in global energy markets may adversely affect our ability to access capital and credit markets or to obtain funds at low interest rates or on other advantageous terms. If we are unable to obtain credit as and when we need it on commercially reasonable terms or at all, such as in the event there is a substantial tightening of the global credit markets or a substantial increase in interest rates, it could have a negative impact on our liquidity, business, financial condition, and cash flows, as well as our future development and growth. Furthermore, our business is impacted by the availability of trade credit to fund fuel purchases and an actual or perceived decline in our liquidity or operations could cause our suppliers to seek credit support in the form of additional collateral, limit the extension of trade credit, or otherwise materially modify their payment terms. Adverse changes in our payment terms from principal suppliers, including shortened payment cycles, decreased credit lines or requiring prepayment could impact our liquidity, business, results of operations and cash flows.\nFinally, if we are unable to obtain debt or other forms of financing and instead raise capital through equity issuance, existing shareholders would be diluted. Even if we can obtain financing, the restrictions our creditors may place on our operations or our increased interest expense and leverage could limit our ability to grow.\nImplementation of our growth strategy may place a strain on our management, operational and financial resources, as well as our information systems.\nA key element of our business strategy has been the growth of our business through acquisitions and strategic investments and divestitures. However, this growth strategy may place a strain on our management, operational and financial resources, as well as our information systems and expose us to additional business and operating risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u2022\nour ability to effectively and efficiently integrate the operations, financial reporting, and personnel of acquired businesses and manage acquired businesses or strategic investments, while maintaining uniform standards and controls;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from other business concerns;\n\u2022\nthe potentially negative impact of changes in management on existing business relationships and other disruptions of our business;\n\u2022\nthe risks associated with entering into transactions or markets in which we may have no or limited direct prior experience;\n\u2022\nthe retention of key employees, customers or suppliers of the acquired businesses;\n\u2022\na decrease in our liquidity resulting from a material portion of our available cash or borrowing capacity being used to fund acquisitions and a corresponding increase in our interest expense or financial leverage if we incur additional debt to finance acquisitions;\n\u2022\nthe ability to integrate the IT systems and technology of acquired businesses into our existing infrastructure and manage those systems and technologies that cannot be effectively integrated;\n\u2022\nthe requirement to write down acquired assets in the event the acquired business or strategic investment is worth less than we paid for or invested in it;\n\u2022\ncapital expenditure requirements that exceed our initial estimates and impact the return on our investment;\n\u2022\nthe assumption of material liabilities, exposure to litigation, regulatory noncompliance or unknown liabilities associated with the acquired businesses, as well as no or limited indemnities from sellers or ongoing indemnity obligations to purchasers; and\n\u2022\nthe need to implement internal controls, procedures and policies appropriate for a public company at companies that before the acquisition may have lacked such formal controls, procedures and policies.\nThese risks may result in an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition or result in costs that outweigh the financial benefit of such opportunities. Furthermore, these acquisitions or strategic investments may result\nin us incurring significant expenses or consummating potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities to fund the required capital investment. This could adversely affect the market price of our common stock, inhibit our ability to pay dividends or otherwise restrict our operations.\nWe may not be able to fully recognize the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions and other strategic investments.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we have been pursuing acquisition opportunities complementary to our business portfolio. From time to time, we may also enter into strategic investments such as joint venture arrangements or equity investments intended to complement or expand a portion of our business. Our ability to successfully implement our growth strategy depends on our ability to find attractive acquisition candidates or strategic investments and consummate such transactions on economically acceptable terms. Before making acquisitions or other strategic investments, we conduct due diligence that we deem reasonable and appropriate based on the facts and circumstances applicable to each investment. We rely, among other things, on our due diligence, representations and warranties of the sellers, financial statements and records of target businesses to establish the anticipated revenues and expenses and whether the acquisitions or strategic investments will meet our internal guidelines for current and future potential returns. Our due diligence investigation and other information we rely on with respect to any opportunity may not reveal or highlight all relevant risks and issues that may be necessary or helpful in evaluating such opportunity. Consequently, these transactions could result in (i) an adverse impact on our overall profitability if the acquisitions or strategic investments do not achieve the projected financial results, (ii) unanticipated costs that may impact our results of operations, and (iii) increased demands on our cash resources that may, among other things, impact our ability to explore other opportunities. If our acquisitions or strategic investments do not achieve the financial results anticipated, it could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.\nIntegration difficulties, or any other factors that make operating the acquired businesses more challenging following the completion of the acquisitions, may also prevent us from realizing the benefits from the recent acquisitions or any future acquisitions to the extent, or in the time frame, anticipated by us. We have incurred, and expect to continue incurring, expenses related to the integration of acquisitions. These transaction and integration expenses could, particularly in the near term, exceed the savings and synergies that we expect to achieve from the elimination of duplicative expenses and the realization of economies of scale and cost savings related to the integration of the acquired businesses following the completion of the recent acquisitions. Any of these factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAs a result of our acquisition activity, our goodwill and intangible assets have increased substantially in recent years and we have incurred, and may continue to incur, impairments to goodwill or intangible assets.\nWhen we acquire a business, a substantial portion of the purchase price of the acquisition is allocated to goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets. In accordance with applicable acquisition accounting rules, we are required to record as goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet the amount by which the purchase price exceeds the net fair value of the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired as of the acquisition date. We review our indefinite-lived intangible assets, including goodwill, for impairment annually in the fourth fiscal quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a potential impairment exists. Factors that may be considered in assessing whether goodwill or intangible assets may be impaired include a decline in our stock price or market capitalization, changes in our marketing or branding strategy, reduced estimates of future cash flows in our annual operating plan and slower growth rates in our industry.\nOur valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on a number of factors including industry experience, internal benchmarks, and the economic environment. We also rely heavily on projections of future operating performance. If our annual operating plan is not achieved or if there are other variations to our estimates and assumptions, particularly in the expected growth rates and profitability embedded in our cash flow projections or the discount rate used, there is the potential for a partial or total impairment of the carrying amount of goodwill within one or more of our reporting units.\nIn the past, we have recorded impairment charges in connection with various factors such as exiting certain markets or lines of business. Due to continual changes in market and general business conditions, we cannot predict whether, and to what extent, our goodwill and long-lived intangible assets may be impaired in future periods. Any resulting impairment loss would have a negative effect on our results of operations. See Note 7 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nWe may be unable to realize the level of benefit that we expect from our restructuring activities and cost reduction initiatives which may hurt our profitability and our business otherwise might be adversely affected.\nWe continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and seek the most cost-effective means and efficient structure to serve our customers and suppliers and respond to changes in the markets in which we operate. In line with this commitment, we have in the past and may, in the future, divest of certain non-core assets, exit lines of businesses that are not achieving the desired return on investment or generate low or highly variable economic value, or otherwise restructure certain of our operations to improve operating efficiencies, cost competitiveness and profitability. We have also engaged in various cost reduction initiatives and restructuring activities beginning in 2017 and throughout 2018 and 2019 and expect to continue to evaluate areas for additional restructuring and cost reduction opportunities, as well as potential divestitures.\nWe may not be able to achieve the level of benefit that we expect to realize from our past or future restructuring activities or divestitures. For example, we may be unable to produce returns on the reinvestment of proceeds that are greater than that of the divested activity. We may also materially alter various aspects of our business, or our business model, and we cannot provide any assurances that such changes will be successful or that they will not ultimately have a negative effect on our business and results of operations. Further, these types of restructuring activities could result in unintended consequences such as diversion of our management and employees\u2019 attention from ongoing business operations, business disruption, including as a result of any interconnectivity between our retained business and the one divested, attrition beyond any planned reduction in workforce, potential loss of key customers, inability to attract or retain key personnel and reduced employee productivity or morale, which could adversely affect our business. Finally, restructuring activities and divestitures may result in restructuring charges and material write-offs, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets, as well as ongoing indemnity obligations to purchasers, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business is subject to extensive laws and regulations pertaining to environmental protection, health, safety and security that can result in material costs and liabilities.\nOur business is subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations. A violation of, liability under, or noncompliance with these laws and regulations, or any future environmental law or regulation, could result in significant liability, including administrative, civil or criminal penalties, remediation costs for natural resource damages as well as third-party damages. Some environmental laws impose strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of oil and hazardous substances, which could subject us to liability without regard to whether we were negligent or at fault. In our marine segment we utilize fuel delivery barges and store refined products adjacent to water, thereby potentially subjecting us to strict, joint, and potentially unlimited liability for removal costs and other consequences of an oil spill where the spill is into navigable waters, along shorelines or in the exclusive economic zone of the U.S. Any of these occurrences and any resulting negative media coverage could have a material adverse effect on our stock price and on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, increasingly stringent U.S. and foreign environmental laws and regulations have resulted and will likely continue to increase our operating costs. For example, compliance with existing and future laws that regulate the delivery of fuel by barge, truck, vessel, pipeline or railcar; or fuel storage terminals or underground storage tanks that we own, lease or operate may require significant capital expenditures and increased operating and maintenance costs, particularly as we acquire businesses with more physical assets. In addition, continuing changes in environmental laws and regulations may also require capital expenditures by our customers or otherwise increase our customers\u2019 operating costs, which could in turn, reduce the demand for our products and services or impact the pricing or availability of the products we sell. Although the ultimate impact of any regulations is difficult to predict accurately, the occurrence of any of the foregoing could have an adverse effect on our business or on the businesses of our customers.\nInformation technology (\u201cIT\u201d) failures and data security breaches, including as a result of cybersecurity attacks, could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition, subject us to increased operating costs, and expose us to litigation.\nWe rely heavily on our computer systems, information technology and network infrastructure across our operations, particularly as we seek to grow our technology offerings, digitize our business and drive internal efficiencies. Despite our implementation of security and back-up measures, our technology systems are vulnerable to damage, disability or failures due to physical theft, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure, operational error, or other catastrophic events. Our technology systems, and those of third party service providers, are subject to cybersecurity attacks including malware, ransomware, computer viruses and other malicious software, social engineering attacks (such as phishing email attacks and impersonation), attempts to gain unauthorized access to our data, the unauthorized release, corruption or loss of our data, loss or damage to our data delivery systems, and other electronic security breaches. The techniques used to conduct cybersecurity attacks and breaches of IT systems, as well as the sources and targets\nof these attacks, change frequently and at times are not recognized until they have been in place for a period of time, which can exacerbate the effects of such attacks. In the event our systems and procedures for protecting against such attacks and mitigating such risks prove to be insufficient in the future, such attacks could have an adverse impact on our business and operations, including damage to our reputation and competitiveness, as well as subject us to significant remediation costs, litigation or regulatory actions, fines and penalties. In addition, as technologies evolve, and these cyber security attacks become more sophisticated, we may incur significant costs to upgrade or enhance our security measures to protect against such attacks and we may face difficulties in fully anticipating or implementing adequate preventive measures or mitigating potential harm.\nFurthermore, due to the large number of transactions that run through our systems each day, significant system downtime, slow-down or denial of service and other cyber attacks, could have a material impact on our, and in the case of our technology offerings, our customers\u2019, ability to conduct business, process and record transactions, make operational and financial decisions or damage our reputation with customers or suppliers, particularly in the event of billing errors or payment delays. While we have been increasing our use of cloud-based technology and computing platforms operated by third parties, if we are unable to continually and effectively upgrade our IT systems, our operations and our business will be negatively affected. In addition, if our use of these cloud services, or the third party service providers who operate them, is disrupted either due to system failures, or physical or electronic security breaches that lead to disruptions in our critical systems, or if the infrastructure which allows us to connect to the third party systems is interrupted, it could adversely impact our operations and our business. We also cannot guarantee that our third-party service providers will effectively protect and handle our IT systems infrastructure, which can result in disruptions to our business operations. Finally, we may not have adequate recourse against these third parties in the event they experience a cybersecurity attack or other security breach and our data is compromised.\nIn addition to our vulnerabilities, our reliance on email transmissions over public networks to process certain transactions exposes us to risks associated with the failure of our employees, customers, business partners and other third parties to use appropriate controls to protect sensitive information, as well as to risks of online fraud and email scams. External parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information to gain access to our data or use electronic means to induce us to enter into fraudulent transactions. Past and future occurrences of such attacks could damage our reputation and our ability to conduct our business, impact our credit and risk exposure decisions, cause us to lose customers or revenues, subject us to litigation and require us to incur substantial expenses to address, remediate, and/or enhance the security measures we employ to resolve these issues. Any of the foregoing, if of sufficient magnitude, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe currently maintain insurance to protect against cybersecurity risks and incidents. However, insurance coverage may not be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms or at commercially reasonable rates. In addition, insurance coverage may be insufficient or may not cover certain of these cybersecurity risks and, even if available, the insurance proceeds received for any loss or damage may be insufficient to cover our losses or liabilities without adversely affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe personal information that we collect may be vulnerable to breach, theft, loss or misuse that could increase operational costs, result in regulatory penalties and adversely affect our results of operation and financial condition.\nIn connection with various businesses we operate, including our transaction management and payment processing businesses, we have access to sensitive, confidential or personal data or information from our employees, customers (both corporate and individual consumers), suppliers and other third parties, some of which may be subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and customer-imposed controls. In the ordinary course of business, we collect, process, transmit and retain sensitive information regarding these parties. Despite our efforts to protect this information, our facilities and systems and those of our third-party service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches, theft, misplaced or lost data and programming and human errors that could potentially lead to such information being compromised.\nThere has been increased public attention regarding the use of personal information and data transfers, accompanied by legislation and regulations intended to strengthen data protection, information security and consumer and personal privacy. The law in these areas continues to develop and the changing nature of privacy laws in the U.S., the European Union (\u201cE.U.\u201d) and elsewhere could impact our processing of this sensitive, personal information, including requiring us to make costly changes to our IT systems to properly protect the information. In 2018, the E.U.\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) went into effect, which imposes strict rules on controlling and processing customer data originating from the E.U. with significant fines and sanctions for violations. We have substantial operations in the\nE.U. and are therefore subject to these heightened standards. Similarly, the State of California legislature passed the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (\u201cCCPA\u201d), effective January 1, 2020, which grants certain rights to California residents with respect to their personal information and requires companies take certain actions, including notifications for certain security incidents. As interpretation and enforcement of the CCPA evolves, it may create a range of new compliance obligations, which could cause us to change our business practices, with the possibility for significant financial penalties for noncompliance that could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe expect that there will continue to be new laws, regulations and industry standards concerning data privacy and data protection in the U.S., the EU and other jurisdictions. While we cannot yet determine the full impact such laws, regulations, and interpretations may have on our business, our failure to adequately protect personal information could lead to substantial fines, penalties, third-party liability, remediation costs, potential cancellation of existing contracts and the inability to compete for future business. We have taken steps to address the requirements of GDPR, CCPA and other data privacy regulations applicable to our operations, including implementing enhanced network security and internal control measures, however, these steps may not prevent data security breaches and any significant data security breach could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation, as well as our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur international operations subject us to a number of international trade control, anti-money laundering and anti-corruption laws, particularly from the U.S. and U.K., which can impose substantial compliance costs and subject us to civil or criminal penalties for non-compliance.\nOur global operations are subject to anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and, in certain circumstances, the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 (\u201cBribery Act\u201d), anti-money laundering laws, international trade controls, and antitrust and competition laws. The FCPA prohibits us from providing anything of value to foreign officials for the purposes of improperly influencing official decisions or improperly obtaining or retaining business. Where applicable, the Bribery Act prohibits public and commercial bribery both in the U.K. and internationally.\nAs part of our business, we regularly deal with state-owned enterprises whose employees may be considered government officials under applicable anti-corruption laws. In addition, some of the international jurisdictions in which we operate lack a developed legal system and have higher than normal levels of corruption. Our activities in these countries may increase the risk of improper payment demands made to, or offers made by, one of our employees or other parties acting on our behalf, and the rejection of demands to make such improper payments may also negatively impact our activities in those countries. The risk of enforcement has also grown beyond the U.S. and the U.K. as more and more countries that we operate in have passed laws in recent years targeting bribery and corruption and with global authorities prioritizing enforcement, resulting in significant fines and penalties\nInternational trade controls, including economic sanctions such as those administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d), export controls and anti-boycott regulations, restrict our business dealings with certain countries and individuals, are complex and continually changing. Additional restrictions may be enacted, amended, enforced or interpreted in a manner that materially impacts our operations. From time to time, certain of our subsidiaries have limited business dealings in countries subject to comprehensive OFAC administered sanctions. These business dealings currently represent an immaterial amount of our consolidated revenue and income and are undertaken pursuant to general and/or specific licenses issued by OFAC or as otherwise permitted by applicable sanctions regulations. However, as a result of the above activities, we are exposed to a heightened risk of violating trade control regulations, which could result in significant penalties.\nWe have established policies and procedures designed to assist with our compliance with these laws and regulations and maintaining and enhancing our policies and procedures in response to changing laws and regulations or business circumstances can be costly and place restrictions on our operations. Furthermore, such policies and procedures may not always prevent us, our employees, third parties or agents from violating these laws and regulations. Violations are punishable by fines and expose us and/or employees to criminal sanctions and civil suits and subject us to other adverse consequences including the denial of export privileges, injunctions, asset seizures, debarment from government contracts, revocations or restrictions of licenses. In addition, the costs associated with responding to a government investigation and remediating any violations can be substantial. Accordingly, violations could adversely affect, among other things, our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, violations could also cause an event of default under our Credit Facility, which if not waived, could result in the acceleration of any outstanding indebtedness, could trigger cross-defaults under other agreements to which we are a party (such as certain derivative contracts), and would impair our ability to obtain working capital advances and\nletters of credit. Any of the foregoing events could therefore adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business is subject to seasonal variability, which has caused our revenues and operating results to fluctuate and can adversely affect the market price of our shares.\nOur operating results are subject to seasonal variability. Seasonality results from numerous factors, including traditionally higher demand for natural gas and home heating oil during the winter months and for aviation and land fuel during the summer months, as well as other seasonal weather patterns. As such, our results for the second and third quarters of the year tend to be the strongest for our aviation segment and our results for the fourth and first quarters of the year tend to be the strongest for our land segment. However, extreme or unseasonable weather conditions can substantially reduce the demand for our products and services or significantly increase the prices of the fuel products we sell which can, in turn, adversely impact our results of operations. For example, in the first half of 2019, unseasonably warm winter weather in the U.S. and U.K. adversely impacted our results. Furthermore, we cannot provide any assurances that the seasonal variability will continue in future periods. Accordingly, results for any one quarter may not necessarily be indicative of the results that may be achieved for such quarter the following year or for the full fiscal year. These seasonal fluctuations in our quarterly operating results can therefore adversely affect the market price of our shares.\nThe U.K.\u2019s withdrawal from the E.U. could harm our business and financial results.\nWe have substantial operations in the U.K., particularly in our land segment. On June 23, 2016, the U.K. held a referendum in which British voters approved an exit from the E.U., commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d. On January 31, 2020, the U.K. finally exited the E.U. pursuant to the terms of a withdrawal agreement concluded between the U.K. government and the E.U. Council (the \u201cWithdrawal Agreement\u201d). The Withdrawal Agreement allows for a transition period through December 31, 2020, during which the U.K.\u2019s trading relationship with the E.U. will remain largely unchanged and the U.K. and the E.U. will continue to negotiate the terms of their ongoing relationship. Accordingly, uncertainty remains over the U.K.\u2019s future relationship with the E.U. after 2020.\nWe face risks associated with the potential uncertainty and consequences that may follow Brexit, including potential disruption of our supply chains and the free movement of goods, services and people between the U.K. and the E.U and adverse changes to tax benefits or liabilities in these or other jurisdictions. In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations, including with respect to certain licenses or other rights granted to us under E.U. laws, as the U.K. determines which E.U. laws to replace or replicate. Finally, concern over the implications of Brexit have caused, and may continue to cause, volatility in global stock markets, currency exchange rate fluctuations and global economic uncertainty. Any of these effects of Brexit, among others, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur derivative transactions with customers, suppliers, merchants and financial institutions expose us to price and credit risks, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAs part of our price risk management services, we offer customers various pricing structures for the purchase of fuel, including derivatives products designed to hedge exposure to fluctuations in fuel prices. In the ordinary course of business, we enter into fixed forward contracts with some of our counterparties under which we agree to sell or purchase certain volumes of fuel at fixed prices. In addition, we may act as a counterparty in over-the-counter swap transactions with some of our customers where the customer may be required to pay us in connection with changes in the price of fuel. Further, we may use derivatives to hedge price risks associated with our fuel inventories and purchase and sale commitments. We typically hedge our price risk in any of the foregoing types of transactions by entering into derivative instruments with large energy companies, trading houses and financial institutions.\nIf we have not required a customer to post collateral in connection with a fixed forward contract or swap transaction and there is an outstanding mark-to-market liability owing, we will have effectively extended unsecured credit to that customer and such amounts could be substantial. Based on the volatility of fuel prices, our counterparties may not be willing or able to fulfill their obligations to us under their fixed forward contracts or swap transactions. In such cases, we would be exposed to potential losses or costs associated with any resulting default. For example, in the event the spot market price of fuel at the time of delivery is substantially less than the fixed price of the contract with the customer, a customer could default on its purchase obligation to us and purchase the fuel at a lower \u201cspot\u201d market price from another supplier. Meanwhile, we may have entered into a corresponding commitment with a supplier to offer our customer specified fixed pricing or terms and would be obligated to perform our fixed price purchase obligations to such supplier. Similarly, the counterparties with whom we may hedge our price risk exposure may not be willing or able to fulfill their obligations to us under their swap transactions.\nWhile we monitor and manage our credit exposures to our counterparties, credit defaults may still occur and the actual recovery will depend on the financial condition of that counterparty and our ability to enforce any obligation owed to us. Accordingly, if we are unable to recover such losses from a defaulting counterparty, we could sustain substantial losses that would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFinally, our hedging activities also result in additional costs and can require cash deposits for margin calls. If there is a sudden a significant change in fuel prices, the amount of cash necessary to cover margin calls can be material and impact our liquidity.\nWe are exposed to various risks in connection with our use of derivatives which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe enter into financial derivative contracts primarily to mitigate the risk of market price fluctuations in fuel products, to offer our customers fuel pricing alternatives to meet their needs, to manage price exposures associated with our inventories, and to mitigate the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. However, our efforts to hedge our exposure to fuel price and exchange rate fluctuations may be ineffective in certain instances. For example, we hedge jet fuel prices with derivatives tied to other petroleum products that have historically been correlated to aviation jet fuel (e.g. heating oil in the U.S. or gasoil in Europe or Asia). If the price of aviation jet fuel at a specific location experiences a divergence to historical correlations, our attempts to mitigate price risk associated with our aviation business may not be effective. Moreover, there may be times where the change in the price of jet fuel at a specific location is disrupted (e.g. hurricanes) and is not correlated to the underlying hedges when compared to historical prices.\nWe may also enter into proprietary derivative transactions, which are not intended to hedge our own risk but rather make a profit by capitalizing on arbitrage opportunities associated with basis, time, quality or geographic spreads related to fuel products we sell. Proprietary derivative transactions, by their nature, expose us to changes in the underlying commodity prices of the proprietary positions taken. Although we have established limits on such exposure, any adverse changes could result in losses which can be further exacerbated by volatility in the financial and other markets. In addition, our employees may fail to comply with our policies and procedures with respect to hedging or proprietary trading, such as engaging in unauthorized trading activity, failing to hedge a specific price risk or failing to comply with our internal limits on exposure or any applicable statutory or regulatory requirements. Furthermore, the enforceability of our derivative transactions may depend on our compliance with applicable statutory, commodity and other regulatory requirements, which if violated could lead to our derivative transaction being voided. The impact of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFinally, many of our derivative transactions are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes, and therefore, changes in the fair market value of these derivatives are reflected as a component of revenue or cost of revenue (based on the underlying transaction type) in our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. Since the fair market value of these derivatives is marked to market at the end of each quarter, changes in the value of our derivative instruments as a result of gains or losses may cause our earnings to fluctuate from period to period.\nWe face intense competition and, if we are not able to effectively compete in our markets, our revenues and profits may decrease.\nCompetitive pressures in our markets could adversely affect our competitive position, leading to a possible loss of market share or a decrease in prices, either of which could result in decreased revenues and profits. Our competitors are numerous, ranging from large multinational corporations, which have significantly greater capital resources than we do, to relatively small and specialized firms. Industry developments, such as fuel price transparency, procurement technology tools, increased regulation and increasing customer sophistication may, over time, reduce demand for our services and thereby exacerbate the competition. In addition, we rely on a single or limited number of suppliers for the provision of fuel and related products and services in certain markets. These parties may have significant negotiating leverage over us, and if they are unable or unwilling to supply us on commercially reasonable terms, our business would be adversely affected.\nFinally, in addition to competing with resellers, we also compete with the major oil producers that market fuel and other energy products directly to the large commercial airlines, shipping companies and commercial and industrial users. In recent years, a low fuel price environment has caused many major oil companies to remain in or re-enter the downstream markets. Our business could be adversely affected and subject to the risk of disintermediation if our suppliers choose to increase their direct marketing to compete with us or provide less advantageous price and credit terms to us than to our fuel reseller competitors.\nOur failure to comply with the requirements of our Credit Facility and Term Loans could adversely affect our operating flexibility.\nWe have the ability to borrow money pursuant to a Credit Facility and Term Loans, which we amended on July 23, 2019, to among other things, (i) increase our borrowing capacity to $1.3 billion, (ii) increase the Term Loans to $525.0 million, (iii) modify and extend the final maturity date to July 2024, and (iv) modify certain financial and other covenants to reduce costs and provide greater operating flexibility. Our Credit Facility and Term Loans impose certain operating and financial covenants on us, which, among other things, restrict our ability to (i) pay dividends or make certain other restricted payments, (ii) incur additional debt, (iii) create liens, (iv) sell assets, and (v) engage in mergers or acquisitions. Our failure or inability to comply with the requirements of these facilities, including meeting certain financial ratios or other covenants, could limit the availability under our Credit Facility or result in an event of default. An event of default, if not cured or waived, would permit acceleration of any outstanding indebtedness under these facilities, could trigger cross-defaults under other agreements to which we are a party (such as certain derivative contracts), and would impair our ability to obtain working capital advances and letters of credit, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we are unable to retain our senior management and key employees, our business and results of operations could be harmed.\nOur ability to maintain our competitive position is largely dependent on the services of our senior management and key personnel. Although we have employment or severance agreements with certain of our key employees, these agreements do not prevent those individuals from ceasing their employment with us at any time. If we are unable to retain existing senior management and key personnel, or to attract other qualified senior management and key personnel on terms satisfactory to us, our business could be adversely affected. While we maintain key man life insurance with respect to certain members of senior management, our coverage levels may not be sufficient to offset any losses we may incur and there is no assurance that we will continue to maintain key man life insurance in the future.\nInsurance coverage for some of our operations may be insufficient to cover losses, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe maintain insurance to cover various risks associated with the operation of our business. Certain risks, however, such as environmental risks, are not fully insurable and our insurance coverage does not cover all potential losses, costs, or liabilities. Accordingly, our insurance policies may not adequately cover or may have exclusions of coverage for certain losses. Therefore, our insurance coverage may not be available or, if available, may not be adequate to cover claims that may arise.\nFurthermore, our ability to obtain and maintain adequate insurance and the cost of such insurance may be affected by significant claims and conditions in the insurance market over which we have no control. If the cost of insurance increases, we may decide to discontinue certain insurance coverage, reduce our level of coverage or increase our deductibles/retentions to offset the cost increase. In addition, our existing types and levels of insurance coverage could become difficult or impossible to obtain in the future. The occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance, the loss of insurance coverage or a material increase in the cost of insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCurrent and future litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe are currently, and may in the future be, involved in legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business. Lawsuits and other administrative or legal proceedings, as well as any governmental investigations, can involve substantial costs, including the costs associated with investigation, litigation and possible settlement, judgment, penalty or fine. Although we generally maintain insurance to mitigate certain exposures, costs associated with lawsuits or other legal proceedings may exceed the limits of insurance policies, which could adversely impact our results of operations. Furthermore, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected if a judgment, penalty or fine is not fully covered by insurance.", "PERMNO": 75070, "SIC": 5172, "TIC": "INT"}
