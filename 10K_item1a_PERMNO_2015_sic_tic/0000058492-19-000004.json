{"cik": "58492", "company": "LEGGETT & PLATT INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-02-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nInvesting in our securities involves risk. Set forth below and elsewhere in this report are risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report. We may amend or supplement these risk factors from time to time by other reports we file with the SEC.\nInability to timely integrate and fully realize the benefit of the Elite Comfort Solutions, Inc. acquisition could negatively impact our ability to achieve our anticipated cash flows, results of operations, earnings per share, and stock price.\nThe Company completed the acquisition of Elite Comfort Solutions, Inc. (ECS) for a cash purchase price of approximately $1.25 billion on January 16, 2019. However, we may not be able to successfully integrate the ECS businesses. The financial performance of ECS and the combined company following completion of the transaction may not meet expectations due to a variety of factors, some of which may be outside of our control. The integration may divert management's resources and attention from running our other businesses, and we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction, including as a result of delay in integrating ECS. Moreover, we may experience difficulties and delays in achieving revenue synergies associated with the transaction, or we may not achieve these synergies at all. Furthermore, additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of the ECS business. Finally, we may have difficulties in retaining key personnel and maintaining relationships with customers and suppliers of ECS. Our inability to successfully and timely integrate the ECS businesses could negatively impact our cash flows, results of operations, earnings per share, and stock price.\nOur credit agreement contains covenants that may limit our operational flexibility. Furthermore, if we default on our obligations under the credit agreement, our operations may be interrupted and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe entered into the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement among us, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent (\u201cJPMorgan\u201d) and twelve other lenders in our bank group (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d). The Credit Agreement is a five-year multi-currency credit facility providing us the ability, from time to time subject to certain customary conditions, to borrow, repay and re-borrow up to $1.2 billion. The Credit Agreement also provides for a one-time draw of up to $500 million under a five-year term loan facility, which we fully borrowed on January 16, 2019 to consummate the ECS acquisition. The Credit Agreement acts as support for the marketability of our commercial paper program, under which we had $898 million outstanding on January 16, 2019, the ECS acquisition closing date.\nThe Credit Agreement contains certain covenants, including a covenant that requires us to maintain, as of the last day of each quarter beginning March 31, 2019, a leverage ratio of consolidated funded indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA (each as defined in the Credit Agreement) for the trailing four fiscal quarters of not greater than 4.25 to 1.00, with a single step-down on March 31, 2020 and thereafter, to 3.50 to 1.00. This covenant may restrict our current and future operations, including (i) our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our businesses and industries; and (ii) our ability to use our cash flows, or obtain additional financing, for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes.\nAlso, if we fail to comply with the covenants specified in the Credit Agreement, we may trigger an event of default, in which case the lenders would have the right to: (i) terminate their commitment to provide additional loans under the Credit Agreement, and (ii) declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable. If the debt under the Credit Agreement were to be accelerated, we may not have sufficient cash to repay this debt, which would have an immediate material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nCosts of raw materials could negatively affect our profit margins and earnings.\nRaw material cost increases (and our ability to respond to cost increases through selling price increases) can significantly impact our earnings. We typically have short-term commitments from our suppliers; therefore, our raw material costs generally move with the market. When we experience significant increases in raw material costs, we typically implement price increases to recover the higher costs. Inability to recover cost increases (or a delay in the recovery time) can negatively impact our earnings. Conversely, if raw material costs decrease, we generally pass through reduced selling prices to our customers. Reduced selling prices combined with higher cost inventory can reduce our segment margins and earnings.\nPART I\nSteel is our principal raw material. The global steel markets are cyclical in nature and have been volatile in recent years. This volatility can result in large swings in pricing and margins from year to year. Our operations can also be impacted by changes in the cost of chemicals (including TDI, MDI, and polyol), fabrics and foam scrap, which may be subject to significant fluctuation and may negatively impact our profit margins and earnings.\nAs a producer of steel rod, we are also impacted by volatility in metal margins (the difference between the cost of steel scrap and the market price for steel rod). If market conditions cause scrap costs and rod pricing to change at different rates (both in terms of timing and amount), metal margins could be compressed and this would negatively impact our results of operations.\nHigher raw material costs could lead some of our customers to modify their product designs, changing the quantity and mix of our components in their finished goods and replacing higher cost components with lower cost components. If this were to occur, it could negatively impact our results of operations.\nCompetition could adversely affect our market share, sales, profit margins and earnings.\nWe operate in markets that are highly competitive. We believe that most companies in our lines of business compete primarily on price, but, depending upon the particular product, we experience competition based on quality and performance. We face ongoing pressure from foreign competitors as some of our customers source a portion of their components and finished products from Asia and Europe. In addition to lower labor rates, foreign competitors benefit (at times) from lower raw material costs. They may also benefit from currency factors and more lenient regulatory climates. If we are unable to purchase key raw materials, such as steel, at prices competitive with those of foreign suppliers, our ability to maintain market share, sales, profit margins and earnings could be harmed by foreign competitors.\nInterruption in our customers\u2019 businesses due to bankruptcy, financial difficulties or insolvency could result in their inability to pay their debts to us, and could adversely affect our sales, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nBankruptcy, financial difficulties or insolvency can and has occurred with some of our customers which can impact their ability to pay their debts to us. We have extended trade credit to some of these customers in a material amount, particularly in our Bedding and Consumer Products Groups. Our bad debt reserve contains uncertainties because it requires management to estimate the amount of uncollectible receivables based upon the financial health and payment history of the customer, industry and macroeconomic considerations, and historical loss experience.\nSome retailers that carry our products or our customers\u2019 products may undergo restructurings or reorganizations because of financial difficulty. Also, certain of our customers have filed bankruptcy, and others, from time to time, have become insolvent and/or do not have the ability to pay their debts to us as they come due. If our customers suffer significant financial difficulty, they may be unable to pay their debts to us, they may reject their contractual obligations to us under bankruptcy laws or otherwise, or we may have to negotiate significant discounts and/or extend financing terms with these customers.\nAny of these risks, if realized, could adversely affect our sales and increase our operating expenses by requiring larger provisions for bad debt, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nTariffs by the United States government could result in increased costs of imports and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIn 2018, the United States imposed broad-ranging tariffs of 25% on imports of steel products and 10% on imports of aluminum products. The Administration has also imposed tariffs on a broad variety of products imported from China. Additional tariffs may be imposed, or current tariffs increased, in the future. Any tariffs that result in increased costs of imported products and materials could require us to increase prices to our domestic customers or, if we are unable to do so, result in lowering our gross margins on products sold. As a result, the tariffs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe are exposed to litigation contingencies that, if realized, could have a material negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAlthough we deny liability in all currently threatened or pending litigation proceedings and believe that we have valid bases to contest all claims made against us, we have, at December 31, 2018, an aggregate litigation contingency\nPART I\naccrual of $2 million. Based on current facts and circumstances, aggregate reasonably possible (but not probable) losses in excess of the recorded accruals for litigation contingencies (which include Brazilian value-added tax and other matters) are estimated to be $17 million. If our assumptions or analysis regarding these contingencies is incorrect, or if facts and circumstances change, we could realize loss in excess of the recorded accruals (and in excess of the $17 million referenced above) which could have a material negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. For more information regarding our legal contingencies, please see Note U on page 119 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe are exposed to foreign currency risk which may negatively impact our competitiveness, profit margins and earnings.\nWe expect that international sales will continue to represent a significant percentage of our total sales, which exposes us to currency exchange rate fluctuations. In 2018, 37% of our sales were generated by international operations. Certain of our operations experience currency-related gains and losses where sales or purchases are denominated in currencies other than their local currency. Further, our competitive position may be affected by the relative strength of the currencies in countries where our products are sold. Foreign currency exchange risks inherent in doing business in foreign countries may have a material adverse effect on our competitiveness, profit margins and earnings.\nOur goodwill and other long-lived assets are subject to potential impairment which could negatively impact our earnings.\nA significant portion of our assets consists of goodwill and other long-lived assets, the carrying value of which may be reduced if we determine that those assets are impaired. At December 31, 2018, goodwill and other intangible assets represented $1.01 billion, or 30% of our total assets. In addition, net property, plant and equipment and sundry assets totaled $845 million, or 25% of total assets. After completing the ECS acquisition in January 2019, as discussed in Note V on page 121 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, our goodwill and other long-lived asset balances are expected to increase. If actual results differ from the assumptions and estimates used in the goodwill and long-lived asset valuation calculations, we could incur impairment charges, which would negatively impact our earnings.\nWe review our reporting units for potential goodwill impairment in the second quarter as part of our annual goodwill impairment testing, and more often if an event or circumstance occurs making it likely that impairment exists. In addition, we test for the recoverability of long-lived assets at year end, and more often if an event or circumstance indicates the carrying value may not be recoverable. We conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions, as well as future expectations. If we are not able to achieve projected performance levels, future impairments could be possible, which would negatively impact our earnings.\nFor more information regarding potential goodwill and other long-lived asset impairment, please refer to Note D on page 82 and Note V on page 121 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTechnology failures or cyber security breaches could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nWe rely on information systems to obtain, process, analyze and manage data, as well as to facilitate the manufacture and distribution of inventory to and from our facilities. We receive, process and ship orders, manage the billing of and collections from our customers, and manage the accounting for and payment to our vendors. Technology failures or security breaches of a new or existing infrastructure could create system disruptions or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. If this occurs, our operations could be disrupted, or we may suffer financial loss because of lost or misappropriated information. We cannot be certain that advances in criminal capabilities will not compromise our technology protecting information systems. If these systems are interrupted or damaged by these events or fail for any extended period of time, then our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to realize deferred tax assets on our balance sheet depending upon the amount and source of future taxable income.\nOur ability to realize deferred tax assets on our balance sheet is dependent upon the amount and source of future taxable income. Economic uncertainty or a reduction in the amount of taxable income or a change in the source of taxable income could impact our underlying assumptions on which valuation reserves are established and negatively affect future period earnings and balance sheets.\nPART I\nWe have exposure to economic and other factors that affect market demand for our products which may negatively impact our sales, operating cash flows and earnings.\nAs a supplier of products to a variety of industries, we are adversely affected by general economic downturns. Our operating performance is heavily influenced by market demand for our components and products. Market demand for the majority of our products is most heavily influenced by consumer confidence. To a lesser extent, market demand is impacted by other broad economic factors, including disposable income levels, employment levels, housing turnover and interest rates. All of these factors influence consumer spending on durable goods, and drive demand for our components and products. Some of these factors also influence business spending on facilities and equipment, which impacts approximately one quarter of our sales.\nDemand weakness in our markets can lead to lower sales and earnings in our businesses. Several factors, including a weak global economy, low consumer confidence, or a depressed housing market could contribute to reduced spending by consumers around the world. Short lead times in most of our markets allow for limited visibility into demand trends. If economic and market conditions deteriorate, we may experience material negative impacts on our sales, operating cash flows and earnings.\nChanges in tax laws or challenges to our tax positions could negatively impact our earnings and cash flows.\nWe are subject to the tax laws and reporting rules of the U.S. (federal, state and local) and several foreign jurisdictions. Current economic and political conditions make these tax rules (and governmental interpretation of these rules) in any jurisdiction, including the U.S., subject to significant change and uncertainty. There have been proposals, most notably by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the European Union to reform tax laws or change interpretations of existing tax rules. Some of these proposals, if adopted, could significantly impact how multinational corporations are taxed on their earnings and transactions. Although we cannot predict whether or in what form these proposals will become law, or how they might be interpreted, such changes could have a material adverse effect on our earnings and cash flows.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), resulting in significant changes to U.S. federal income tax law, including the reduction of the statutory federal income tax rate for corporations and the transition from a worldwide tax system to a modified territorial system. Although we expect TCJA will reduce our tax rate in future periods, this expectation is based on our current understanding of the legislation, the subsequent guidance which has been issued, and assumptions we have made. Recognized impacts could differ materially from current estimates based on additional analysis, any changes to our current interpretation of the legislation, actual financial results, additional regulatory guidance that might be issued, and other factors, including actions the Company may take as a result of TCJA.\nBusiness disruptions to our steel rod mill, if coupled with an inability to purchase an adequate and/or timely supply of quality steel rod from alternative sources, could have a material negative impact on our Residential Products and Industrial Products segments and Company results of operations.\nWe purchase steel scrap from third party suppliers. This scrap is converted into steel rod in our mill in Sterling, Illinois. Our steel rod mill has annual output of approximately 500,000 tons, a substantial majority of which is used by our three wire mills. Our wire mills convert the steel rod into drawn steel wire. This wire is used in the production of many of our products, including mattress innersprings.\nA disruption to the operation of, or supply of steel scrap to, our steel rod mill could require us to purchase steel rod from alternative supply sources, subject to market availability. Ongoing trade action by the Administration, along with the existence of antidumping and countervailing duty orders against multiple countries, could result in reduced market availability and/or higher cost of steel rod.\nIf we experience a disruption to our ability to produce steel rod in our mill, coupled with a reduction of adequate and/or timely supply from alternative market sources of quality steel rod, we could experience a material negative impact on our Residential Products and Industrial Products segments and the Company's results of operations.\nPART I\nOur borrowing costs and access to liquidity may be impacted by our credit ratings.\nIndependent rating agencies evaluate our credit profile on an ongoing basis and have assigned ratings for our short-term and long-term debt. With the debt financing of the ECS acquisition, one rating agency lowered our long-term debt credit rating by one notch. This agency, along with one other, also placed our long-term debt rating on negative outlook. If our credit ratings further decline, our borrowing costs could increase, including increased costs under our commercial paper program, costs and fees under our credit facility, and our access to future sources of liquidity may be adversely affected.\nWe are exposed to risks associated with operating in foreign countries that could result in cost increases, reduced profits, the inability to carry on certain foreign operations and may negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIn 2018, 37% of our sales were generated by international operations. Further, many of our businesses obtain products, components and raw materials from global suppliers. Accordingly, our business is subject to the political, regulatory, and legislative risks inherent in operating in numerous countries. These laws and regulations are complex and may change. If the foreign governments adopt or change laws or regulations, this could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Our international locations also face risks associated with operating in a foreign country. These risks include:\n\u2022\nCredit risks\n\u2022\nIncreased costs due to tariffs, customs and shipping rates\n\u2022\nPotential problems obtaining raw materials, and disruptions related to the availability of electricity and transportation during times of crisis or war\n\u2022\nInconsistent interpretation and enforcement, at times, of foreign tax laws and regulations, and capital requirements\n\u2022\nPolitical instability in certain countries\nOur Specialized Products segment, which derives roughly 84% of its trade sales from products manufactured in foreign countries, is particularly subject to the above risks. These and other foreign-related risks could result in cost increases, reduced profits, the inability to carry on certain foreign operations and other adverse effects on our business.\nThe governing trade provisions between the United States, Mexico and Canada may become less favorable to the Company resulting in increased costs, reduced competitiveness and a negative impact on our results of operations.\nOn November 30, 2018, the United States, Mexico, and Canada signed the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), the intended successor agreement to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Each country must follow its domestic procedures before the agreement can be ratified and thus take effect. To date, the U.S. Administration has not formally provided notice of intent to withdraw from the existing NAFTA, which would start a 6-month clock, pressing Congress to either ratify USMCA or allow NAFTA to terminate. There is uncertainty as to (i) whether the United States will withdraw from NAFTA, (ii) whether the USMCA will be ratified, or (iii) if the United States withdraws from NAFTA, but the USMCA is not ratified, what trade provisions will govern the relationships between the countries. If the governing trade provisions between the United States, Mexico and Canada become less favorable to the Company, this could increase our costs, reduce our competitiveness and negatively impact our results of operations.\nThe United Kingdom's potential withdrawal from the European Union could adversely affect us.\nIn June 2016, the United Kingdom (UK) held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union (EU), commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit.\u201d The ultimate effect of Brexit on us is difficult to predict, but, because we conduct business in the UK and in the EU, the results of the referendum and any withdrawal could cause disruptions and create uncertainty to our businesses, including affecting our relationships with customers and suppliers, altering tariffs and currencies, and fluctuating the value of the British Pound and the Euro relative to the U.S. Dollar. Such disruptions and uncertainties could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows from operations.\nPART I", "PERMNO": 60943, "SIC": 2510, "TIC": "LEG"}
