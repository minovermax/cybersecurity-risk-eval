{"cik": "1705873", "company": "Berry Corp (bry)", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIf any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected and we may not be able to achieve our goals. We cannot assure you that any of the events discussed in the risk factors below will not occur. Further, the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks and uncertainties we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may ultimately materially affect our business.\nIndex to Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nThe risks and uncertainties described below are among the items we have identified that could materially adversely affect our business, production, strategy, growth plans, acquisitions, hedging, reserves quantities or value, operating or capital costs, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, cash flows, our ability to meet our capital expenditure plans and other obligations and financial commitments, and our plans to return capital.\nOil, natural gas and NGL prices are volatile and directly affect our results.\nThe prices we receive for our oil, natural gas and NGL production and pay for natural gas purchases heavily influence our revenue, operating expenses, profitability, access to capital, future rate of growth and the carrying value of our properties. Prices for these commodities have, and may continue to, fluctuate widely in response to market uncertainty and to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil, natural gas and NGLs. For example, Brent crude oil contract prices ranged from $54.91 per Bbl at the beginning of 2019, to a high of $74.57 per Bbl and back to $56.23 per Bbl at the end of 2019. In California, the price we pay for fuel gas purchases is generally based on the Kern, Delivered Index, as well as the SoCal Index which were as low as $0.99 per MMBtu and as high as $22.38 per MMBtu for a short time in 2019 due to market disruptions. Prices remain volatile in 2020. The prices we receive for our production and pay for our gas purchases, and the levels of our production, depend on numerous factors beyond our control, which include the following:\n\u2022\nworldwide and regional political, regulatory, economic and social conditions impacting the global supply and demand for, and transportation costs of, oil and natural gas, including relaxation of rules against U.S. exports;\n\u2022\nmilitary action, war, sanctions and other conflicts;\n\u2022\nthe price and quantity of foreign imports of oil, particularly in California which imports from foreign countries more than half of the oil it consumes;\n\u2022\nthe impact of the U.S. dollar exchange rates on oil and expectations about future oil and gas prices;\n\u2022\nprevailing prices on local price indexes in the areas in which we operate which are affected by local market conditions and the proximity, capacity, cost and availability of gathering and transportation facilities as well as refining and processing disruptions or bottlenecks;\n\u2022\nthe level of global exploration, development and production, and resulting inventories, including the significant increase in U.S. activities over the past decade;\n\u2022\nactions of OPEC, its members and other state-controlled oil companies relating to oil price and production controls;\n\u2022\nactions of other significant producers;\n\u2022\nthe cost of exploring for, developing, producing and transporting reserves;\n\u2022\nweather conditions and natural disasters;\n\u2022\nother irregular events that impact our ability to conduct business or demand for our products, such as the coronavirus outbreak; and\n\u2022\ntechnological advances, conservation efforts and availability of alternative fuels affecting oil and gas consumption.\nLower oil prices and higher gas prices may reduce our cash flow, borrowing ability and access to capital needed to develop existing and future reserves.\nLower oil prices and higher gas prices generally reduce the quantity of our oil reserves as those reserves expected to be produced in later years, which tend to be costlier on a per unit basis, become uneconomic. Lower gas prices may also reduce our gas reserves. In addition, a portion of our PUDs may no longer meet the economic producibility criteria\nIndex to Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nunder the applicable rules or may be removed due to a lower amount of capital available to develop these projects within the SEC-mandated five-year limit.\nIn addition, oil and natural gas prices affect our drilling economics, and lower oil prices may require us to postpone or eliminate all or part of our development program, and result in the reduction of some of our proved undeveloped reserves, reducing the net present value of our proved reserves.\nOur business requires continual capital expenditures. We may be unable to fund these investments through operating cash flow or obtain any needed additional capital on satisfactory terms or at all, which could lead to a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves or production. Our capital program is also susceptible to risks, including regulatory and permitting risks, that could materially affect its implementation.\nOur industry is capital intensive. We have a 2020 capital expenditure budget of approximately $125 to $145 million. The actual amount and timing of our future capital expenditures may differ materially from our estimates as a result of, among other things, commodity prices, actual drilling results, the availability of drilling rigs and other services and equipment, the availability of permits, and our ability to obtain them in a timely manner or at all, legal and regulatory processes and other restrictions, and technological and competitive developments. A reduction or sustained decline in commodity prices from current levels may force us to reduce our capital expenditures, which would negatively impact our ability to grow production. Current and future laws and regulations may prevent us from being able to execute our drilling programs and development and optimization projects.\nWe expect to fund our capital expenditures with cash flows from our operations; however, our cash flows from operations, and access to capital should such cash flows prove inadequate, are subject to a number of variables, including:\n\u2022\nthe volume of hydrocarbons we are able to produce from existing wells;\n\u2022\nthe prices at which our production is sold and our operating expenses;\n\u2022\nthe success of our hedging program;\n\u2022\nour proved reserves, including our ability to acquire, locate and produce new reserves;\n\u2022\nour ability to borrow under the RBL Facility;\n\u2022\nand our ability to access the capital markets.\nIf our revenues or the borrowing base under the RBL Facility decrease as a result of lower oil, natural gas and NGL prices, lack of required permits and other operating difficulties, declines in reserves or for any other reason, we may have limited ability to obtain the capital necessary to sustain our operations and growth at current levels. If additional capital were needed, we may not be able to obtain debt or equity financing on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Any additional debt financing, would carry interest costs, diverting capital from our business activities, which in turn could lead to a decline in our reserves and production. If cash flows generated by our operations or available borrowings under the RBL Facility were not sufficient to meet our capital requirements, the failure to obtain additional financing could result in a curtailment of our operations relating to development of our properties. See \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nOur business is highly regulated and governmental authorities can delay or deny permits and approvals or change the requirements governing our operations, including the permitting approval process for oil and gas exploration, extraction, operations and production activities, well stimulation, enhanced production techniques and fluid injection or disposal, that could increase costs, restrict operations and delay our implementation of, or cause us to change, our business strategy and plans.\nOur operations are subject to complex and stringent federal, state, local and other laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and the exploration and development of our properties, as well as the production, transportation, marketing and sale of our products. Federal, state and local agencies may assert overlapping authority to regulate in these areas. For example, the jurisdiction, duties and enforcement authority of various state agencies have\nIndex to Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nsignificantly increased with respect to oil and natural gas activities in recent years, and these state agencies as well as certain cities and counties have significantly revised their regulations, regulatory interpretations and data collection and reporting requirements and plan to issue additional regulations of certain oil and natural gas activities in 2020. In addition, certain of these laws and regulations may apply retroactively and may impose strict or joint and several liability on us for events or conditions over which we and our predecessors had no control, without regard to fault, legality of the original activities, or ownership or control by third parties.\nSee \u201cItems 1 and 2. Business and Properties-Regulation of Health, Safety and Environmental Matters\u201d for a description of laws and regulations that affect our business. To operate in compliance with these laws and regulations, we must obtain and maintain permits, approvals and certificates from federal, state and local government authorities for a variety of activities including siting, drilling, completion, fluid injection and disposal, stimulation, operation, maintenance, transportation, marketing, site remediation, decommissioning, abandonment and water recycling and reuse. These permits are generally subject to protest, appeal or litigation, which could in certain cases delay or halt projects, production of wells and other operations. Additionally, failure to comply may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal fines and penalties and liability for noncompliance, costs of corrective action, cleanup or restoration, compensation for personal injury, property damage or other losses, and the imposition of injunctive or declaratory relief restricting or limiting our operations.\nOur operations in California are subject to numerous and stringent state, local and other laws and regulations that could delay or otherwise adversely impact our operations. For example, in 2019, new legislation expanded CalGEM\u2019s duties to include public health and safety and reducing or mitigating greenhouse gas emissions while meeting the state\u2019s energy needs, and will require CalGEM to study and prioritize controlling emissions from idle and abandoned wells, evaluate plugging and abandonment and restoration costs and associated bonding requirements. Additionally, in November 2019, the State Department of Conservation issued a press release announcing three actions by CalGEM: (1) a moratorium on approval of new high-pressure cyclic steam wells pending a study of the practice to address surface expressions experienced by certain operators; (2) review and updating of regulations regarding public health and safety near oil and natural gas operations pursuant to additional duties assigned to CalGEM by the Legislature in 2019; and (3) a performance audit of CalGEM's permitting processes for WST permits and PALs for underground injection by the State Department of Finance and an independent review and approval of the technical content of pending WST and PAL applications by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. In January 2020, CalGEM issued a formal notice to operators, including us, that they had issued restrictions imposing a moratorium to prohibit new underground oil-extraction wells from using high-pressure cyclic steaming process. Most recently, on February 24, 2020, a California Court of Appeals effectively invalidated a Kern County ordinance that streamlined the permitting process for oil and gas exploration, extraction, operations and production activities in unincorporated Kern County, until the County makes certain revisions to the Kern County EIR supporting the ordinance and recertifies it. Other state agencies, including CalGEM, have relied on the Kern County EIR to satisfy the CEQA requirements in connection with permitting and project approval decisions for oil and gas projects in unincorporated Kern County. We cannot predict how long it will take Kern County to recertify the Kern County EIR or to conduct a new EIR, either of which could ultimately result in the imposition of more onerous permit application requirements and limits on exploration and production activities. It is not yet known how Kern County will resolve this issue, or how long it will take to do so, and we cannot predict how long it will take or what the requirements and costs will be to obtain new permits and project approvals in the interim. It is also not yet known whether there will be significant delays or a pause in the issuance of new permits and approvals in unincorporated Kern County pending resolution of this issue.\nWith these regulatory changes in 2019, we have experienced delays in obtaining the permits required to develop our properties in accordance with our existing development and production plans. In late 2019 and in early 2020, we discontinued two drilling rigs and we are currently operating one rig. We are actively reviewing the UIC developments and considering the potential impacts of the Kern County Ruling, as well as our internal internal processes. As part of a contingency plan, we are preparing our internal resources to support a more time-intensive and burdensome permitting application process and the potential environmental impact review requirements to mitigate the impact to our development and production plans. If we are unable to obtain the required permits on a timely basis or at all, we may not be able to continue operating this one rig or to redeploy the other two as planned. If we are unable to employ these rigs on a timely basis, or at all, or execute our drilling program, our financial and operating results could be adversely affected.\nIndex to Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nOur operations may also be adversely affected by seasonal or permanent restrictions on drilling activities designed to protect various wildlife. Such restrictions may limit our ability to operate in protected areas and can intensify competition for drilling rigs, oilfield equipment, services, supplies and qualified personnel, which may lead to periodic shortages when drilling is allowed. Permanent restrictions imposed to protect threatened or endangered species or their habitat could prohibit drilling in certain areas or require the implementation of expensive mitigation measures.\nOur customers, including refineries and utilities, and the businesses that transport our products to customers are also highly regulated. For example, federal and state agencies have subjected or, proposed subjecting, more gas and liquid gathering lines, pipelines and storage facilities to regulations that have increased business costs and otherwise affect the demand, volatility and other aspects of the price we pay for fuel gas. Certain municipalities have enacted restrictions on the installation of natural gas appliances and infrastructure in new residential or commercial construction, which could affect the retail natural gas market for our utility customers and the demand and prices we receive for the natural gas we produce.\nCosts of compliance may increase, and operational delays or restrictions may occur as existing laws and regulations are revised or reinterpreted, or as new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations, each of which has occurred in the past. For example, our costs have recently begun to increase due to new fluid injection regulations, data requirements for permitting, and idle well decommissioning regulations. For instance, in 2019 we paid $27 million in asset retirement obligations, an increase from $8 million in 2018, largely due to the new idle well regulations and our focus on EH&S as we develop existing fields. In addition, we may experience delays, as we have in the past, due to insufficient internal processes and personnel resource constraints at regulatory agencies that impede their ability to process permits in a timely manner that aligns with our production projects.\nGovernment authorities and other organizations continue to study health, safety and environmental aspects of oil and natural gas operations, including those related to air, soil and water quality, ground movement or seismicity and natural resources. Government authorities have also adopted or proposed new or more stringent requirements for permitting, well construction and public disclosure or environmental review of, or restrictions on, oil and natural gas operations. Such requirements or associated litigation could result in potentially significant added costs to comply, delay or curtail our exploration, development, fluid injection and disposal or production activities, and preclude us from drilling, completing or stimulating wells, which could have an adverse effect on our expected production, other operations and financial condition.\nChanges to elected or appointed officials or their priorities and policies could result in different approaches to the regulation of the oil and natural gas industry. We cannot predict the actions the California governor or legislature may take with respect to the regulation of our business, the oil and natural gas industry or the state's economic, fiscal or environmental policies.\nWe may be unable to, or may choose not to, enter into sufficient fixed-price purchase or other hedging agreements to fully protect against decreasing spreads between the price of natural gas and oil on an energy equivalent basis or may otherwise be unable to obtain sufficient quantities of natural gas to conduct our steam operations economically or at desired levels, and our commodity-price risk-management activities may prevent us from fully benefiting from price increases and may expose us to other risks.\nTo develop our heavy oil in California we must economically generate steam using natural gas. We seek to reduce our exposure to the potential unavailability of, pricing increases for, and volatility in pricing of, natural gas by entering into fixed-price purchase agreements and other hedging transactions. We seek to reduce our exposure to potential price increases and volatility in pricing of oil by entering into swaps, calls and other hedging transactions. We may be unable to, or may choose not to, enter into sufficient such agreements to fully protect against decreasing spreads between the price of natural gas and oil on an energy equivalent basis or may otherwise be unable to obtain sufficient quantities of natural gas to conduct our steam operations economically or at desired levels. Our commodity-price risk-management activities may prevent us from fully benefiting from price increases. Additionally, our hedges are based on major oil and gas indexes, which may not fully reflect the prices we realize locally. Consequently, the price protection we receive may not fully offset local price declines.\nIndex to Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nAs of December 31, 2019, we have hedged crude oil production at the following approximate volumes and Brent prices: 16.7 MBbl/d at $64 per barrel in 2020, and 1.0 MBbl/d at $59 per barrel in 2021. We have also hedged gas purchases at the following approximate volumes and prices: 51.7 MMbtu/d at $2.95 per in 2020, and 1.2 MMbtu/d at $2.50 in 2021.\nOur commodity-price risk-management activities may also expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which:\n\u2022\nthe counterparties to our hedging or other price-risk management contracts fail to perform under those arrangements; and\n\u2022\nan event materially impacts oil and natural gas prices in the opposite direction of our derivative positions.\nEstimates of proved reserves and related future net cash flows are not precise. The actual quantities of our proved reserves and future net cash flows may prove to be lower than estimated.\nEstimation of reserves and related future net cash flows is a partially subjective process of estimating accumulations of oil and natural gas that includes many uncertainties. Our estimates are based on various assumptions, which may ultimately prove to be inaccurate, including:\n\u2022\nthe similarity of reservoir performance in other areas to expected performance from our assets;\n\u2022\nthe quality, quantity and interpretation of available relevant data;\n\u2022\ncommodity prices (see \u201c-Oil, natural gas and NGL prices are volatile and directly affect our results.\u201d);\n\u2022\nproduction, operating costs, taxes and costs related to GHG regulations;\n\u2022\ndevelopment costs;\n\u2022\nthe effects of government regulations; and\n\u2022\nfuture workover and asset retirement costs.\nMisunderstanding these variables, inaccurate assumptions, changed circumstances or new information could require us to make significant negative reserves revisions.\nWe currently expect improved recovery, extensions and discoveries and, potentially acquisitions, to be our main sources for reserves additions. However, factors such as the availability of capital, geology, government regulations and permits, the effectiveness of development plans and other factors could affect the source or quantity of future reserves additions. Any material inaccuracies in our reserves estimates could materially affect the net present value of our reserves, which could adversely affect our borrowing base and liquidity under the RBL Facility, as well as our results of operations.\nUnless we replace oil and natural gas reserves, our future reserves and production will decline.\nUnless we conduct successful development and exploration activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves, our proved reserves will decline as those reserves are produced. Success requires us to deploy sufficient capital to projects that are geologically and economically attractive which is subject to the capital, development, operating and regulatory risks already discussed above under the heading \u201c-Our business requires continual capital expenditures. We may be unable to fund these investments through operating cash flow or obtain any needed additional capital on satisfactory terms or at all, which could lead to a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves or production. Our capital program is also susceptible to risks, including regulatory and permitting risks, that could materially affect its implementation.\u201d Over the long-term, a continuing decline in our production and reserves would reduce our liquidity and ability to satisfy our debt obligations by reducing our cash flow from operations and the value of our assets.\nIndex to Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nDrilling for and producing oil and natural gas are high risk activities with many uncertainties that could adversely affect our business.\nThe success of our development, production and acquisition activities are subject to numerous risks beyond our control, including the risk that drilling will not result in commercially viable production or may result in a downward revision of our estimated proved reserves due to:\n\u2022\npoor production response;\n\u2022\nineffective application of recovery techniques;\n\u2022\nincreased costs of drilling, completing, stimulating, equipping, operating, maintaining and abandoning wells;\n\u2022\ndelays or cost overruns caused by equipment failures, accidents, environmental hazards, adverse weather conditions, permitting or construction delays, title disputes, surface access disputes and other matters; and\n\u2022\nmisinterpretation of geophysical and geological analyses, production data and engineering studies.\nAdditional factors may delay or cancel our operations, including:\n\u2022\ndelays due to regulatory requirements and procedures, including unavailability or other restrictions limiting permits and limitations on water disposal, emission of GHGs, steam injection and well stimulation, such as California\u2019s recent limitations on cyclic steaming above the fracture gradient;\n\u2022\npressure or irregularities in geological formations;\n\u2022\nshortages of or delays in obtaining equipment, qualified personnel or supplies including water for steam used in production or pressure maintenance;\n\u2022\ndelays in access to production or pipeline transmission facilities; and\n\u2022\npower outages imposed by utilities which provide a portion of our electricity needs in order to avoid fire hazards and inspect lines in connection with seasonal strong winds, have begun to occur recently and may impact our operations.\nAny of these risks can cause substantial losses, including personal injury or loss of life, damage to property, reserves and equipment, pollution, environmental contamination and regulatory penalties.\nWe may not drill our identified sites at the times we scheduled or at all.\nWe have specifically identified locations for drilling over the next several years, which represent a significant part of our long-term growth strategy. Our actual drilling activities may materially differ from those presently identified. Legislative and regulatory developments, such as the California moratorium on approval of new high-pressure cyclic steam wells pending a study of the practice to address surface expressions experienced by certain operators, could prevent us from planned drilling activities. Additionally, as we experienced late in the fourth quarter and continuing to date, new regulations and legislative activity could result in a significant decline in the permits required to develop our properties in accordance with our plans. If future drilling results in these projects do not establish sufficient reserves to achieve an economic return, we may curtail drilling or development of these projects. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee that these prospective drilling locations or any other drilling locations we have identified will ever be drilled or if we will be able to economically produce oil or natural gas from these drilling locations. In addition, some of our leases could expire if we do not establish production in the leased acreage. The combined net acreage covered by leases expiring in the next three years represented approximately 13% of our total net acreage at December 31, 2019.\nIndex to Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nPotential future legislation may generally affect the taxation of natural gas and oil exploration and development companies and may adversely affect our operations.\nIn past years, federal and state level legislation has been proposed that would, if enacted into law, make significant changes to tax laws, including to certain key U.S. federal and state income tax provisions currently available to natural gas and oil exploration and development companies.\nFor example, in California, there have been proposals for new taxes on profits that might have a negative impact on us. Although the proposals have not become law, campaigns by various special interest groups could lead to future additional oil and natural gas severance or other taxes. The imposition of such taxes could significantly reduce our profit margins and cash flow and otherwise significantly increase our costs.\nCompetition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense, making it more difficult for us to acquire properties, market oil or natural gas and secure trained personnel.\nOur future success will depend on our ability to evaluate, select and acquire suitable properties, market our production and secure skilled personnel to operate our assets in a highly competitive environment. Also, there is substantial competition for capital available for investment in the oil and natural gas industry. Many of our competitors possess and employ greater financial, technical and personnel resources than we do.\nWe may be unable to make attractive acquisitions or successfully integrate acquired businesses or assets or enter into attractive joint ventures, and any inability to do so may disrupt our business and hinder our ability to grow.\nThere is no guarantee we will be able to identify or complete attractive acquisitions. Our capital expenditure budget for 2020 does not allocate any amounts for acquisitions of oil and natural gas properties. If we make acquisitions, we would need to use cash flows or seek additional capital, both of which are subject to uncertainties discussed in this section. Competition may also increase the cost of, or cause us to refrain from, completing acquisitions. Our debt arrangements impose certain limitations on our ability to enter into mergers or combination transactions and to incur certain indebtedness. See \u201c-Our existing debt agreements have restrictive covenants that could limit our growth, financial flexibility and our ability to engage in certain activities.\u201d In addition, the success of completed acquisitions will depend on our ability to integrate effectively the acquired business into our existing operations, may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our managerial and financial resources.\nWe are dependent on our cogeneration facilities to produce steam for our operations. Contracts for the sale of surplus electricity, economic market prices and regulatory conditions affect the economic value of these facilities to our operations.\nWe are dependent on five cogeneration facilities that, combined, provide approximately 22% of our steam capacity and approximately 48% of our field electricity needs in California at a discount to market rates. To further offset our costs, we sell surplus power to California utility companies produced by three of our cogeneration facilities under long-term contracts. Should we lose, be unable to renew on favorable terms, or be unable to replace such contracts, we may be unable to realize the cost offset currently received. Our ability to benefit from these facilities is also affected by our ability to consistently generate surplus electricity and fluctuations in commodity prices. For example, during 2019 electricity sales decreased by $6 million, or 17%, due to lower unit sales resulting from unexpected downtime at our largest cogen during the summer when we receive peak pricing, and lower year-over-year gas pricing. Furthermore, market fluctuations in electricity prices and regulatory changes in California could adversely affect the economics of our cogeneration facilities and any corresponding increase in the price of steam could significantly impact our operating costs. If we were unable to find new or replacement steam sources, lose existing sources or experience installation delays, we may be unable to maximize production from our heavy oil assets. If we were to lose our electricity sources, we would be subject to the electricity rates we could negotiate. For a more detailed discussion of our electricity sales contracts, see \u201cItems 1 and 2. Business and Properties-Operational Overview-Electricity.\u201d\nIndex to Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nOur existing debt agreements have restrictive covenants that could limit our growth, financial flexibility and our ability to engage in certain activities. In addition, the borrowing base under the RBL Facility is subject to periodic redeterminations and our lenders could reduce capital available to us for investment.\nThe RBL Facility and the indenture governing our 2026 Notes have restrictive covenants that could limit our growth, financial flexibility and our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests. Failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our indebtedness. The amount available to be borrowed under the RBL Facility is subject to a borrowing base, which will be redetermined semiannually and will depend on the estimated volumes and cash flows of our proved oil and natural gas reserves and other information deemed relevant by the administrative agent of, or two-thirds of the lenders under, the RBL facility. Reduction of our borrowing base under the RBL Facility could reduce the capital available to us for investment in our business. For details regarding the terms of the RBL Facility and our 2026 Notes, see \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\".\nThese agreements contain covenants, that, among other things, limit our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue certain types of preferred stock;\n\u2022\npay dividends on capital stock or redeem, repurchase or retire our capital stock or subordinated indebtedness;\n\u2022\ntransfer, sell or dispose of assets;\n\u2022\nmake investments;\n\u2022\ncreate certain liens securing indebtedness;\n\u2022\nenter into agreements that restrict dividends or other payments from our restricted subsidiaries to us;\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022\nhedge future production or interest rates;\n\u2022\nrepay or prepay certain indebtedness prior to the due date;\n\u2022\nengage in transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022\nengage in certain other transactions without the prior consent of the lenders.\nIn addition, the RBL Facility requires us to maintain certain financial ratios or to reduce our indebtedness if we are unable to comply with such ratios, which may limit our ability to borrow funds to withstand a future downturn in our business, or to otherwise conduct necessary corporate activities. We may also be prevented from taking advantage of business opportunities that arise because of these limitations.\nOur failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our indebtedness. If that occurs, we may not be able to make all of the required payments or borrow sufficient funds to refinance such indebtedness. Even if new financing were available at that time, it may not be on terms that are acceptable to us.\nThe amount available to be borrowed under the RBL Facility is subject to a borrowing base and will be redetermined semiannually and will depend on the estimated volumes and cash flows of our proved oil and natural gas reserves and other information deemed relevant by the administrative agent of, or two-thirds of the lenders under, the RBL Facility. We, the administrative agent and lenders, each may request one additional redetermination between each regularly scheduled redetermination. Furthermore, our borrowing base is subject to automatic reductions due to certain asset sales and hedge terminations, the incurrence of certain other debt and other events as provided in the RBL Facility. For example, the RBL Facility currently provides that to the extent we incur certain unsecured indebtedness, our borrowing base will be reduced by an amount equal to 25% of the amount of such unsecured debt that exceeds the amount, if any, of certain other debt that is being refinanced by such unsecured debt. We could be required to repay a portion of the RBL Facility to the extent that after a redetermination our outstanding borrowings at such time exceed the redetermined\nIndex to Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nborrowing base. Currently, we have elected to limit the amount we can borrow under the RBL Facility to an amount well below our borrowing base.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our debt arrangements, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations, including the RBL Facility and our 2026 Notes, depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and certain financial, business and other factors that may be beyond our control. If oil and natural gas prices were to deteriorate and remain at low levels for an extended period of time, our cash flows from operating activities may be insufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness. In the absence of sufficient cash flows and capital resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet debt service and other obligations. The RBL Facility and our 2026 Notes currently restrict our ability to dispose of assets and our use of the proceeds from any such disposition. We may not be able to consummate dispositions, and the proceeds of any such disposition may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due.\nDeclines in commodity prices, changes in expected capital development, increases in operating costs or adverse changes in well performance may result in write-downs of the carrying amounts of our assets.\nWe evaluate the impairment of our oil and natural gas properties whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Based on specific market factors and circumstances at the time of prospective impairment reviews, and the continuing evaluation of development plans, production data, economics and other factors, we may be required to write down the carrying value of our properties. A write down constitutes a non-cash charge to earnings. For example, for the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded an impairment charge of $51 million for the Piceance gas properties in Colorado.\nWe have significant concentrations of credit risk with our customers and the inability of one or more of our customers to meet their obligations or the loss of any one of our major oil and natural gas purchasers may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have significant concentrations of credit risk with the purchasers of our oil and natural gas. For the year ended December 31, 2019, sales to Andeavor, Phillips 66 and Kern Oil & Refining accounted for approximately 36%, 24% and 13%, respectively, of our sales. This concentration may impact our overall credit risk because our customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions or commodity price fluctuations. We do not require our customers to post collateral. If the purchasers of our oil and natural gas become insolvent, we may be unable to collect amounts owed to us. Also, if we were to lose any one of our major customers, the loss could cause us to cease or delay both production and sale of our oil and natural gas in the area supplying that customer.\nDue to the terms of supply agreements with our customers, we may not know that a customer is unable to make payment to us until almost two months after production has been delivered. We do not require our customers to post collateral to protect our ability to be paid.\nOur producing properties are located primarily in California, making us vulnerable to risks associated with having operations concentrated in this geographic area.\nWe operate primarily in California. This geographic concentration disproportionately affects the success and profitability of our operations exposing us to local price fluctuations, changes in state or regional laws and regulations, political risks, limited acquisition opportunities where we have the most operating experience and infrastructure, limited storage options, drought conditions, and other regional supply and demand factors, including gathering, pipeline and transportation capacity constraints, limited potential customers, infrastructure capacity and availability of rigs, equipment, oil field services, supplies and labor. We discuss such specific risks in more detail elsewhere in this section.\nIndex to Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nMany of our operations are currently conducted in locations in California that may be at risk of damage from fire, mudslides, earthquakes or other natural disasters.\nWe currently conduct operations in California near known wildfire and mudslide areas and earthquake fault zones. A future natural disaster, such as a fire, mudslide or an earthquake, could cause substantial delays in our operations, damage or destroy equipment, prevent or delay transport of our products and cause us to incur additional expenses, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our facilities would be difficult to replace and would require substantial lead time to repair or replace. These events could occur with greater frequency as a result of the potential impacts from climate change. The insurance we maintain against earthquakes, mudslides, fires and other natural disasters would not be adequate to cover a total loss of our facilities, may not be adequate to cover our losses in any particular case and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.\nOperational issues and inability or unwillingness of third parties to provide sufficient facilities and services to us on commercially reasonable terms or otherwise could restrict access to markets for the commodities we produce.\nOur ability to market our production of oil, gas and NGLs depends on a number of factors, including the proximity of production fields to pipelines, refineries and terminal facilities, competition for capacity on such facilities, damage, shutdowns and turnarounds at such facilities and their ability to gather, transport or process our production. If these facilities are unavailable to us on commercially reasonable terms or otherwise, we could be forced to shut in some production or delay or discontinue drilling plans and commercial production following a discovery of hydrocarbons. We rely, and expect to rely in the future, on third party facilities for services such as storage, processing and transmission of our production. Our plans to develop and sell our reserves could be materially and adversely affected by the inability or unwillingness of third parties to provide sufficient facilities and services to us on commercially reasonable terms or otherwise. If our access to markets for commodities we produce is restricted, our costs could increase and our expected production growth may be impaired.\nDerivatives legislation and regulations could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the risks associated with our business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in 2010, establishes federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter (\u201cOTC\u201d) derivatives market and entities, like us, that participate in that market. Rules and regulations applicable to OTC derivatives transactions, and these rules may affect both the size of positions that we may hold and the ability or willingness of counterparties to trade opposite us, potentially increasing costs for transactions. Moreover, such changes could materially reduce our hedging opportunities which could adversely affect our revenues and cash flow during periods of low commodity prices. While many Dodd-Frank Act regulations are already in effect, the rulemaking and implementation process is ongoing, and the ultimate effect of the adopted rules and regulations and any future rules and regulations on our business remains uncertain.\nIn addition, the European Union and other non-U.S. jurisdictions are implementing regulations with respect to the derivatives market. To the extent we transact with counterparties in foreign jurisdictions or counterparties with other businesses that subject them to regulation in foreign jurisdictions, we may become subject to, or otherwise be affected by, such regulations. Even though certain of the European Union implementing regulations have become effective, the ultimate effect on our business of the European Union implementing regulations (including future implementing rules and regulations) remains uncertain.\nOur operations are subject to a series of risks arising out of the threat of climate change that could result in increased operating costs, limit the areas in which we may conduct oil and natural gas exploration and production activities, and reduce demand for the oil and natural gas we produce.\nThe threat of climate change continues to attract considerable attention in the United States and in foreign countries. Numerous proposals have been made and could continue to be made at the international, national, regional and state levels of government to monitor and limit existing emissions of GHGs as well as to restrict or eliminate such future emissions. As a result, our oil and natural gas exploration and production operations are subject to a series of regulatory,\nIndex to Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\npolitical, litigation, and financial risks associated with the production and processing of fossil fuels and emission of GHGs.\nIn the United States, no comprehensive climate change legislation has been implemented at the federal level. However, with the U.S. Supreme Court finding that GHG emissions constitute a pollutant under the CAA, the EPA has adopted rules that, among other things, establish construction and operating permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources, require the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from certain petroleum and natural gas system sources in the United States, implement New Source Performance Standards directing the reduction of methane from certain new, modified, or reconstructed facilities in the oil and natural gas sector, and together with the DOT, implement GHG emissions limits on vehicles manufactured for operation in the United States.\nAdditionally, various states and groups of states have adopted or are considering adopting legislation, regulations or other regulatory initiatives that are focused on such areas as GHG cap and trade programs, carbon taxes, reporting and tracking programs, and restriction of emissions. For example, California, through the CARB has implemented a cap and trade program for GHG emissions that sets a statewide maximum limit on covered GHG emissions, and this cap declines annually to reach 40% below 1990 levels by 2030. Covered entities must either reduce their GHG emissions or purchase allowances to account for such emissions. Separately, California has implemented LCFS and associated tradable credits that require a progressively lower carbon intensity of the state's fuel supply than baseline gasoline and diesel fuels. CARB has also promulgated regulations regarding monitoring, leak detection, repair and reporting of methane emissions from both existing and new oil and gas production facilities. Similar regulations applicable to oil and gas facilities have been promulgated in Colorado.\nIn September 2018, California adopted a law committing California , the fifth largest economy in the world, to the use of 100% zero-carbon electricity by 2045, and the Governor of California also signed an executive order committing California to total economy-wide carbon neutrality by 2045. We cannot predict how these various laws, regulations and orders may ultimately affect our operations. However, these initiatives could result in decreased demand for the oil, natural gas, and NGLs that we produce, and therefore adversely effect our revenues and results of operations.\nAt the international level, there is a non-binding agreement, the United Nations-sponsored \u201cParis Agreement,\u201d for nations to limit their GHG emissions through individually-determined reduction goals every five years after 2020. Although the United States has announced its withdrawal from such agreement, effective November 4, 2020, several U.S. states and local governments have announced their intention to adhere to the goals of the Paris Agreement.\nGovernmental, scientific, and public concern over the threat of climate change arising from GHG emissions has resulted in increasing political risks in the United States, including climate change related pledges made by certain candidates seeking the office of the President of the United States in 2020. Two critical declarations made by one or more candidates running for the Democratic nomination for President include threats to take actions banning hydraulic fracturing of oil and natural gas wells and banning new leases for production of minerals on federal properties. Our operations involve the use of hydraulic fracturing activities and we also have operations on federal lands under the jurisdiction of the BLM. Other actions that could be pursued by presidential candidates may include more restrictive requirements for the establishment of pipeline infrastructure or the permitting of LNG export facilities, as well as the reversal of the United States\u2019 withdrawal from the Paris Agreement in November 2020.\nLitigation risks are also increasing, as a number of cities and other local governments have sought to bring suit against the largest oil and natural gas exploration and production companies in state or federal court, alleging, among other things, that such companies created public nuisances by producing fuels that contributed to global warming effects, such as rising sea levels, and therefore are responsible for roadway and infrastructure damages as a result, or alleging that the companies have been aware of the adverse effects of climate change for some time but withheld material information from their investors by failing to adequately disclose those impacts.\nThere are also increasing financial risks for fossil fuel producers as shareholders currently invested in fossil-fuel energy companies concerned about the potential effects of climate change may elect in the future to shift some or all of their investments into non-energy related sectors. Institutional lenders who provide financing to fossil-fuel energy companies also have become more attentive to sustainable lending practices and some of them may elect not to provide\nIndex to Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nfunding for fossil fuel energy companies. Additionally, the lending practices of institutional lenders have been the subject of intensive lobbying efforts in recent years by environmental activists, proponents of the international Paris Agreement, and other groups concerned about climate change to restrict fossil fuel producers\u2019 access to capital. Limitation of investments in and financings for fossil fuel energy companies could result in the restriction, delay or cancellation of drilling programs or development or production activities.\nThe adoption and implementation of new or more stringent international, federal or state legislation, regulations or other regulatory initiatives that impose more stringent standards for GHG emissions from oil and natural gas producers such as ourselves or otherwise restrict the areas in which we may produce oil and natural gas or generate GHG emissions could result in increased costs of compliance or costs of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for or erode value for, the oil and natural gas that we produce. Additionally, political, litigation, and financial risks may result in our restricting or canceling oil and natural gas production activities, incurring liability for infrastructure damages as a result of climatic changes, or impairing our ability to continue to operate in an economic manner. Moreover, there are increasing risks to operations resulting from the potential physical impacts of climate change, such as drought, wildfires, damage to infrastructure and resources from flooding and other natural disasters and other physical disruptions. One or more of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nWe may incur substantial losses and be subject to substantial liability claims as a result of catastrophic events. We may not be insured for, or our insurance may be inadequate to protect us against, these risks.\nWe are not fully insured against all risks. Our oil and natural gas exploration and production activities, are subject to risks such as fires, explosions, oil and natural gas leaks, oil spills, pipeline and tank ruptures and unauthorized discharges of brine, well stimulation and completion fluids, toxic gases or other pollutants into the surface and subsurface environment, equipment failures and industrial accidents. We are exposed to similar risks indirectly through our customers and other market participants such as refiners. Other catastrophic events such as earthquakes, floods, mudslides, fires, droughts, contagious diseases, terrorist attacks and other events that cause operations to cease or be curtailed may adversely affect our business and the communities in which we operate. For example, utilities have begun to suspend electric services to avoid wildfires during windy periods in California, a risk that is not insured. We may be unable to obtain, or may elect not to obtain, insurance for certain risks if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented.\nWe may be involved in legal proceedings that could result in substantial liabilities.\nLike many oil and natural gas companies, we are from time to time involved in various legal and other proceedings, such as title, royalty or contractual disputes, regulatory compliance matters and personal injury or property damage matters, in the ordinary course of our business. Such legal proceedings are inherently uncertain and their results cannot be predicted. Regardless of the outcome, such proceedings could have a material adverse impact on us because of legal costs, diversion of the attention of management and other personnel and other factors. In addition, resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in liability, loss of contractual or other rights, penalties or sanctions, as well as judgments, consent decrees or orders requiring a change in our business practices. Accruals for such liability, penalties or sanctions may be insufficient, and judgments and estimates to determine accruals or range of losses related to legal and other proceedings could change materially from one period to the next.\nThe loss of senior management or technical personnel could adversely affect operations.\nWe depend on, and could be deprived of, the services of our senior management and technical personnel. We do not maintain, nor do we plan to obtain, any insurance against the loss of services of any of these individuals.\nInformation technology failures and cyberattacks could affect us significantly.\nWe rely on electronic systems and networks to communicate, control and manage our operations and prepare our financial management and reporting information. Without accurate data from and access to these systems and networks, our ability to communicate and control and manage our business could be adversely affected.\nIndex to Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nWe face various security threats, including cybersecurity threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to render data or systems unusable, threats to the security of our facilities and infrastructure or third-party facilities and infrastructure, such as processing plants and pipelines, and threats from terrorist acts. Our implementation of various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate security threats and to increase security for our information, facilities and infrastructure may result in increased capital and operating costs. Moreover, there can be no assurance that such procedures and controls will be sufficient to prevent security breaches from occurring. If security breaches were to occur, they could lead to losses of sensitive information, critical infrastructure or capabilities essential to our operations. If we were to experience an attack and our security measures failed, the potential consequences to our business and the communities in which we operate could be significant and could harm our reputation and lead to financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability.\nRisks Related to our Capital Stock\nThere may be circumstances in which the interests of our significant stockholders could be in conflict with the interests of our other stockholders.\nA large portion of our common stock is beneficially owned by a relatively small number of stockholders. Circumstances may arise in which these stockholders may have an interest in pursuing or preventing acquisitions, divestitures, hostile takeovers or other transactions, including the payment of dividends or the issuance of additional equity or debt, that, in their judgment, could enhance their investment in us or in another company in which they invest. Such transactions might adversely affect us or other holders of our common stock. In addition, our significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock because investors may perceive disadvantages in owning shares in companies with significant stockholder concentrations.\nOur significant stockholders and their affiliates are not limited in their ability to compete with us, and the corporate opportunity provisions in the Certificate of Incorporation could enable our significant stockholders to benefit from corporate opportunities that might otherwise be available to us.\nOur governing documents provide that our stockholders and their affiliates are not restricted from owning assets or engaging in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. In particular, subject to the limitations of applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation, among other things:\n\u2022\npermits stockholders to make investments in competing businesses; and\n\u2022\nprovides that if one of our directors who is also an employee, officer or director of a stockholder (a \u201cDual Role Person\u201d), becomes aware of a potential business opportunity, transaction or other matter, they will have no duty to communicate or offer that opportunity to us.\nOur director who is a Dual Role Person may become aware, from time to time, of certain business opportunities (such as acquisition opportunities) and may direct such opportunities to other businesses in which our stockholders have invested, in which case we may not become aware of, or otherwise have the ability to pursue, such opportunity. Further, such businesses may choose to compete with us for these opportunities, possibly causing these opportunities to be unavailable to us or causing them to be more expensive for us to pursue.\nFuture sales of our common stock in the public market could reduce our stock price, and any additional capital raised by us through the sale of equity or convertible securities may dilute your ownership in us.\nCertain of our largest stockholders comprised creditors of Berry LLC prior to the Chapter 11 Proceedings and we cannot predict when or whether they will sell their shares of common stock. Future sales, or concerns about them, may put downward pressure on the market price of our common stock\nWe may sell or otherwise issue additional shares of common stock or securities convertible into shares of our common stock. Berry Corp.'s Certificate of Incorporation provides for authorized capital stock consisting of 750,000,000\nIndex to Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nshares of common stock and 250,000,000 shares of preferred stock. In addition, we registered shares of the great majority of our common stock for resale. For more information see Exhibit 4.4 to our Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe issuance of any securities for acquisitions, financing, upon conversion or exercise of convertible securities, or otherwise may result in a reduction of the book value and market price of our outstanding common stock. If we issue any such additional securities, the issuance will cause a reduction in the proportionate ownership and voting power of all current stockholders. We cannot predict the size of any future issuances of our common stock or securities convertible into common stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of shares of our common stock will have on the market price of our common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock (including shares issued in connection with an acquisition), or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock.\nShares of our common stock are also reserved for issuance as equity-based awards to employees, directors and certain other persons under the second amended and restated 2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan (our \u201cOmnibus Plan\u201d). We have filed a registration statement with the SEC on Form S-8 providing for the registration of shares of our common stock issued or reserved for issuance under our Omnibus Plan. Subject to the satisfaction of vesting conditions, the expiration of certain lock-up agreements and the requirements of Rule 144, shares registered under the registration statement on Form S-8 may be made available for resale immediately in the public market without restriction. Investors may experience dilution in the value of their investment upon the exercise of any equity awards that may be granted or issued pursuant to the Omnibus Plan in the future.\nThe payment of dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors.\nWhile we have regularly declared a quarterly dividend since our July IPO, including a dividend of $0.12 per share for the first quarter of 2020, and we currently intend to continue to pay a dividend , the payment and amount of future dividend payments, if any, are subject to declaration by our Board of Directors. Such payments will depend on various factors, including actual results of operations, liquidity and financial condition, net cash provided by operating activities, restrictions imposed by applicable law, our taxable income, our operating expenses and other factors our board of directors deems relevant. Covenants contained in our RBL Facility and the indentures governing our 2026 Notes could limit the payment of dividends. We are under no obligation to make dividend payments on our common stock and may cease such payments at any time in the future.\nWe may issue preferred stock whose terms could adversely affect the voting power or value of our common stock.\nThe Certificate of Incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designations, preferences, limitations and relative rights, including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our board of directors may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could adversely impact the voting power or value of our common stock. For example, we might grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we might assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of our common stock.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and are able take advantage of reduced disclosure requirements applicable to \u201cemerging growth companies,\u201d which could make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and, for as long as we continue to be an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements, including auditor attestation requirements or any new requirements adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the \u201cPCAOB\u201d) requiring mandatory audit firm rotation, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We could be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1.07 billion, (ii) as of the end of the fiscal year that we become a\nIndex to Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\n\u201clarge accelerated filer\u201d as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three-year period.\nWe intend to take advantage of the reduced reporting requirements and exemptions, including the longer phase-in periods for the adoption of new or revised financial accounting standards which lasts until those standards apply to private companies or we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company. Our election to use the phase-in periods permitted by this election may make it difficult to compare our financial statements to those companies who will comply with new or revised financial accounting standards. If we were to subsequently elect instead to comply with these public company effective dates, such election would be irrevocable.\nTo the extent investors find our common stock less attractive as a result of our reduced reporting and exemptions, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock, and our stock price may be more volatile.\nOur internal control over financial reporting is not currently required to meet all of the standards required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, but failure to achieve and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business and share price.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires us to provide annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. However, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act until we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d which could be up to five years from our IPO.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports, safeguard our assets, and prevent fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports, safeguard our assets or prevent fraud, our reputation and operating results could be harmed. The rules governing the standards that must be met for our management to assess our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation.\nWe may encounter problems or delays in completing the implementation of effective internal controls. Further, failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could have a material adverse effect on our business and share price and could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely.\nCertain provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, may make it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of our board of directors and may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that some stockholders may consider beneficial.\nCertain provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control if our board of directors determines that such changes in control are not in the best interests of us and our stockholders. For more information see Exhibit 4.4 to our Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFor example, the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws include provisions that (i) authorize our board of directors to issue \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms, including preferences and voting rights, of those shares without stockholder approval and (ii) establish advance notice procedures for nominating directors or presenting matters at stockholder meetings.\nThese provisions could enable the board of directors to delay or prevent a transaction that some, or a majority, of the stockholders may believe to be in their best interests and, in that case, may discourage or prevent attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors. These provisions may also discourage or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management.\nIndex to Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nOur Certificate of Incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us, our directors, officers or employees arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our Certificate of Incorporation or our Bylaws or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us, our directors, officers or employees that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in each such case subject to such Court of Chancery having subject matter jurisdiction and personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants therein. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and such persons. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions.\nChanges in the method of determining London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d), or the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate, may adversely affect interest expense related to outstanding debt.\nAmounts drawn under the RBL Facility may bear interest rates in relation to LIBOR, depending on our selection of repayment options. On July 27, 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority in the U.K. announced that it would phase out LIBOR as a benchmark by the end of 2021. It is unclear whether new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021. If LIBOR ceases to exist, we may need to renegotiate the RBL Facility and may not be able to do so with terms that are favorable to us. The overall financial market may be disrupted as a result of the phase-out or replacement of LIBOR.", "PERMNO": 17956, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "BRY"}
