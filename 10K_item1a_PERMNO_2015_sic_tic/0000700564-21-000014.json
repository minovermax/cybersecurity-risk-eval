{"cik": "700564", "company": "FULTON FINANCIAL CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in the Corporation's securities involves certain risks, including, among others, the risks described below. In addition to the other information contained in this report, you should carefully consider the following risk factors.\nECONOMIC AND CREDIT RISKS.\nDifficult conditions in the economy and the financial markets may materially adversely affect the Corporation's business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Corporation's results of operations and financial condition are affected by conditions in the economy and the financial markets generally. The Corporation's financial performance is highly dependent upon the business environment in the markets where the Corporation operates and in the United States as a whole. Unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by: declines in economic growth, business activity or investor or business confidence; limitations on the availability, or increases in the cost, of credit and capital; changes in the rate of inflation or in interest rates; high unemployment; governmental fiscal and monetary policies; the level of, or changes in, prices of raw materials, goods or commodities; global economic conditions; trade policies and tariffs affecting other countries as well as retaliatory policies and tariffs by such countries; geopolitical events; natural disasters; public health crises, such as epidemics and pandemics; acts of war or terrorism; or a combination of these or other factors.\nSpecifically, the business environment impacts the ability of borrowers to pay interest on, and repay principal of, outstanding loans and the value of collateral, if any, securing those loans, as well as demand for loans and other products and services the Corporation offers. There continues to be significant ongoing financial risk facing the U.S. economy, which could negatively impact the quality of the Corporation's loan portfolio. As a result, the Corporation may have to increase its provision for credit losses, which would negatively impact its results of operations, and could result in charge-offs of a higher percentage of its loans. Unlike large, national institutions, the Corporation is not able to spread the risks of unfavorable local economic conditions across a large number of diversified economies and geographic locations. If the communities in which the Corporation operates do not grow, or if prevailing economic conditions locally or nationally are unfavorable, its business could be adversely affected. In addition, increased market competition in a lower demand environment could adversely affect the profit potential of the Corporation.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected, and will likely continue to adversely affect, the Corporation\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition for an indefinite period.\nBeginning in the first quarter of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused substantial disruptions in economic and social activity, both globally and in the United States. The spread of COVID-19, and related governmental actions to mandate or encourage temporary closures of businesses, quarantines, social distancing, \"stay at home\" orders and other restrictions on in-person operations and activities, have caused severe disruptions in the U.S. economy, which has, in turn, disrupted, and will likely continue to disrupt, the business, activities, and operations of the Corporation\u2019s customers, as well as the Corporation\u2019s own business and operations. The resulting impacts of the pandemic on consumers, including high levels of unemployment, have continued to cause changes in consumer and business spending, borrowing needs and saving habits, which have and will likely continue to affect the demand for loans and other products and services the Corporation offers, as well as the creditworthiness of its borrowers and guarantors. The significant decrease in commercial activity and disruptions in supply chains associated with the pandemic, both nationally and in the Corporation\u2019s markets, may cause customers, vendors and counterparties to be unable to meet existing payment or other obligations to the Corporation. While portions of the national economy have reopened, there is still significant uncertainty concerning the breadth and duration of business disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as their impact on the U.S. economy. The extent to which the pandemic impacts the Corporation\u2019s results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the continuing severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, whether there are additional outbreaks of COVID-19, and the actions taken to contain it or treat its impact. Moreover, although multiple COVID-19 vaccines have received regulatory approval and are currently being distributed to certain high-risk population groups, it is too early to know how quickly these vaccines can be distributed to the general population and how effective they will be in mitigating the adverse social and economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. If the pandemic continues to cause significant negative impacts to economic conditions, the Corporation\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely impacted.\nThe Corporation\u2019s business is dependent upon the willingness and ability of its customers to conduct banking and other financial transactions. In an effort to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, the Corporation has adjusted service models at certain of its financial center locations, including limiting some locations to drive-up and ATM services only, offering lobby access by appointment only, and encouraging the Corporation\u2019s customers to use electronic banking platforms. The Corporation expects some of these measures may remain in place permanently. The increased use of electronic banking platforms by the\nCorporation\u2019s customers may expose the Corporation to increased operational risks, including fraud and cybersecurity risks. In addition, the use of quarantines and social distancing methods to curtail the spread of COVID-19 - whether mandated by governmental authorities or recommended as a public health practice - may adversely affect the Corporation\u2019s operations as key personnel, employees and customers avoid physical interaction. A significant portion of the Corporation\u2019s employees has transitioned to working remotely as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which, in addition to requiring added support from the Corporation\u2019s information technology infrastructure, increases cybersecurity risks. The continued spread of COVID-19 (or an outbreak of a similar highly contagious disease) could also negatively impact the business and operations of third-party service providers who perform critical services for the Corporation\u2019s business. It is not yet known what impact these operational changes may have on the Corporation\u2019s financial performance.\nThere continues to be broad concerns related to the potential effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The aftereffects of the pandemic may continue to have an adverse effect on, among other things, (i) the Corporation\u2019s ability to attract customer deposits, (ii) the ability of the Corporation\u2019s borrowers to satisfy their obligations, (iii) the demand for the Corporation\u2019s loans or the Corporation\u2019s other products and services and/or (iv) unemployment rates, financial markets, real estate markets or economic growth. Further, the timing and ability of the Corporation\u2019s customers\u2019 businesses to re-open and ramp up to prior levels of activity will vary, depending upon geography, industry and other factors.\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 has significantly affected the financial markets and has resulted in a number of responses by the U.S. government, including reductions in interest rates by the FOMC. These reductions in interest rates, especially if prolonged, could adversely affect the Corporation\u2019s net interest income and margins and the Corporation\u2019s profitability for an uncertain period of time.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the economy heightens the risk associated with many of the risk factors described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including those related to economic conditions in the Corporation\u2019s market areas, interest rates, loan losses, operational risks, the Corporation\u2019s reliance on its executives and third party service providers and impairments of goodwill and intangible assets.\nGovernmental and regulatory actions to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 could increase regulatory compliance risks and result in a material decline in the Corporation\u2019s earnings.\nThere have been several regulatory and legislative actions intended to help mitigate the adverse economic impact of COVID-19 on individuals, including mandates requiring financial institutions to work constructively with borrowers affected by COVID-19 and mandatory loan forbearances. Due to the unforeseen nature of the pandemic, future regulatory action is highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. Although the state-wide eviction and foreclosure moratoriums have expired in some of the states we do business, there are federal prohibitions. Further, there have been several other bank regulatory actions and legislative changes intended to help mitigate the adverse impact of COVID-19. There continues to be mounting pressure on federal and state officials to take further action. In addition, the Corporation\u2019s administration of COVID-19 relief programs is likely to be subject to greater regulatory scrutiny. For example, the newly appointed Acting Director of the CFPB recently expressed concerns regarding some regulated companies\u2019 administration of COVID-19 relief programs and communicated the CFPB\u2019s intent to take aggressive action and expedite enforcement actions to ensure that regulated companies follow the law and meet their obligations to assist consumers during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe Corporation has offered, and may continue to offer, payment deferrals, forbearances, fee waivers, and other forms of assistance to commercial, small business and consumer customers that have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. If these customers are unable to repay their loans in a timely manner when payment deferrals, forbearances or other forms of assistance end, delinquency levels may increase, the Corporation may be required to reverse the accrual of interest during the deferral or forbearance period, and the Corporation may need to increase its ACL through provisions for credit losses. In addition, the existence of deferrals, forbearances and other forms of assistance provided to borrowers impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic may not be considered TDRs or be required to be reflected as delinquent during the applicable deferral or forbearance period, and may make it more challenging to identify deterioration in individual borrower performance and in the loan portfolio generally. See Item 1. \"Business-Supervision and Regulation-Governmental and Regulatory Actions to Mitigate the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic.\"\nThe Corporation originated a significant number of loans under the SBA\u2019s Paycheck Protection Program, which may expose the Corporation to potential risks and may result in a large number of such loans remaining on the Corporation\u2019s consolidated balance sheets.\nThe Corporation is a participating lender under the PPP, a loan program administered through the SBA, that was created to help eligible businesses, organizations and self-employed persons fund their operating costs during the COVID-19 pandemic. There are areas of ambiguity in the laws, regulations and guidance relating to the operation of the PPP, which exposes the Corporation to potential risks relating to non-compliance with the requirements of the PPP. For example, other lenders have been named in\nlitigation related to their processes and procedures for accepting and processing applications for PPP loans and other matters related to PPP loans. In addition, the Corporation may be exposed to credit risk in connection with PPP loans if a determination is made by the SBA that a deficiency exists in the manner in which the PPP loan was originated, funded or serviced. If a deficiency is identified, the SBA may deny or limit its liability under its guaranty, or seek to recover from the Corporation amounts paid pursuant to its guaranty. Moreover, loan programs adopted by the federal government, such as the PPP and the Main Street Lending Program, while intended to lessen the impact of the pandemic on businesses, may result in a decreased demand for the Corporation\u2019s loan products. See Item 1. \"Business-Supervision and Regulation-Governmental and Regulatory Actions to Mitigate the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic.\"\nThe Corporation is subject to certain risks in connection with the establishment and level of its allowance for credit losses.\nThe ACL consists of the ACL - Loans, which is recorded as a reduction to loans on the consolidated balance sheets, and the ACL for OBS credit exposures, which is included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. While the Corporation believes that its ACL as of December 31, 2020 was sufficient to cover expected future credit losses in its financial instruments, principally the loan portfolio and OBS credit exposures, as of that date, the Corporation may need to increase its provision for credit losses in future periods due to changes in the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio or OBS credit exposures, forecasted economic conditions and growth in the loan portfolio or OBS credit exposures, among other factors, thereby negatively impacting its results of operations. The determination of the ACL depends significantly upon the Corporation's assumptions and judgments with respect to a variety of factors, including the performance of the loan portfolio, the weighted-average remaining lives of different classifications of loans within the loan portfolio and current and forecasted economic conditions, as well as changes in lending policy, the nature and volume of the portfolio, credit concentrations, specific industry risks, competition, model imprecision and legal and regulatory requirements, among other factors. If the Corporation's assumptions and judgments regarding such matters prove to be inaccurate, its ACL might not be sufficient, and additional provisions for credit losses might need to be made. Depending on the amount of such provisions for credit losses, the adverse impact on the Corporation's earnings could be material.\nFurthermore, banking regulators may require the Corporation to make additional provisions for credit losses, or otherwise recognize further loan charge-offs or impairments following their periodic reviews of the Corporation's loan portfolio, underwriting procedures and the ACL. Any increase in the ACL or loan charge-offs as required by such regulatory agencies could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's financial condition and results of operations. See \"Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Allowance for Credit Losses\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" and Item 7. \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Financial Condition-Allowance for Credit Losses and Asset Quality.\"\nThe composition of the Corporation's loan portfolio and competition for loans subject the Corporation to credit risk.\nApproximately 73% of the Corporation's loan portfolio was in commercial loans, commercial mortgage loans, and construction loans at December 31, 2020. Commercial loans, commercial mortgage loans and construction loans generally involve a greater degree of credit risk than residential mortgage loans and consumer loans because they typically have larger balances and are likely to be more sensitive to broader economic factors and conditions. Because payments on these loans often depend on the successful operation and management of businesses and properties, repayment of such loans may be affected by factors outside the borrower's control, such as adverse conditions in the real estate markets, adverse economic conditions or changes in governmental regulation.\nFurthermore, intense competition among both bank and non-bank lenders could increase pressure on the Corporation to relax its credit standards and/or underwriting criteria in order to achieve the Corporation's loan growth targets. This could result in greater challenges in the repayment or collection of loans should economic conditions, or individual borrower performance, deteriorate. Additionally, competitive pressures could drive the Corporation to consider loans and customer relationships that are outside of the Corporation's established risk appetite or target customer base, posing similar repayment and collection risk. See Item 7. \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Financial Condition-Loans.\"\nMARKET RISKS.\nThe Corporation is subject to interest rate risk.\nThe Corporation cannot predict or control changes in interest rates. The Corporation is affected by fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government, including those of the Federal Reserve Board, which regulates the national money supply and engages in other lending and investment activities in order to manage recessionary and inflationary pressures, many of which affect interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits.\nNet interest income is the difference between interest earned on interest-earning assets and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income is the most significant component of the Corporation's net income, accounting for approximately 74% of total revenues in 2020. Changes in market interest rates, in the shape of the yield curve or in spreads between different market interest rates can have a material effect on the Corporation's net interest margin, or the difference between interest earned on loans and investments and interest paid on deposits and borrowings. The rates on some interest-earning assets, such as loans and investments, and interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings, adjust concurrently with, or within a brief period after, changes in market interest rates, while others adjust only periodically or not at all during their terms. Thus, changes in market interest rates might, for example, result in a decrease in the interest earned on interest-earning assets that is not accompanied by a corresponding decrease in the interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities, or the decrease in interest paid might be at a slower pace, or in a smaller amount, than the decrease in interest earned, reducing the Corporation's net interest income and/or net interest margin. See Item 7. \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Net Interest Income.\"\nChanges in interest rates may also affect the average life of loans and certain investment securities, most notably mortgage-backed securities. Decreases in interest rates can result in increased prepayments of loans and certain investment securities, as borrowers or issuers refinance to reduce their borrowing costs. Under those circumstances, the Corporation would be subject to reinvestment risk to the extent that it is not able to reinvest the cash received from such prepayments at rates that are comparable to the rates on the loans and investment securities which are prepaid. Conversely, increases in interest rates may extend the average life of fixed rate assets, which could restrict the Corporation's ability to reinvest in higher yielding alternatives, and may result in customers withdrawing certificates of deposit early so long as the early withdrawal penalty is less than the interest they could receive as a result of the higher interest rates.\nChanges in interest rates also affect the fair value of interest-earning investment securities. Generally, the value of interest-earning investment securities moves inversely with changes in interest rates. In the event that the fair value of an investment security declines below its amortized cost, the Corporation is required to determine whether the decline constitutes an OTTI. The determination of whether a decline in fair value is other-than-temporary depends on a number of factors, including whether the Corporation has the intent and ability to retain the investment security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value. If a determination is made that a decline is other-than-temporary, an OTTI charge is recorded.\nThe planned phasing out of LIBOR as a financial benchmark presents risks to the financial instruments originated or held by the Corporation.\nLIBOR is the reference rate used for many of the Corporation's transactions, including variable and adjustable rate loans, derivative contracts, borrowings and other financial instruments. However, a reduced volume of interbank unsecured term borrowing, coupled with legal and regulatory proceedings related to rate manipulation by certain financial institutions, has led to international reconsideration of LIBOR as a financial benchmark. The United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (\"FCA\"), which regulates the process for establishing LIBOR, announced in July 2017 that the FCA intends to stop persuading, or compelling, banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. Until such time, however, FCA panel banks have agreed to continue to support LIBOR.\nRegulators, industry groups and certain committees (e.g., the Alternative Reference Rates Committee) have, among other things, published recommended fallback language for LIBOR-linked financial instruments, identified recommended alternatives for certain LIBOR rates (e.g., the Secured Overnight Financing Rate and the American Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cAmeribor\u201d) as the recommended alternative to U.S. Dollar LIBOR), and proposed implementation of the recommended alternatives in floating rate instruments. At this time, it is not possible to predict whether these recommendations and proposals will be broadly accepted, whether they will continue to evolve, and what the effect of their implementation may be on the markets for floating-rate financial instruments. The uncertainty surrounding potential reforms, including the use of alternative reference rates and changes to the methods and processes used to calculate rates, may have an adverse effect on the trading market for LIBOR-based securities, loan yields, and the amounts received and paid on derivative contracts and other financial instruments. In addition, the implementation of LIBOR reform proposals may result in increased compliance and operational costs.\nChanges in interest rates can affect demand for the Corporation's products and services.\nMovements in interest rates can cause demand for some of the Corporation's products and services to be cyclical. For example, demand for residential mortgage loans has historically tended to increase during periods when interest rates were declining and to decrease during periods when interest rates were rising. As a result, the Corporation may need to periodically increase or decrease the size of certain of its businesses, including its personnel, to match increases and decreases in demand and volume. The need to change the scale of these businesses is challenging, and there is often a lag between changes in the businesses and the Corporation's reaction to these changes.\nPrice fluctuations in securities markets, as well as other market events, such as a disruption in credit and other markets and the abnormal functioning of markets for securities, could have an impact on the Corporation's results of operations.\nThe market value of the Corporation's securities investments, which include mortgage-backed securities, state and municipal securities, auction rate securities, and corporate debt securities, as well as the revenues the Corporation earns from its trust and investment management services business, are particularly sensitive to price fluctuations and market events. Declines in the values of the Corporation's securities holdings, combined with adverse changes in the expected cash flows from these investments, could result in OTTI charges.\nThe Corporation's investment management and trust services revenue, which is partially based on the value of the underlying investment portfolios, can also be impacted by fluctuations in the securities markets. If the values of those investment portfolios decrease, whether due to factors influencing U.S. or international securities markets, in general, or otherwise, the Corporation's revenue could be negatively impacted. In addition, the Corporation's ability to sell its brokerage services is dependent, in part, upon consumers' level of confidence in securities markets. See Item 7A. \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\"\nLIQUIDITY RISK.\nChanges in interest rates or disruption in liquidity markets may adversely affect the Corporation's sources of funding.\nThe Corporation must maintain sufficient sources of liquidity to meet the demands of its depositors and borrowers, support its operations and meet regulatory expectations. The Corporation's liquidity management policies and practices emphasize core deposits and repayments and maturities of loans and investments as its primary sources of liquidity. These primary sources of liquidity can be supplemented by FHLB advances, borrowings from the Federal Reserve Bank, proceeds from the sales of loans and use of liquidity resources of the Corporation, including capital markets funding. Lower-cost, core deposits may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates, and secondary sources of liquidity can be more costly to the Corporation than funding provided by deposit account balances having similar maturities. In addition, adverse changes in the Corporation's results of operations or financial condition, downgrades in the Corporation's credit ratings, regulatory actions involving the Corporation, or changes in regulatory, industry or market conditions could lead to increases in the cost of these secondary sources of liquidity, the inability to refinance or replace these secondary funding sources as they mature, or the withdrawal of unused borrowing capacity under these secondary funding sources.\nThe Corporation relies on customer deposits as its primary source of funding. A substantial majority of the Corporation's deposits are in non-maturing accounts, which deposit customers can withdraw on demand or upon several days' notice. Factors, many of which are outside the Corporation's control, can cause fluctuations in both the level and cost of customer deposits. These factors include competition for customer deposits from other financial institutions and non-bank competitors, changes in interest rates, the rates of return available from alternative investments or asset classes, changes in customer confidence in the Corporation or in financial institutions generally, and the liquidity needs of the Corporation's deposit customers. Further, deposits from state and municipal entities, primarily in non-maturing, interest-bearing accounts, are a significant source of deposit funding for the Corporation, representing approximately 11% of total deposits at December 31, 2020. State and municipal customers frequently maintain large deposit account balances substantially in excess of the per-depositor limit of FDIC insurance, and may be more sensitive than other depositors to changes in interest rates and the other factors discussed above. Advances in technology, such as online banking, mobile banking, digital payment platforms and the acceleration of financial technology innovation, have also made it easier to move money, potentially causing customers to switch financial institutions or switch to non-bank competitors. Movement of customer deposits into higher-yielding deposit accounts offered by the Corporation, the need to offer higher interest rates on deposit accounts to retain customer deposits, or the movement of customer deposits into alternative investments or deposits of other banks or non-bank providers could increase the Corporation's funding costs, reduce its net interest margin and/or create liquidity challenges.\nMarket conditions have been negatively impacted by disruptions in the liquidity markets in the past, and such disruptions or an adverse change in the Corporation's results of operations or financial condition could, in the future, have a negative impact on secondary sources of liquidity. If the Corporation is not able to continue to rely primarily on customer deposits to meet its liquidity and funding needs, continue to access secondary, non-deposit funding sources on favorable terms or otherwise fails to manage its liquidity effectively, the Corporation's ability to continue to grow may be constrained, and the Corporation's liquidity, operating margins, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected. See Item 7A. \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk-Interest Rate Risk, Asset/Liability Management and Liquidity.\"\nLEGAL, COMPLIANCE AND REPUTATIONAL RISKS.\nThe Corporation and Fulton Bank are subject to extensive regulation and supervision and may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations or any failure to comply with laws and regulations.\nVirtually every aspect of the Corporation's and Fulton Bank's operations is subject to extensive regulation and supervision by federal and state regulatory agencies, including the Federal Reserve Board, OCC, FDIC, CFPB, DOJ, UST, SEC, HUD, state attorneys general and state banking, financial services, securities and insurance regulators. Under this regulatory framework, regulatory agencies have broad authority in carrying out their supervisory, examination and enforcement responsibilities to address compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including laws and regulations relating to capital adequacy, asset quality, liquidity, risk management and financial accounting and reporting, as well as laws and regulations governing consumer protection, fair lending, privacy, information security and cybersecurity risk management, third-party vendor risk management, and AML and anti-terrorism laws, among other aspects of the Corporation's business. Failure to comply with these regulatory requirements, including inadvertent or unintentional violations, may result in the assessment of fines and penalties, or the commencement of informal or formal regulatory enforcement actions against the Corporation or Fulton Bank. Other negative consequences can also result from such failures, including regulatory restrictions on the Corporation's activities, including restrictions on the Corporation's ability to grow through acquisition, reputational damage, restrictions on the ability of institutional investment managers to invest in the Corporation's securities and increases in the Corporation's costs of doing business.\nThe U.S. Congress and state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies continually review banking and other laws, regulations and policies for possible changes. Changes in applicable federal or state laws, regulations or governmental policies may affect the Corporation and its business. The effects of such changes are difficult to predict and may produce unintended consequences. New laws, regulations or changes in the regulatory environment could limit the types of financial services and products the Corporation may offer, alter demand for existing products and services, increase the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services and products, increase compliance burdens, or otherwise adversely affect the Corporation's business, results of operations or financial condition. Further, unified Democratic control of the White House and both chambers of Congress will allow Democratic control of the legislative and executive agendas. The Corporation expects that Democratic-led Congressional committees will pursue greater oversight and will also pay increased attention to the banking sector\u2019s role in providing COVID-19-related assistance. The prospects for the enactment of major banking reform legislation under the new Congress are unclear at this time.\nFurther, the turnover of the presidential administration has produced, and likely will continue to produce, various changes in the leadership and senior staffs of the federal regulatory agencies. The heads of many of these agencies will change in 2021 pending Senate confirmation. Also, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve and the FDIC Board of Directors may experience significant turnover within the next several years. Future regulatory agendas and the impact of such on the Corporation and the financial services sector generally cannot be predicted at this time.\nCompliance with banking and financial services statutes and regulations is also important to the Corporation's ability to engage in new activities or to expand existing activities. Regulators continue to scrutinize banks through longer and more intensive examinations. Federal and state banking agencies possess broad powers to take supervisory actions, as they deem appropriate. These supervisory actions may result in higher capital requirements, higher deposit insurance premiums and limitations on the Corporation's operations and expansion activities that could have a material adverse effect on its business and profitability. The Corporation has dedicated significant time, effort, and expense over time to comply with regulatory and supervisory standards and requirements imposed by the Corporation's regulators, and the Corporation expects that it will continue to do so. If the Corporation fails to develop at a reasonable cost the systems and processes necessary to comply with the standards and requirements imposed by these rules, it could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nFailure to comply with the BSA, the Patriot Act and related AML requirements, or with sanctions laws, could subject the Corporation to enforcement actions, fines, penalties, sanctions and other remedial actions.\nRegulators have broad authority to enforce AML and sanctions laws. Failure to comply with AML and sanctions laws or to maintain an adequate compliance program can lead to significant monetary penalties and reputational damage, and federal regulators evaluate the effectiveness of an applicant in combating money laundering when considering approval of applications to acquire, merge, or consolidate with another banking institution, or to engage in other expansionary activities. There have been a number of significant enforcement actions by regulators, as well as state attorneys general and the DOJ, against banks, broker-dealers and non-bank financial institutions with respect to AML and sanctions laws and some have resulted in substantial penalties, including criminal pleas. Enforcement actions have included the Federal Reserve Board's Consent Order against the Corporation in 2014 (the \"Consent Order\"), which was terminated in May 2019, in connection with alleged deficiencies in the Corporation's BSA/AML compliance program. Any violation of law or regulation, possibly even inadvertent\nor unintentional violations, could result in the fines, sanctions or other penalties described above, including one or more additional consent orders against Fulton Bank or the Corporation, which could have significant reputational or other consequences and could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditional expenses and investments have been incurred in recent years as the Corporation expanded its hiring of personnel and use of outside professionals, such as consulting and legal services, and made capital investments in operating systems to strengthen and support the Corporation's BSA/AML compliance program, as well as the Corporation's broader compliance and risk management infrastructures. The expense and capital investment associated with all of these efforts, including those undertaken in connection with the Consent Order, have had an adverse effect on the Corporation's results of operations in recent periods and could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's results of operations in one or more future periods.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act continues to have a significant impact on the Corporation's business and results of operations.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act has had a substantial impact on many aspects of the financial services industry. The Corporation has been impacted, and will likely continue to be impacted in the future, by the so-called Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act, which reduced debit card interchange revenue of banks, and revised FDIC deposit insurance assessments. The Corporation has also been impacted by the Dodd-Frank Act in the areas of corporate governance, capital requirements, risk management and regulation under federal consumer protection laws.\nThe CFPB, which was established pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, has imposed enforcement actions against a variety of bank and non-bank market participants with respect to a number of consumer financial products and services. These actions have resulted in those participants expending significant time, money and resources to adjust to the initiatives being pursued by the CFPB. These enforcement actions may serve as precedent for how the CFPB interprets and enforces consumer protection laws, including practices or acts that are deemed to be unfair, deceptive or abusive, with respect to all supervised institutions, which may result in the imposition of higher standards of compliance with such laws. Other federal financial regulatory agencies, including the OCC, as well as state attorneys general and state banking agencies and other state financial regulators, also have been active in this area with respect to institutions over which they have jurisdiction. Federal financial regulatory agencies may be even more active in this area under the Biden Administration. See Item 1. \"Business-Supervision and Regulation.\"\nChanges in U.S. federal, state or local tax laws may negatively impact the Corporation's financial performance.\nThe Corporation is subject to changes in tax law that could increase the Corporation's effective tax rates. These law changes may be retroactive to previous periods and, as a result, could negatively affect the Corporation's current and future financial performance. In December 2017, the Tax Act was signed into law, which resulted in significant changes to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Code\"). The Tax Act reduced the Corporation's Federal corporate income tax rate to 21% beginning in 2018. However, the Tax Act also imposed limitations on the Corporation's ability to take certain deductions, such as the deduction for FDIC deposit insurance premiums, which partially offset the increase in net income from the lower tax rate.\nIn addition, a number of the changes to the Code are set to expire in future years. There is substantial uncertainty concerning whether those expiring provisions will be extended, or whether future legislation will further revise the Code.\nFrom time to time the Corporation may be the subject of litigation and governmental or administrative proceedings. Adverse outcomes of any such litigation or proceedings may have a material adverse impact on the Corporation's business and results of operations as well as its reputation.\nMany aspects of the Corporation's business involve substantial risk of legal liability. From time to time, the Corporation has been named or threatened to be named as defendant in various lawsuits arising from its business activities (and in some cases from the activities of companies that were acquired). In addition, the Corporation is periodically the subject of governmental investigations and other forms of regulatory or governmental inquiry. For example, as previously disclosed, the Corporation recently consented to the entry of an administrative civil cease-and-desist order and paid a civil monetary penalty of $1.5 million to resolve an investigation by the staff of the Division of Enforcement of the SEC regarding certain accounting determinations that could have impacted the Corporation's reported earnings per share. Like other large financial institutions, the Corporation is also subject to risk from potential employee misconduct, including non-compliance with policies and improper use or disclosure of confidential information. These lawsuits, investigations, inquiries and other matters could lead to administrative, civil or criminal proceedings, or result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, restitution, injunctions or other types of sanctions, or the need for the Corporation to undertake remedial actions, or to alter its business, financial or accounting practices. Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory actions against the Corporation could materially adversely affect the Corporation's business, financial condition or results of operations and/or cause significant reputational harm. The Corporation establishes reserves for legal claims when payments associated with the claims become probable and the\ncosts can be reasonably estimated. For matters where a loss is not probable, or the amount of the loss cannot be reasonably estimated by the Corporation, no loss reserve is established. However, the Corporation may still incur potentially significant legal costs for a matter, even if a reserve has not been established.\nThe Corporation can provide no assurance as to the outcome or resolution of legal or administrative actions or investigations, and such actions and investigations may result in judgments against the Corporation for significant damages or the imposition of regulatory restrictions on the Corporation's operations. Resolution of these types of matters can be prolonged and costly, and the ultimate results or judgments are uncertain due to the inherent uncertainty in the outcomes of litigation and other proceedings.\nSTRATEGIC AND EXTERNAL RISKS.\nThe Corporation may not be able to achieve its growth plans.\nThe Corporation's business plan includes the pursuit of profitable growth. Under current economic, competitive and regulatory conditions, profitable growth may be difficult to achieve due to one or more of the following factors:\n\u2022In the current interest rate environment, it may become more difficult for the Corporation to further increase its net interest margin or its net interest margin may come under further downward pressure. As a result, income growth will likely need to come from growth in the volume of earning assets, particularly loans, and an increase in non-interest income. However, customer demand and competition could make such income growth difficult to achieve; and\n\u2022The Corporation may seek to supplement organic growth through acquisitions, but may not be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities, obtain the required regulatory approvals or successfully integrate acquired businesses.\nTo achieve profitable growth, the Corporation may pursue new lines of business or offer new products or services, all of which can involve significant costs, uncertainties and risks. Any new activity the Corporation pursues may require a significant investment of time and resources, and may not generate the anticipated return on that investment. Sustainable growth requires that the Corporation manage risks by balancing loan and deposit growth at acceptable levels of risk, maintaining adequate liquidity and capital, hiring and retaining qualified employees, successfully managing the costs and implementation risks with respect to strategic projects and initiatives, and integrating acquisition targets while managing costs. In addition, the Corporation may not be able to effectively implement and manage any new activities. External factors, such as the need to comply with additional regulations, the availability, or introduction, of competitive alternatives in the market, and changes in customer preferences may also impact the successful implementation of any new activity. Any new activity could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of the Corporation's system of internal controls. If the Corporation is not able to adequately identify and manage the risks associated with new activities, the Corporation's business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted.\nThe Corporation faces a variety of risks in connection with potential acquisitions.\nThe Corporation may seek to supplement organic growth through acquisitions of banks or branches, or other financial businesses or assets. Acquiring other banks, branches, financial businesses or assets involves a variety of risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including, among other things:\n\u2022The possible loss of key employees and customers of the acquired business;\n\u2022Potential disruption of the acquired business and the Corporation's business;\n\u2022Exposure to potential asset quality issues of the acquired business;\n\u2022Potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the acquired business including, without limitation, liabilities for regulatory and compliance issues;\n\u2022Potential changes in banking or tax laws or regulations that may affect the acquired business; and\n\u2022Potential difficulties in integrating the acquired business, resulting in the diversion of resources from the operation of the Corporation's existing businesses.\nAcquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and market values, and therefore, some dilution of the Corporation's tangible book value and net income per common share may occur in connection with any future transaction. Failure to realize the expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence, and/or other projected benefits from an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the Corporation faces significant competition from other financial services institutions, some of which may have greater financial resources than the Corporation, when considering acquisition opportunities. Accordingly, attractive opportunities may not be available and there can be no assurance that the Corporation will be successful in identifying, completing or integrating future acquisitions.\nThe competition the Corporation faces is significant and may reduce the Corporation's customer base and negatively impact the Corporation's results of operations.\nThere is significant competition among commercial banks in the market areas served by the Corporation. In addition, the Corporation also competes with other providers of financial services, such as savings and loan associations, credit unions, consumer finance companies, securities firms, insurance companies, commercial finance and leasing companies, the mutual funds industry, full service brokerage firms and discount brokerage firms, some of which are subject to less extensive regulation than the Corporation and have different cost structures. Some of the Corporation's competitors have greater resources, higher lending limits, lower cost of funds and may offer other services not offered by the Corporation. The Corporation also experiences competition from a variety of institutions outside its market areas. Some of these institutions conduct business primarily over the Internet and, as a result, may be able to realize certain cost savings and offer products and services at more favorable rates and with greater convenience to the customer. The financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation. In addition, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non-banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks, such as funds transfers, payment services, residential mortgage loans, consumer loans and wealth and investment management services. Competition with non-banks, including technology companies, to provide financial products and services is intensifying. In particular, the activity of financial technology companies (\"Fintechs\") has grown significantly over recent years and is expected to continue to grow. Fintechs have and may continue to offer bank or bank-like products. In July 2018, the OCC announced that it will begin accepting applications from Fintechs to become special purpose national banks. Although the OCC\u2019s authority to issue special purpose bank charters to non-bank Fintechs continues to be subject to ongoing litigation, similar developments are likely to result in even greater competition within all areas of the Corporation\u2019s operations.\nCompetition may adversely affect the rates the Corporation pays on deposits and charges on loans, and could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and the income generated from those deposits, thereby potentially adversely affecting the Corporation's profitability and its ability to continue to grow. The Corporation's profitability and continued growth depends upon its continued ability to successfully compete in the market areas it serves. See Item 1. \"Business-Competition.\"\nClimate change may materially adversely affect the Corporation's business and results of operations.\nThe Corporation operates in areas where its business and the activities of its customers could be impacted by the effects of climate change. The effects of climate change may include increased frequency or severity of weather-related events, such as severe storms, hurricanes, flooding and droughts, and rising sea levels. These effects can disrupt business operations, damage property, devalue assets and change consumer and business preferences, which may adversely affect borrowers, increase credit risk and reduce demand for the Corporation\u2019s products and services. In addition, increasing concerns over the long-term impacts of climate change have led and will likely continue to lead to legislative and regulatory initiatives to combat climate change and may result in increased supervisory expectations with respect to banks\u2019 risk management practices related to climate change. Climate change, its effects and the resulting, unknown impacts could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nIf the goodwill that the Corporation has recorded or records in the future in connection with its acquisitions becomes impaired, it could have a negative impact on the Corporation's results of operations.\nIn the past, the Corporation supplemented its internal growth with strategic acquisitions of banks, branches and other financial services companies. In the future, the Corporation may seek to supplement organic growth through additional acquisitions. If the purchase price of an acquired company exceeds the fair value of the company's net assets, the excess is carried on the acquirer's balance sheet as goodwill. As of December 31, 2020, the Corporation had $533.4 million of goodwill recorded on its balance sheet. The Corporation is required to evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually. Write-downs of the amount of any impairment, if necessary, are to be charged to earnings in the period in which the impairment occurs. There can be no assurance that future evaluations of goodwill will not result in impairment charges.\nChanges in accounting policies, standards, and interpretations could materially affect how the Corporation reports its financial condition and results of operations.\nThe preparation of the Corporation's financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, as well as revenues and expenses during the period. A summary of the accounting policies that the Corporation considers to be most important to the presentation of its financial condition and results of operations, because they require management's most difficult judgments as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain, including those related to the ACL, goodwill, income taxes, and fair value measurements, is set forth in Item 7. \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies\" and within \"Note 1-\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies,\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\nA variety of factors could affect the ultimate values of assets, liabilities, income and expenses recognized and reported in the Corporation's financial statements, and these ultimate values may differ materially from those determined based on management's estimates and assumptions. In addition, the FASB, regulatory agencies, and other bodies that establish accounting standards from time to time change the financial accounting and reporting standards governing the preparation of the Corporation's financial statements. Further, those bodies that establish and interpret the accounting standards (such as the FASB, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and banking regulators) may change prior interpretations or positions regarding how these standards should be applied. These changes can be difficult to predict and can materially affect how the Corporation records and reports its financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Corporation has from time to time undertaken initiatives to reduce or manage growth in its non-interest expenses and increase the efficiency of its operations. The Corporation may not achieve the intended effect on its non-interest expenses or its operating efficiency, and those initiatives may have an adverse impact on the Corporation\u2019s competitive position and ability to achieve its growth plans.\nIt is possible that initiatives from time to time undertaken by the Corporation to reduce or manage growth in its non-interest expenses and increase its operating efficiency will not achieve the effects on its non-interest expenses or create the cost efficiencies intended through those initiatives. Moreover, those initiatives could adversely impact the retention of customers and deposit balances, harm the Corporation\u2019s relationships with its customers, weaken the Corporation\u2019s competitive position, or make it more difficult for the Corporation to achieve its growth plans. Any of these circumstances, should they arise, could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business or results of operations.\nOPERATIONAL RISKS.\nThe Corporation is exposed to many types of operational and other risks, and the Corporation's framework for managing risks may not be effective in mitigating risk.\nThe Corporation is exposed to many types of operational risk, including the risk of human error or fraud by employees and other third parties, intentional and inadvertent misrepresentation by loan applicants, borrowers or guarantors, unsatisfactory performance by employees and vendors, clerical and record-keeping errors, computer and telecommunications systems malfunctions or failures and reliance on data that may be faulty or incomplete. In an environment characterized by continual, rapid technological change, as discussed below, when the Corporation introduces new products and services, or makes changes to its information technology systems and processes, these operational risks are increased. Any of these operational risks could result in the Corporation's diminished ability to operate one or more of its businesses, financial loss, potential liability to customers, inability to secure insurance, reputational damage and regulatory intervention, which could materially adversely affect the Corporation.\nThe Corporation's risk management framework is subject to inherent limitations, and risks may exist, or develop in the future, that the Corporation has not anticipated or identified. If the Corporation's risk management framework proves to be ineffective, the Corporation could suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected.\nThe Corporation's operational risks include risks associated with third-party vendors and other financial institutions.\nThe Corporation relies upon certain third-party vendors to provide products and services necessary to maintain its day-to-day operations, including, notably, responsibility for the core processing system that services Fulton Bank. Accordingly, the Corporation's operations are exposed to the risk that these vendors might not perform in accordance with applicable contractual arrangements or service level agreements. The failure of an external vendor to perform in accordance with applicable contractual arrangements or service level agreements could be disruptive to the Corporation's operations, which could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's financial condition or results of operations, and damage its reputation. Further, third-party vendor risk management has become a point of regulatory emphasis recently. A failure of the Corporation to follow applicable regulatory guidance in this area could expose the Corporation to regulatory sanctions.\nThe commercial soundness of many financial institutions may be closely interrelated as a result of credit, trading, execution of transactions or other relationships between the institutions. As a result, concerns about, or a default or threatened default by, one institution could lead to significant market-wide liquidity and credit problems, losses or defaults by other institutions. This risk is sometimes referred to as \"systemic risk\" and may adversely affect financial intermediaries, such as clearing agencies, clearing houses, banks, securities firms and exchanges, with which the Corporation interacts on a daily basis, and therefore could adversely affect the Corporation.\nAny of these operational or other risks could result in the Corporation's diminished ability to operate one or more of its businesses, financial loss, potential liability to customers, inability to secure insurance, reputational damage and regulatory intervention, which could materially adversely affect the Corporation.\nLoss of, or failure to adequately safeguard, confidential or proprietary information may adversely affect the Corporation's operations, net income or reputation.\nThe Corporation's business is highly dependent on information systems and technology and the ability to collect, process, transmit and store significant amounts of confidential information regarding customers, employees and others on a daily basis. While the Corporation performs some of the functions required to operate its business directly, it also relies on third parties for significant business functions, such as processing customer transactions, providing cloud-based infrastructure, software and data storage services, maintaining customer-facing websites, including its online and mobile banking functions, and developing software for new products and services, among others. These relationships require the Corporation to allow third parties to access, store, process and transmit customer information. As a result, the Corporation may be subject to cyber security risks directly, as well as indirectly, through the vendors to whom it outsources business functions and the downstream service providers of those vendors. The increased use of smartphones, tablets and other mobile devices, as well as cloud computing, may also heighten these and other operational risks. Cyber threats could result in unauthorized access, loss or destruction of confidential information or customer data, unavailability, degradation or denial of service, introduction of computer viruses or ransomware and other adverse events, causing the Corporation to incur additional costs (such as repairing systems or adding new personnel or protection technologies). Cyber threats may also subject the Corporation to regulatory investigations, litigation or enforcement actions require the payment of regulatory fines or penalties or undertaking costly remediation efforts with respect to third parties affected by a cyber security incident, all or any of which could adversely affect the Corporation's business, financial condition or results of operations and damage its reputation.\nLike other financial institutions, the Corporation experiences malicious cyber activity on an ongoing basis directed at its websites, computer systems, software, networks and its users. This malicious activity includes attempts at unauthorized access, implantation of computer viruses or malware, and denial-of-service attacks. The Corporation also experiences large volumes of phishing and other forms of social engineering attempted for the purpose of perpetrating fraud against the Corporation, its employees or its customers. While, to date, malicious cyber activity, cyber attacks and other information security breaches have not had a material adverse impact on the Corporation, there can be no assurance that such events will not have a material adverse impact on the Corporation\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition or reputation in the future.\nThe Corporation uses monitoring and preventive controls to detect and respond to data breaches and cyber threats involving its own systems before they become significant. The Corporation regularly evaluates its systems and controls and implements upgrades as necessary. The Corporation also attempts to reduce its exposure to its vendors' data privacy and cyber incidents by performing initial vendor due diligence that is updated periodically for critical vendors, negotiating service level standards with vendors, negotiating for indemnification from vendors for confidentiality and data breaches, and limiting third-party access to the least privileged level necessary to perform outsourced functions, among other things. The additional cost to the Corporation of data and cyber security monitoring and protection systems and controls includes the cost of hardware and software, third party technology providers, consulting and forensic testing firms, insurance premium costs and legal fees, in addition to the incremental cost of personnel who focus a substantial portion of their responsibilities on data and cyber security.\nThere can be no assurance that the measures employed by the Corporation to detect and combat direct or indirect cyber threats will be effective. In addition, because the methods of cyber attacks change frequently or, in some cases, are not recognized until launched, the Corporation may be unable to implement effective preventive control measures to proactively address these methods. The Corporation's or a vendor's failure to promptly identify and counter a cyber attack may result in increased costs and other negative consequences, such as the loss of, or inability to access, data, degradation or denial of service and introduction of computer viruses. Although the Corporation maintains insurance coverage that may, subject to policy terms and conditions, cover certain aspects of cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be inapplicable or otherwise insufficient to cover any or all losses. Further, a successful cyber attack that results in a significant loss of customer data or compromises the Corporation's ability to function would have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's business, reputation, financial condition and results of operation.\nAccount data compromise, malware and ransomware events affecting a broad spectrum of commercial businesses and governmental entities in recent years have resulted in heightened legislative and regulatory focus on privacy, data protection and information security. New or revised laws and regulations may significantly impact the Corporation's current and planned privacy, data protection and information security-related practices, the collection, use, sharing, retention and safeguarding of consumer and employee information, and current or planned business activities. Compliance with current or future privacy, data protection and information security laws to which the Corporation is subject could result in higher compliance and technology costs and could restrict the Corporation's ability to provide certain products and services, which could materially and adversely affect the Corporation's profitability. The Corporation's failure to comply with privacy, data protection and information security\nlaws could result in potentially significant regulatory and governmental investigations and/or actions, litigation, fines, sanctions and damage to the Corporation's reputation and its brand.\nThe Corporation is subject to a variety of risks in connection with origination and sale of loans.\nThe Corporation originates residential mortgage loans and other loans, such as loans guaranteed, in part, by the SBA, all or portions of which are later sold in the secondary market to government sponsored enterprises or agencies, such as the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), and other non-government sponsored investors. In connection with such sales, the Corporation makes certain representations and warranties with respect to matters such as the underwriting, origination, documentation or other characteristics of the loans sold. The Corporation may be required to repurchase a loan, or to reimburse the purchaser of a loan for any related losses, if it is determined that the loan sold was in violation of representations or warranties made at the time of the sale, and, in some cases, if there is evidence of borrower fraud, in the event of early payment default by the borrower on the loan, or for other reasons. The Corporation maintains reserves for potential losses on certain loans sold, however, it is possible that losses incurred in connection with loan repurchases and reimbursement payments may be in excess of any applicable reserves, and the Corporation may be required to increase reserves and may sustain additional losses associated with such loan repurchases and reimbursement payments in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition, the sale of residential mortgage loans and other loans in the secondary market serves as a source of non-interest income and liquidity for the Corporation, and can reduce its exposure to risks arising from changes in interest rates. Efforts to reform government sponsored enterprises and agencies, changes in the types of, or standards for, loans purchased by government sponsored enterprises or agencies and other investors, or the Corporation's failure to maintain its status as an eligible seller of such loans may limit the Corporation's ability to sell these loans. The inability of the Corporation to continue to sell these loans could reduce the Corporation's non-interest income, limit the Corporation's ability to originate and fund these loans in the future, and make managing interest rate risk more challenging, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Corporation continually encounters technological change.\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. The Corporation's future success depends, in part, upon its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in the Corporation's operations. The costs of new technology, including personnel, can be high, in both absolute and relative terms. Many of the Corporation's financial institution competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. In addition, new payment, credit and investment and wealth management services developed and offered by non-bank or non-traditional competitors pose an increasing threat to the products and services traditionally provided by financial institutions like the Corporation. The Corporation may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services, be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers, or effectively deploy new technologies to improve the efficiency of its operations. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on the Corporation's business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThere can be no assurance, given the past pace of change and innovation, that the Corporation's technology, either purchased or developed internally, will meet or continue to meet the needs of the Corporation and the needs of its customers.\nIn addition, advances in technology, as well as changing customer preferences favoring access to the Corporation's products and services through digital channels, could decrease the value of the Corporation's branch network and other assets. If customers increasingly choose to access the Corporation's products and services through digital channels, the Corporation may find it necessary to consolidate, close or sell branch locations or restructure its branch network. These actions could lead to losses on assets, expenses to reconfigure branches and the loss of customers in affected markets. As a result, the Corporation's business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected.\nRISKS RELATED TO AN INVESTMENT IN THE CORPORATION'S SECURITIES.\nCapital requirements have been adopted by U.S. banking regulators that may limit the Corporation's ability to return earnings to shareholders or operate or invest in its business.\nThe Corporation and Fulton Bank are subject to capital requirements under the Basel III Rules. Failure to meet the established capital requirements could result in the federal banking regulators placing limitations or conditions on the activities of the Corporation or Fulton Bank or restricting the commencement of new activities, and such failure could subject the Corporation\nor Fulton Bank to a variety of enforcement remedies, including limiting the ability of the Corporation or Fulton Bank to pay dividends, issuing a directive to increase capital and terminating FDIC deposit insurance. In addition, the failure to comply with the capital conservation buffer will result in restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary cash bonus payments to executive officers. As of December 31, 2020, the Corporation's current capital levels met the minimum capital requirements, including the capital conservation buffer, as set forth in the Basel III Rules. See Item 1. \"Business-Supervision and Regulation-Capital Requirements.\"\nIn addition, the implementation of certain regulations with regard to regulatory capital could disproportionately affect the Corporation's regulatory capital position relative to that of its competitors, including those who may not be subject to the same regulatory requirements.\nThe Corporation is a holding company and relies on dividends and other payments from its subsidiaries for substantially all of its revenue and its ability to make dividend payments, distributions and other payments.\nFulton Financial Corporation is a separate and distinct legal entity from its bank and non-bank subsidiaries, and depends on the payment of dividends and other payments and distributions from its subsidiaries, principally Fulton Bank, for substantially all of its revenues. As a result, the Corporation's ability to make dividend payments on its common stock depends primarily on compliance with applicable federal regulatory requirements and the receipt of dividends and other distributions from its subsidiaries. There are various regulatory and prudential supervisory restrictions, which may change from time to time, that impact the ability of Fulton Bank to pay dividends or make other payments to the Corporation. There can be no assurance that Fulton Bank will be able to pay dividends at past levels, or at all, in the future. If the Corporation does not receive sufficient cash dividends or is unable to borrow from Fulton Bank, then the Corporation may not have sufficient funds to pay dividends to its shareholders, repurchase its common stock or service its debt obligations. See Item 1. \"Business-Supervision and Regulation-Loans and Dividends from Bank Subsidiary.\"\nIn addition, the Corporation has pursued a strategy of capital management under which it has sought to deploy its capital, through stock repurchases, increased regular dividends and special dividends, in a manner that is beneficial to the Corporation's shareholders. This capital management strategy is subject to regulatory supervision. In July 2019, the Federal Reserve Board eliminated the standalone prior approval requirement in the capital rules for repurchase or redemption of common stock. In certain circumstances, however, the Corporation's repurchases of its common stock may be subject to a prior approval or notice requirement under the regulations or policies of the Federal Reserve Board. As a result, the Corporation may not be able to enter the market for stock repurchases on a timely basis when the Corporation's board of directors and management believe such repurchases to be most opportune, or at all.\nAnti-takeover provisions could negatively impact the Corporation's shareholders.\nProvisions of banking laws, Pennsylvania corporate law and of the Corporation's Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of the Corporation or have the effect of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire control of the Corporation. To the extent that these provisions discourage such a transaction, holders of the Corporation's common stock may not have an opportunity to dispose of part or all of their stock at a higher price than that prevailing in the market. These provisions may also adversely affect the market price of the Corporation's stock. In addition, some of these provisions make it more difficult to remove, and thereby may serve to entrench, the Corporation's incumbent directors and officers, even if their removal would be regarded by some shareholders as desirable.\nCertain provisions of Pennsylvania corporate law applicable to the Corporation and the Corporation's Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws include provisions which may be considered to be \"anti-takeover\" in nature because they may have the effect of discouraging or making more difficult the acquisition of control of the Corporation by means of a hostile tender offer, exchange offer, proxy contest or similar transaction. These provisions are intended to protect the Corporation's shareholders by providing a measure of assurance that the Corporation's shareholders will be treated fairly in the event of an unsolicited takeover bid and by preventing a successful takeover bidder from exercising its voting control to the detriment of the other shareholders. However, these provisions, taken as a whole, may also discourage a hostile tender offer, exchange offer, proxy solicitation or similar transaction relating to the Corporation's common stock, even if the accomplishment of a given transaction may be favorable to the interests of shareholders.\nThe ability of a third party to acquire the Corporation is also limited under applicable banking regulations. The BHCA requires any \"bank holding company\" (as defined in that Act) to obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve Board prior to acquiring more than 5% of the Corporation's outstanding common stock. Any person other than a bank holding company is required to obtain prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board to acquire 10% or more of the Corporation's outstanding common stock under the Change in Bank Control Act of 1978 and, under certain circumstances, such approvals are required at an even lower ownership percentage. Any holder of 25% or more of the Corporation's outstanding common stock, other than an individual, is\nsubject to regulation as a bank holding company under the BHCA. In addition, the delays associated with obtaining necessary regulatory approvals for acquisitions of interests in bank holding companies also tend to make more difficult certain methods of effecting acquisitions. While these provisions do not prohibit an acquisition, they would likely act as deterrents to an unsolicited takeover attempt.\nGENERAL RISK FACTORS.\nNegative publicity could damage the Corporation's reputation and business.\nReputation risk, or the risk to the Corporation's earnings and capital from negative public opinion, is inherent in the Corporation's business. Negative public opinion could result from the Corporation's actual, alleged or perceived conduct in any number of activities, including lending practices, litigation, regulatory compliance, mergers and acquisitions, disclosure, sharing or inadequate protection of customer information, environmental, social and governance practices and disclosures, and from actions taken by government agencies and community organizations in response to that conduct. In addition, unfavorable public opinion regarding the broader financial services industry, or arising from the actions of individual financial institutions, can have an adverse effect on the Corporation's reputation. Because the Corporation conducts its businesses under the \"Fulton\" brand, negative public opinion about one line of business could affect the Corporation's other lines of businesses. Further, the increased use of social media platforms facilitates the rapid and widespread dissemination of information, including inaccurate, misleading, or false information, which could magnify the potential harm to the Corporation's reputation. Any of these or other events that impair the Corporation's reputation can affect the Corporation's ability to attract and retain customers and employees, and access sources of funding and capital, any of which could have materially adverse effect on the Corporation's results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Corporation's internal controls may be ineffective.\nOne critical component of the Corporation's risk management framework is its system of internal controls. Management regularly reviews and updates the Corporation's internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the controls are met. Any failure or circumvention of the Corporation's controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's business, results of operations, financial condition and reputation. See Item 9A. \"Controls and Procedures.\"\nThe Corporation may not be able to attract and retain skilled people.\nThe Corporation's success depends, in large part, on its ability to attract and retain skilled people. Competition for talented personnel in most activities engaged in by the Corporation can be intense, and the Corporation may not be able to hire sufficiently skilled people or to retain them. The unexpected loss of services of one or more of the Corporation's key personnel could have a material adverse impact on the Corporation's business because of their skills, knowledge of the Corporation's markets, years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel.\nA downgrade in the credit ratings of the Corporation or Fulton Bank could have a material adverse impact on the Corporation.\nMoody's Investors Service, Inc. and DBRS, Inc. continuously evaluate the Corporation and Fulton Bank, and their ratings of the Corporation's and Fulton Bank's long-term and short-term debt and preferred stock are based on a number of factors, including financial strength, as well as factors not entirely within the Corporation's and Fulton Bank's control, such as conditions affecting the financial services industry generally. In light of these reviews and the continued focus on the financial services industry generally, the Corporation and Fulton Bank may not be able to maintain their current respective ratings. Ratings downgrades by any of these credit rating agencies could have a significant and immediate impact on the Corporation's funding and liquidity through cash obligations, reduced funding capacity and collateral triggers. A reduction in the Corporation's or Fulton Bank's credit ratings could also increase the Corporation's and Fulton Bank's borrowing costs and limit their access to the capital markets.\nDowngrades in the credit or financial strength ratings assigned to the counterparties with whom the Corporation transacts could create the perception that the Corporation's financial condition will be adversely impacted as a result of potential future defaults by such counterparties. Additionally, the Corporation could be adversely affected by a general, negative perception of financial institutions caused by the downgrade of other financial institutions. Accordingly, ratings downgrades for other financial institutions could affect the market price of the Corporation's stock and could limit the Corporation's access to or increase its cost of capital.\nThe Corporation's future growth may require the Corporation to raise additional capital in the future, but that capital may not be available when it is needed or may be available only at an excessive cost.\nThe Corporation is required by regulatory agencies to maintain adequate levels of capital to support its operations. The Corporation anticipates that current capital levels will satisfy regulatory requirements for the foreseeable future. The Corporation, however, may at some point choose to raise additional capital to support future growth. The Corporation's ability to raise additional capital will depend, in part, on conditions in the financial markets at that time, which are outside of the Corporation's control. Accordingly, the Corporation may be unable to raise additional capital, if and when needed, on terms acceptable to the Corporation, or at all.\nIf the Corporation cannot raise additional capital when needed, its ability to expand operations through internal growth and acquisitions could be materially impacted. In the event of a material decrease in the Corporation's stock price, future issuances of equity securities could result in dilution of existing shareholder interests.", "PERMNO": 88197, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "FULT"}
