RISK FACTORS.\nThe following is a discussion of the primary factors that may affect the operations and/or financial performance of our regulated and unregulated energy businesses. Refer to the section entitled Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Annual Report for an additional discussion of these and other related factors that affect our operations and/or financial performance.\nChesapeake Utilities Corporation 2021 Form 10-K Page 14\nFINANCIAL RISKS\nInstability and volatility in the financial markets could negatively impact access to capital at competitive rates, which could affect our ability to implement our strategic plan, undertake improvements and make other investments required for our future growth.\nOur business strategy includes the continued pursuit of growth and requires capital investment in excess of cash flow from operations. As a result, the successful execution of our strategy is dependent upon access to equity and debt at reasonable costs. Our ability to issue new debt and equity capital and the cost of equity and debt are greatly affected by our financial performance and the conditions of the financial markets. In addition, our ability to obtain adequate and cost-effective debt depends on our credit ratings. A downgrade in our current credit ratings could negatively impact our access to and cost of debt. If we are not able to access capital at competitive rates, our ability to implement our strategic plan, undertake improvements and make other investments required for our future growth may be limited.\nFluctuations in propane gas prices could negatively affect results of operations.\nWe adjust the price of the propane we sell based on changes in our cost of purchasing propane. However, if the market does not allow us to increase propane sales prices to compensate fully for fluctuations in purchased propane costs, our results of operations and cash flows could be negatively affected.\nIf we fail to comply with our debt covenant obligations, we could experience adverse financial consequences that could affect our liquidity and ability to borrow funds.\nOur long-term debt obligations and the Revolver contain financial covenants related to debt-to-capital ratios and interest-coverage ratios. Failure to comply with any of these covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of outstanding debt obligations or the inability to borrow under certain credit agreements. Any such acceleration could cause a material adverse change in our financial condition. As of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with all of our covenants.\nIncreases in interest rates may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nIncreases in interest rates could increase the cost of future debt issuances. Absent recovery of the higher debt cost in the rates we charge our utility customers, our earnings could be adversely affected. Increases in short-term interest rates could negatively affect our results of operations, which depend on short-term debt to finance accounts receivable and storage gas inventories and to temporarily finance capital expenditures. Reference should be made to Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk for additional information.\nCurrent market conditions could adversely impact the return on plan assets for FPU's pension plan, which may require significant additional funding.\nIn 2021, the Company terminated the Chesapeake Utilities pension plan. The FPU pension plan is closed to new employees, and the future benefits are frozen. The costs of providing benefits and related funding requirements of the FPU plan is subject to changes in the market value of the assets that fund the plan and the discount rates used to estimate the pension benefit obligations. The funded status of the plans and the related costs reflected in our financial statements are affected by various factors that are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty, particularly in the current economic environment. Future losses of asset values and further declines in discount rates may necessitate accelerated funding of the plans to meet minimum federal government requirements and may result in higher pension expense in future years. Adverse changes in the benefit obligations of the FPU pension plan may require us to record higher pension expense and fund obligations earlier than originally planned, which would have an adverse impact on our cash flows from operations, decrease borrowing capacity and increase interest expense.\nOPERATIONAL RISKS\nWe are dependent upon construction of new facilities to support future growth in earnings in our natural gas and electric distribution and natural gas transmission operations.\nConstruction of new facilities required to support future growth is subject to various regulatory and developmental risks, including but not limited to: (i) our ability to obtain timely certificate authorizations, necessary approvals and permits from regulatory agencies and on terms that are acceptable to us; (ii) potential changes in federal, state and local statutes and regulations, including environmental requirements, that prevent a project from proceeding or increase the anticipated cost of the project; (iii) our inability to acquire rights-of-way or land rights on a timely basis on terms that are acceptable to us;\nChesapeake Utilities Corporation 2021 Form 10-K Page 15\n(iv) lack of anticipated future growth in available natural gas and electricity supply; (v) insufficient customer throughput commitments; and (vi) lack of available and qualified third-party contractors which could impact the timely construction of new facilities.\nWe operate in a competitive environment, and we may lose customers to competitors.\nNatural Gas. Our natural gas transmission and distribution operations compete with interstate pipelines when our customers are located close enough to a competing pipeline to make direct connections economically feasible. Customers also have the option to switch to alternative fuels, including renewable energy sources. Failure to retain and grow our natural gas customer base would have an adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nElectric. Our Florida electric distribution business has remained substantially free from direct competition from other electric service providers but does face competition from other energy sources. Changes in the competitive environment caused by legislation, regulation, market conditions, or initiatives of other electric power providers, particularly with respect to retail electric competition, could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nPropane. Our propane operations compete with other propane distributors, primarily on the basis of service and price. Our ability to grow the propane operations business is contingent upon capturing additional market share, expanding into new markets, and successfully utilizing pricing programs that retain and grow our customer base. Failure to retain and grow our customer base in our propane operations would have an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nFluctuations in weather may cause a significant variance in our earnings.\nOur natural gas distribution, propane operations and natural gas transmission operations, are sensitive to fluctuations in weather conditions, which directly influence the volume of natural gas and propane we transport, sell and deliver to our customers. A significant portion of our natural gas distribution, propane operations and natural gas transmission revenue is derived from the sales and deliveries to residential, commercial and industrial heating customers during the five-month peak heating season (November through March). Other than our Maryland natural gas distribution businesses (Maryland division, Sandpiper Energy and Elkton Gas) which have revenue normalization mechanisms, if the weather is warmer than normal, we sell and deliver less natural gas and propane to customers, and earn less revenue, which could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Likewise, if the weather is colder than normal, we sell and deliver more natural gas and propane to customers, and earn more revenue, which could positively affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Variations in weather from year to year can cause our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition to vary accordingly.\nOur electric distribution operation is also affected by variations in weather conditions and unusually severe weather conditions. However, electricity consumption is generally less seasonal than natural gas and propane because it is used for both heating and cooling in our service areas.\nNatural disasters, severe weather (such as a major hurricane) and acts of terrorism could adversely impact earnings.\nInherent in energy transmission and distribution activities are a variety of hazards and operational risks, such as leaks, ruptures, fires, explosions, sabotage and mechanical problems. Natural disasters and severe weather may damage our assets, cause operational interruptions and result in the loss of human life, all of which could negatively affect our earnings, financial condition and results of operations. Acts of terrorism and the impact of retaliatory military and other action by the United States and its allies may lead to increased political, economic and financial market instability and volatility in the price of natural gas, electricity and propane that could negatively affect our operations. Companies in the energy industry may face a heightened risk of exposure to acts of terrorism, which could affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. The insurance industry may also be affected by natural disasters, severe weather and acts of terrorism; as a result, the availability of insurance covering risks against which we and our competitors typically insure may be limited. In addition, the insurance we are able to obtain may have higher deductibles, higher premiums and more restrictive policy terms, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nChesapeake Utilities Corporation 2021 Form 10-K Page 16\nOperating events affecting public safety and the reliability of our natural gas and electric distribution and transmission systems could adversely affect our operations and increase our costs.\nOur natural gas and electric operations are exposed to operational events and risks, such as major leaks, outages, mechanical failures and breakdown, operations below the expected level of performance or efficiency, and accidents that could affect public safety and the reliability of our distribution and transmission systems, significantly increase costs and cause loss of customer confidence. If we are unable to recover all or some of these costs from insurance and/or customers through the regulatory process, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nA security breach disrupting our operating systems and facilities or exposing confidential information may adversely affect our reputation, disrupt our operations and increase our costs.\nThe cybersecurity risks associated with the protection of our infrastructure and facilities is evolving and increasingly complex. We continue to heavily rely on technological tools that support our business operations and corporate functions while enhancing our security. There are various risks associated with our information technology infrastructure, including hardware and software failure, communications failure, data distortion or destruction, unauthorized access to data, misuse of proprietary or confidential data, unauthorized control through electronic means, cyber-attacks, cyber-terrorism, data breaches, programming mistakes, and other inadvertent errors or deliberate human acts. Further, the U.S. government has issued public warnings that indicate energy assets might be specific targets of cybersecurity threats by foreign sources.\nThe failure of, or security breaches related to, our information technology infrastructure, could lead to system disruptions or cause facility shutdowns. Any such failure, attack, or security breach could adversely impact our ability to safely and reliably deliver services to our customers through our transmission, distribution, and generation systems, subject to us to reputational and other harm, and subject us to legal and regulatory proceedings and claims and demands from third parties, any of which could adversely affect our business, our earnings, results of operation and financial condition. In addition, the protection of customer, employee and Company data is crucial to our operational security. A breach or breakdown of our systems that results in the unauthorized release of individually identifiable customer or other sensitive data could have an adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations and financial condition and could also materially increase our costs of maintaining our system and protecting it against future breakdowns or breaches. We take reasonable precautions to safeguard our information systems from cyber-attacks and security breaches; however, there is no guarantee that the procedures implemented to protect against unauthorized access to our information systems are adequate to safeguard against all attacks and breaches. We also cannot assure that any redundancies built into our networks and technology, or the procedures we have implemented to protect against cyber-attacks and other unauthorized access to secured data, are adequate to safeguard against all failures of technology or security breaches.\nFailure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified employee workforce could adversely affect operations.\nOur ability to implement our business strategy and serve our customers depends upon our continuing ability to attract, develop and retain talented professionals and a technically skilled workforce, and transfer the knowledge and expertise of our workforce to new employees as our existing employees retire. Failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees, including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to new employees, or the future availability and cost of contract labor could adversely affect our ability to manage and operate our business. If we were unable to hire, train and retain appropriately qualified personnel, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nA strike, work stoppage or a labor dispute could adversely affect our operations.\nWe are party to collective bargaining agreements with labor unions at some of our Florida operations. A strike, work stoppage or a labor dispute with a union or employees represented by a union could cause interruption to our operations and our results could be adversely affected.\nMandatory COVID-19 vaccination of employees or testing of employees could impact our workforce and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOn September 9, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order (the \u201cExecutive Order\u201d) requiring most employers with U.S. Government contracts to ensure that their U.S.-based employees, contractors, and subcontractors, that work on or in support of U.S. Government contracts, be fully vaccinated by December 8, 2021.This date was later postponed to January 4, 2022, to allow for the final dose of the vaccine to be administered. However, a number of federal district courts enjoined the enforcement of this federal contractor mandate. As such, the federal government cannot, at present, enforce the Executive\nChesapeake Utilities Corporation 2021 Form 10-K Page 17\nOrder and its vaccine mandate against federal contractors. The various district court orders enjoining enforcement are being appealed by the federal government.\nAt this time, it is not possible to predict with certainty the nature and extent to which we will be subject to the Executive Order, or impact the Executive Order will have on us or on our workforce. Additional vaccine mandates may be announced in other jurisdictions in which we operate, or by governmental agencies with which we provide services. Implementation of these requirements by us may result in employee attrition, including attrition of critically skilled labor, absenteeism within our skilled labor force, challenges securing future labor needs, inefficiencies connected to employee turnover, and costs associated with implementation and on-going compliance, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur businesses are capital-intensive, and the increased costs and/or delays of capital projects may adversely affect our future earnings.\nOur businesses are capital-intensive and require significant investments in ongoing infrastructure projects. Our ability to complete our infrastructure projects on a timely basis and manage the overall cost of those projects may be affected by the availability of the necessary materials and qualified vendors. Our future earnings could be adversely affected if we are unable to manage such capital projects effectively, or if full recovery of such capital costs is not permitted in future regulatory proceedings.\nOur regulated energy business may be at risk if franchise agreements are not renewed, or new franchise agreements are not obtained, which could adversely affect our future results or operating cash flows and financial condition.\nOur regulated natural gas and electric distribution operations hold franchises in each of the incorporated municipalities that require franchise agreements in order to provide natural gas and electricity. Ongoing financial results would be adversely impacted in the event that franchise agreements were not renewed. If we are unable to obtain franchise agreements for new service areas, growth in our future earnings could be negatively impacted.\nSlowdowns in customer growth may adversely affect earnings and cash flows.\nOur ability to increase revenues in our natural gas, propane and electric distribution businesses is dependent upon growth in the residential construction market, adding new commercial and industrial customers and conversion of customers to natural gas, electricity or propane from other energy sources. Slowdowns in growth may adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nEnergy conservation could lower energy consumption, which would adversely affect our earnings.\nFederal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives to promote energy efficiency, conservation and the use of alternative energy sources could lower energy consumption by our customers. In addition, higher costs of natural gas, propane and electricity may cause customers to conserve fuel. To the extent a PSC or the FERC does not allow the recovery through customer rates of higher costs or lower consumption from energy efficiency or conservation, and our propane retail prices cannot be increased due to market conditions, our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nCommodity price increases may adversely affect the operating costs and competitive positions of our natural gas, electric and propane operations, which may adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nNatural Gas/Electricity. Higher natural gas prices can significantly increase the cost of gas billed to our natural gas customers. Increases in the cost of natural gas and other fuels used to generate electricity can significantly increase the cost of electricity billed to our electric customers. Damage to the production or transportation facilities of our suppliers, which decreases their supply of natural gas and electricity, could result in increased supply costs and higher prices for our customers. Such cost increases generally have no immediate effect on our revenues and net income because of our regulated fuel cost recovery mechanisms. However, our net income may be reduced by higher expenses that we may incur for uncollectible customer accounts and by lower volumes of natural gas and electricity deliveries when customers reduce their consumption. Therefore, increases in the price of natural gas and other fuels can adversely affect our operating cash flows, results of operations and financial condition, as well as the competitiveness of natural gas and electricity as energy sources.\nPropane. Propane costs are subject to changes as a result of product supply or other market conditions, including weather, economic and political factors affecting crude oil and natural gas supply or pricing. For example, weather conditions could damage production or transportation facilities, which could result in decreased supplies of propane, increased supply costs\nChesapeake Utilities Corporation 2021 Form 10-K Page 18\nand higher prices for customers. Such increases in costs can occur rapidly and can negatively affect profitability. There is no assurance that we will be able to pass on propane cost increases fully or immediately, particularly when propane costs increase rapidly. Therefore, average retail sales prices can vary significantly from year-to-year as product costs fluctuate in response to propane, fuel oil, crude oil and natural gas commodity market conditions. In addition, in periods of sustained higher commodity prices, declines in retail sales volumes due to reduced consumption and increased amounts of uncollectible accounts may adversely affect net income.\nRefer to Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk for additional information.\nA substantial disruption or lack of growth in interstate natural gas pipeline transmission and storage capacity or electric transmission capacity may impair our ability to meet customers\u2019 existing and future requirements.\nIn order to meet existing and future customer demands for natural gas and electricity, we must acquire sufficient supplies of natural gas and electricity, interstate pipeline transmission and storage capacity, and electric transmission capacity to serve such requirements. We must contract for reliable and adequate upstream transmission capacity for our distribution systems while considering the dynamics of the interstate pipeline and storage and electric transmission markets, our own on-system resources, as well as the characteristics of our markets. Our financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected if the future availability of these capacities were insufficient to meet future customer demands for natural gas and electricity. Currently, our Florida natural gas operation relies primarily on two pipeline systems, FGT and Peninsula Pipeline, our intrastate pipeline subsidiary for most of its natural gas supply and transmission. Our Florida electric operation secures electricity from external parties. Any continued interruption of service from these suppliers could adversely affect our ability to meet the demands of our customers, which could negatively impact our earnings, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur use of derivative instruments may adversely affect our results of operations.\nFluctuating commodity prices may affect our earnings and financing costs because our propane operations use derivative instruments, including forwards, futures, swaps, puts, and calls, to hedge price risk. While we have risk management policies and operating procedures in place to control our exposure to risk, if we purchase derivative instruments that are not properly matched to our exposure, our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nOur ability to grow our businesses could be adversely affected if we are not successful in making acquisitions or integrating the acquisitions we have completed.\nOne of our strategies is to grow through acquisitions of complementary businesses. Acquisitions involve a number or risks including, but not limited to, the assumption of material liabilities, the diversion of management\u2019s attention from the management of daily operations to the integration of operations, difficulties in the assimilation and retention of employees and difficulties in the assimilation of different cultures and internal controls. Future acquisitions could also result in, among other things, the failure to identify material issues during due diligence, the risk of overpaying for assets, unanticipated capital expenditures, the failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, recording goodwill and other intangible assets at values that ultimately may be subject to impairment charges and fluctuations in quarterly results. There can also be no assurance that our past and future acquisitions will deliver the strategic, financial and operational benefits that we anticipate. The failure to successfully integrate acquisitions could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nAn impairment of goodwill could result in a significant charge to earnings.\nIn accordance with GAAP, goodwill is tested for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. If the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred, we are required to record an impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill and the implied fair value of the goodwill in the period the determination is made. The testing of goodwill for impairment requires us to make significant estimates about our future performance and cash flows, as well as other assumptions. These estimates can be affected by numerous factors, including: future business operating performance, changes in economic conditions and interest rates, regulatory, industry or market conditions, changes in business operations, changes in competition or changes in technologies. Any changes in key assumptions, or actual performance compared with key assumptions, about our business and its future prospects could affect the fair value of one or more business segments, which may result in an impairment charge.\nREGULATORY, LEGAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS\nChesapeake Utilities Corporation 2021 Form 10-K Page 19\nRegulation of our businesses, including changes in the regulatory environment, may adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nThe Delaware, Maryland and Florida PSCs regulate our utility operations in those states. Eastern Shore is regulated by the FERC. The PSCs and the FERC set the rates that we can charge customers for services subject to their regulatory jurisdiction. Our ability to obtain timely rate increases and rate supplements to maintain current rates of return depends on regulatory approvals, and there can be no assurance that our regulated operations will be able to obtain such approvals or maintain currently authorized rates of return. When earnings from our regulated utilities exceed the authorized rate of return, the respective regulatory authority may require us to reduce our rates charged to customers in the future.\nWe may face certain regulatory and financial risks related to pipeline safety legislation.\nWe are subject to a number of legislative proposals at the federal and state level to implement increased oversight over natural gas pipeline operations and facilities to inspect pipeline facilities, upgrade pipeline facilities, or control the impact of a breach of such facilities. Additional operating expenses and capital expenditures may be necessary to remain in compliance. If new legislation is adopted and we incur additional expenses and expenditures, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected, particularly if we are not authorized through the regulatory process to recover from customers some or all of these costs and our authorized rate of return.\nWe are subject to operating and litigation risks that may not be fully covered by insurance.\nOur operations are subject to the operating hazards and risks normally incidental to handling, storing, transporting, transmitting and delivering natural gas, electricity and propane to end users. From time to time, we are a defendant in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. We maintain insurance coverage for our general liabilities in the amount of $52 million, which we believe is reasonable and prudent. However, there can be no assurance that such insurance will be adequate to protect us from all material expenses related to potential future claims for personal injury and property damage or that such levels of insurance will be available in the future at economical prices.\nCosts of compliance with environmental laws may be significant.\nWe are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing environmental quality and pollution control. These evolving laws and regulations may require expenditures over a long period of time to control environmental effects at our current and former operating sites, especially former MGP sites. To date, we have been able to recover, through regulatory rate mechanisms, the costs associated with the remediation of former MGP sites. However, there is no guarantee that we will be able to recover future remediation costs in the same manner or at all. A change in our approved rate mechanisms for recovery of environmental remediation costs at former MGP sites could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nFurther, existing environmental laws and regulations may be revised, or new laws and regulations seeking to protect the environment may be adopted and be applicable to us. Revised or additional laws and regulations could result in additional operating restrictions on our facilities or increased compliance costs, which may not be fully recoverable. Any such increase in compliance costs could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Compliance with these legal obligations requires us to commit capital. If we fail to comply with environmental laws and regulations, even if such failure is caused by factors beyond our control, we may be assessed civil or criminal penalties and fines, which could impact our financial condition and results of operations. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data (see Note 20, Environmental Commitments and Contingencies, in the consolidated financial statements).\nUnanticipated changes in our tax provisions or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability and cash flow.\nWe are subject to income and other taxes in the U.S. and the states in which we operate. Changes in applicable state or U.S. tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application, including the possibility of retroactive effect, could affect our tax expense and profitability. In addition, the final determination of any tax audits or related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Changes in our tax provision or an increase in our tax liabilities, due to changes in applicable law and regulations, the interpretation or application thereof, future changes in the tax rate or a final determination of tax audits or litigation, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur business may be subject in the future to additional regulatory and financial risks associated with global warming and climate change.\nChesapeake Utilities Corporation 2021 Form 10-K Page 20\nThere have been a number of federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives proposed in recent years in an attempt to control or limit the effects of global warming and overall climate change, including greenhouse gas emissions, such as carbon dioxide. The direction of future U.S. climate change regulation is difficult to predict given the potential for policy changes under different Presidential administrations and Congressional leadership. The EPA may or may not continue developing regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Even if federal efforts in this area slow, states, cities and local jurisdictions may continue pursuing climate regulations. Any laws or regulations that may be adopted to restrict or reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could require us to incur additional operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions controls, to obtain emission allowances or to pay emission taxes, and reduce demand for our energy delivery services. Federal, state and local legislative initiatives to implement renewable portfolio standards or to further subsidize the cost of solar, wind and other renewable power sources may change the demand for natural gas. We cannot predict the potential impact that such laws or regulations, if adopted, may have on our future business, financial condition or financial results.\nClimate changes may impact the demand for our services in the future and could result in more frequent and more severe weather events, which ultimately could adversely affect our financial results.\nSignificant climatic change creates physical and financial risks for us. Our customers' energy needs vary with weather conditions, primarily temperature and humidity. For residential customers, heating and cooling represent their largest energy use. To the extent weather conditions may be affected by climate change, customers' energy use could increase or decrease depending on the duration and magnitude of any changes. To the extent that climate change adversely impacts the economic health or weather conditions of our service territories directly, it could adversely impact customer demand or our customers\u2019 ability to pay. Changes in energy use due to weather variations may affect our financial condition through volatility and/or decreased revenues and cash flows. Extreme weather conditions require more system backups and can increase costs and system stresses, including service interruptions. Severe weather impacts our operating territories primarily through thunderstorms, tornadoes, hurricanes, and snow or ice storms. Weather conditions outside of our operating territories could also have an impact on our revenues and cash flows by affecting natural gas prices. To the extent the frequency of extreme weather events increases, this could increase our costs of providing services. We may not be able to pass on the higher costs to our customers or recover all the costs related to mitigating these physical risks. To the extent financial markets view climate change and emissions of greenhouse gases as a financial risk, this could adversely affect our ability to access capital markets or cause us to receive less favorable terms and conditions in future financings. Our business could be affected by the potential for investigations and lawsuits related to or against greenhouse gas emitters based on the claimed connection between greenhouse gas emissions and climate change, which could impact adversely our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe face risks related to widespread public concerns, including the COVID-19 outbreak.\nThe actual or perceived effects of a disease outbreak, epidemic, pandemic or similar widespread public health concern, such as COVID-19, could negatively affect our operations, liquidity, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. The outbreak of COVID-19 has adversely impacted economic activity and conditions worldwide. In particular, efforts to control the spread of COVID-19 led to shutdowns of customer operations and disrupted financial markets and supply chains.\nWe continue to respond to COVID-19 by taking steps to mitigate the impact of its spread and the potential risks to us. We provide a critical service to our customers, which means that it is paramount that we keep our employees who operate our businesses safe and minimize unnecessary risk of the exposure to COVID-19. We continue to operate under our Pandemic Response Plan that dates back to 2007. This plan guides our emergency response, business continuity, and the precautionary measures we have been taking on behalf of our employees, our customers and the communities we serve. We continue to take extra precautions for our employees who work in the field and for employees who continue to work in our facilities, and we have maintained work from home policies where appropriate. We continue to operate under restricted travel plans, minimize movement between offices, utilize virtual, or on-line work, meetings and events, and employ \u201csocial distancing\u201d as directed by the CDC and state and local governments in the areas we serve. We have suspended walk-in customer access to our natural gas, propane and electric offices, and reminded customers of our online and direct mail payment options. We continue to utilize multiple organizational teams and task forces to guide us through ever changing key aspects of this pandemic. We have instituted measures to ensure our supply chains remain open to us; however, there could be global shortages that will impact our maintenance and capital programs that we currently cannot anticipate. We will continue to monitor developments affecting our workforce, our customers and our suppliers, and we will take additional precautions that we determine are necessary in order to mitigate the impacts. We continue to implement measures to ensure that our systems remain functional in order to both serve our operational needs with a remote workforce and keep them running to ensure uninterrupted service to our customers. To date, the crisis has not had a material effect on the Company.\nChesapeake Utilities Corporation 2021 Form 10-K Page 21\nThe extent to which COVID-19 impacts our future results, financial position and liquidity will depend on many factors. At the present time, not all of these factors can be predicted, including new information, which may emerge concerning the severity and duration of the pandemic or any subsequent mutations, the actions mandated by governmental authorities to contain COVID-19 and the availability and timing to identified vaccines, among others.\nAdditional risks and uncertainties not known to us at present, or that we currently deem immaterial, also may affect Chesapeake Utilities. The occurrence of any of these known or unknown risks could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws may delay or prevent a transaction that stockholders would view as favorable.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as Delaware law, contain provisions that could delay, defer or prevent an unsolicited change in control of Chesapeake Utilities, which may negatively affect the market price of our common stock or the ability of stockholders to participate in a transaction in which they might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over the then current market price. These provisions may also prevent changes in management. In addition, our Board of Directors is authorized to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval on such terms as our Board of Directors may determine. Our common stockholders will be subject to, and may be negatively affected by, the rights of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future.", "PERMNO": 23182, "SIC": 4923, "TIC": "CPK"}
