{"cik": "766829", "company": "SJW GROUP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-02-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nInvestors should carefully consider the following risk factors and warnings before making an investment decision. The risks described below are not the only ones facing SJW Group and its subsidiaries. Additional risks that SJW Group and its subsidiaries does not yet know of or that it currently thinks are immaterial may also impair its business operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, SJW Group and its subsidiaries\u2019 business, operating results or financial condition could be materially affected. In such case, the trading price of SJW Group\u2019s common stock could decline and you may lose part or all of your investment. Investors should also refer to the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur business is regulated and may be adversely affected by changes to the regulatory environment.\nOur Water Utility Services are regulated public utilities. The operating revenue of San Jose Water Company and CLWSC is generated primarily from the sale of water at rates authorized by the CPUC and the PUCT, respectively. The CPUC and PUCT set rates that are intended to provide revenues sufficient to recover normal operating expenses, provide funds for replacement of water infrastructure and produce a fair and reasonable return on stockholder common equity. Please refer to Part I, Item 1, \u201cRegulation and Rates\u201d for a discussion of the most recent regulatory proceedings affecting the rates of San Jose Water Company and CLWSC. Consequently, our revenue and operating results depend substantially upon the rates which the CPUC and PUCT authorize.\nIn our applications for rate approvals, we rely upon estimates and forecasts to propose rates for approval by the CPUC or PUCT. No assurance can be given that our estimates and forecasts will be accurate or that the CPUC or PUCT will agree with our estimates and forecasts and approve our proposed rates. To the extent our authorized rates may be too low, revenues may be insufficient to cover Water Utility Services\u2019 operating expenses, capital requirements and SJW Group\u2019s historical dividend rate. In addition, delays in approving rate increases may negatively affect our operating results and our operating cash flows.\nIn addition, policies and regulations promulgated by the regulators govern the recovery of capital expenditures, the treatment of gains from the sale of real utility property, the offset of production and operating costs, the recovery of the cost of debt, the optimal equity structure, and the financial and operational flexibility to engage in non-tariffed operations. If the regulators implement policies and regulations that will not allow San Jose Water Company and CLWSC to accomplish some or all of the items listed above, Water Utility Services\u2019 future operating results may be adversely affected. Further, from time to time, the commissioners at the CPUC and the PUCT may change. Such changes could lead to changes in policies and regulations and there can be no assurance that the resulting changes in policies and regulation, if any, will not adversely affect our operating results or financial condition.\nIf the CPUC disagrees with our calculation of memorandum and balancing accounts, we may be required to make adjustments that could adversely affect our results of operations.\nRecovery of regulatory assets is subject to adjustment by the regulatory agencies and could impact the operating results of Water Utility Services.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles for water utilities include the recognition of regulatory assets and liabilities as permitted by FASB ASC Topic 980-\u201cRegulated Operations.\u201d In accordance with ASC Topic 980, Water Utility Services record deferred costs and credits on the balance sheet as regulatory assets and liabilities when it is probable that these costs and credits will be recovered in the ratemaking process in a period different from when the costs and credits were incurred. Please refer to Note 1 of the \u201cNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d for a summary of net regulatory assets. If the assessment of the probability of recovery in the ratemaking process is incorrect and the applicable ratemaking body determines that a deferred cost is not recoverable through future rate increases, the regulatory assets or liabilities would need to be adjusted, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in water supply, water supply costs or the mix of water supply could adversely affect the operating results and business of Water Utility Services.\nSan Jose Water Company\u2019s supply of water primarily relies upon three main sources: water purchased from SCVWD, surface water from its Santa Cruz Mountains watershed, and pumped underground water. Changes and variations in quantities from each of these three sources affect the overall mix of the water supply, thereby affecting the cost of the water supply. If there is an adverse change to the mix of water supply and San Jose Water Company is not allowed by the CPUC to recover the additional or increased water supply costs, its operating results may be adversely affected.\nSCVWD receives an allotment of water from state and federal water projects. If San Jose Water Company has difficulties obtaining a high quality water supply from SCVWD due to availability, environmental, legal or other restrictions (see also Part I, Item 1, \u201cWater Supply\u201d), it may not be able to fully satisfy customer demand in its service area and its operating results and business may be adversely affected. Additionally, the availability of water from San Jose Water Company\u2019s Santa Cruz Mountains watershed depends on the weather and fluctuates with each season. In a normal year, surface water supply provides 6% to 8% of the total water supply of the system. In a season with little rainfall, such as the record drought conditions in 2015 and most of 2016, water supply from surface water sources may be low, thereby causing San Jose Water Company to increase the amount of water purchased from outside sources at a higher cost than surface water, thus increasing water production expenses. When drought conditions occur, we may be required to rely more heavily on purchased water than surface water, which would increase our costs and adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn addition, San Jose Water Company\u2019s ability to use surface water is subject to regulations regarding water quality and volume limitations. If new regulations are imposed or existing regulations are changed or given new interpretations, the availability of surface water may be materially reduced. A reduction in surface water could result in the need to procure more costly water from other sources, thereby increasing overall water production expenses and adversely affecting our operating results.\nBecause the extraction of water from the groundwater basin and the operation of the water distribution system require a significant amount of energy, increases in energy prices could increase operating expenses of San Jose Water Company. The cost of energy is beyond our control and can change unpredictably and substantially based on load supply and demand. Therefore, San Jose Water Company cannot be certain that it will be able to contain energy costs into the future.\nSan Jose Water Company continues to utilize Pacific Gas & Electric\u2019s time of use rate schedules to minimize its overall energy costs primarily for groundwater pumping. Optimization and energy management efficiency are achieved through the implementation of software applications that control pumps based on demand and cost of energy. An increase in demand or a reduction in the availability of surface water or import water could result in the need to pump more water during peak hours which may adversely affect the operating results of San Jose Water Company.\nSan Jose Water Company has been granted permission by the CPUC to employ certain balancing accounts to track various water supply expenses and revenues. There is no assurance that the CPUC will allow recovery or refund of these balances when submitted by San Jose Water Company.\nCLWSC\u2019s primary water supply is 6,900 acre-feet of water which is pumped from Canyon Lake at three lake intakes or delivered as treated water from GBRA\u2019s Western Canyon Pipeline, in accordance with the terms of its contracts with the GBRA, which are long-term take-or-pay contracts. This supply is supplemented by groundwater pumped from wells. While the contract provides a committed long-term water supply for future demand, CLWSC customers currently do not use the volume of water allowed under the contracts which increases the cost of water for existing customers, and there is no assurance that future demands up to the committed supply volume will occur. Texas faces long-term water supply constraints similar to California as described above and while current water supply exceeds demand, CLWSC may not be able to obtain adequate water supply to meet customer demand or may be required to procure more costly water from other sources. (See also Part I, Item 1, \u201cWater Supply\u201d).\nClimate change may also impact water supply. For example, severity of drought conditions may impact the availability of water to all Water Utility Services and rising sea levels may impact the availability of groundwater available to San Jose Water Company and CLWSC.\nFluctuations in customer demand for water due to seasonality, restrictions of use, weather, and lifestyle can adversely affect operating results.\nWater Utility Services\u2019 operations are seasonal, thus quarterly fluctuation in results of operations may be significant. Rainfall and other weather conditions also affect the operations of Water Utility Services. Water consumption typically increases during the third quarter of each year when weather tends to be warm and dry. In periods of drought, if customers are encouraged or required to conserve water due to a shortage of water supply or restriction of use, revenue tends to be lower. Similarly, in unusually wet periods, water supply tends to be higher and customer demand tends to be lower, again resulting in lower revenues. Furthermore, certain lifestyle choices made by customers can affect demand for water. For example, a significant\nportion of residential water use is for outside irrigation of lawns and landscaping. If there is a decreased desire by customers to maintain landscaping for their homes or restrictions are placed on outside irrigation, residential water demand would decrease, which would result in lower revenues.\nConservation efforts and construction codes, which require the use of low-flow plumbing fixtures, could diminish water consumption and result in reduced revenue. In addition, in time of drought, water conservation may become a regulatory requirement that impacts the water usage of our customers. For example, in response to the severe drought in California in 2015 and 2016, the SCVWD extended their call for 30% conservation and restrictions on outdoor watering of ornamental landscapes two days a week through June 30, 2016. Following the improvement of drought condition in late 2016 and 2017, the SCVWD reduced its conservation target from 30% to 20% and also increased the number of outdoor watering days from two to three effective July 1, 2016 through January 31, 2017. On January 24, 2017, the SCVWD maintained their call for 20% conservation and restrictions on outdoor watering for ornamental landscapes to no more than three days a week, effective February 1, 2017. On June 13, 2017, the SCVWD adopted Resolution 17-43 to encourage making water conservation a way of life in California through recommendations on watering schedules and a call for customers to achieve a 20% reduction in water use as compared to 2013. While the drought has ended SCVWD has maintained a conservation target at 20%. (See also Part I, Item 1, \u201cWater Supply\u201d).\nThe implementation of mandatory conservation measures has resulted and is expected to result in lower water usage by our customers which may adversely affect our results of operation. If the current conservation measures continue, or if new measures are imposed in response to drought conditions in the future, we may experience fluctuations in the timing of or a reduction in customer revenue. Furthermore, while the CPUC approved Water Conservation Memorandum Accounts (\u201cWCMA\u201d) which would allow us to recover revenue reductions due to water conservation activities and certain conservation related costs, such memorandum accounts are subject to a review and approval process by the CPUC, which can be lengthy, and there is no assurance that we will be able to recover in a timely manner all or some of the revenue and costs recorded in the memorandum accounts. If drought conditions ease and the State Water Board and the SCVWD no longer mandate water conservation, the Company may no longer be allowed to recover revenue lost due to continued conservation activities under the WCMA account and would therefore be exposed to differences between actual and authorized usage. This could result in lower revenues.\nA contamination event or other decline in source water quality could affect the water supply of Water Utility Services and therefore adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWater Utility Services is required under environmental regulations to comply with water quality requirements. Through water quality compliance programs, Water Utility Services continually monitors for contamination and pollution of its sources of water. In addition, a watershed management program provides a proactive approach to minimize potential contamination activities. There can be no assurance that Water Utility Services will continue to comply with all applicable water quality requirements. In the event a contamination is detected, Water Utility Services must either commence treatment to remove the contaminant or procure water from an alternative source. Either of these results may be costly, may increase future capital expenditures and there can be no assurance that the regulators would approve a rate increase to enable us to recover the costs arising from such remedies. In addition, we could be held liable for consequences arising from hazardous substances or contamination in our water supplies or other environmental damages. Our insurance policies may not cover or may not be sufficient to cover the costs of these claims.\nWater Utility Services is subject to litigation risks concerning water quality and contamination.\nAlthough Water Utility Services is not a party to any environmental and product-related lawsuits, there is no guarantee that such lawsuits will not occur in the future. If Water Utility Services is subject to an environmental or product-related lawsuit, they might incur significant legal costs and it is uncertain whether it would be able to recover the legal costs from ratepayers or other third parties. Although Water Utility Services has liability insurance coverage for bodily injury and property damage, pollution liability is excluded from this coverage and our excess liability coverage. A pollution liability policy is in place, but is subject to exclusions and limitations. Costs for defense are included within the limit of insurance on the pollution liability policy. In addition, any complaints or lawsuits against us based on water quality and contamination may receive negative publicity that can damage our reputation and adversely affect our business and trading price of our common stock.\nWater Utility Services is subject to possible litigation or regulatory enforcement action concerning water discharges to WOTUS.\nRegulatory actions and fines related to discharges of water to WOTUS against other water utilities have increased in frequency in recent years. If Water Utility Services is subject to a litigation or regulatory enforcement action, it might incur significant costs in fines and restoration efforts, and it is uncertain whether Water Utility Services would be able to recover some or all of such costs from ratepayers or other third parties. In addition, any litigation or regulatory enforcement action against us\nregarding a water discharge and/or resulting environmental impact may receive negative publicity that can damage our reputation and adversely affect our business and the trading price of our common stock.\nNew or more stringent environmental regulations could increase Water Utility Services\u2019 operating costs and affect its business.\nWater Utility Services\u2019 operations are subject to water quality and pollution control regulations issued by the EPA and environmental laws and regulations administered by the respective states and local regulatory agencies.\nNew or more stringent environmental and water quality regulations could increase Water Utility Services\u2019 water quality compliance costs, hamper Water Utility Services\u2019 available water supplies, and increase future capital expenditure.\nUnder the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, Water Utility Services is subject to regulation by the EPA relating to the quality of water it sells and treatment techniques it uses to make the water potable. The EPA promulgates nationally applicable standards, including maximum contaminant levels for drinking water. Additional or more stringent requirements may be adopted by each state. There can be no assurance that Water Utility Services will be able to continue to comply with all water quality requirements.\nWater Utility Services has implemented monitoring activities and installed specific water treatment improvements in order to comply with existing maximum contaminant levels and plan for compliance with future drinking water regulations. However, the EPA and the respective state agencies have continuing authority to issue additional regulations under the Safe Drinking Water Act. New or more stringent environmental standards could be imposed that will raise Water Utility Services\u2019 operating costs, including requirements for increased monitoring, additional treatment of underground water supplies, fluoridation of all supplies, more stringent performance standards for treatment plants and procedures to further reduce levels of disinfection by-products. There are currently limited regulatory mechanisms and procedures available to us for the recovery of such costs and there can be no assurance that such costs will be fully recovered and failure to do so may adversely affect our operating results.\nThe water utility business requires significant capital expenditures that are dependent on our ability to secure appropriate funding. If SJW Group is unable to generate sufficient operating cash flows and obtain sufficient capital or if the rates at which we borrow increase, there would be a negative impact on our results of operations.\nThe water utility business is capital-intensive. Expenditure levels for renewal and modernization of the system will grow at an increasing rate as components reach the end of their useful lives. SJW Group funds capital expenditures through a variety of sources, including cash received from operations, funds received from developers as contributions or advances, borrowings through the lines of credit, and equity or debt financing. We cannot provide any assurance that the historical sources of funds for capital expenditures will continue to be adequate or that the cost of funds will remain at levels permitting us to earn a reasonable rate of return. A significant change in any of the funding sources could impair the ability of Water Utility Services to fund its capital expenditures, which could impact our ability to grow our utility asset base and earnings. Any increase in the cost of capital through higher interest rates or otherwise could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur ability to raise capital through equity or debt may be affected by the economy and condition of the debt and equity markets. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets or deteriorations in the strength of financial institutions could adversely affect SJW Group\u2019s ability to draw on its line of credit, issue long-term debt or sell its equity. In addition, government policies, the state of the credit markets and other factors could result in increased interest rates, which would increase SJW Group\u2019s cost of capital. Furthermore, equity financings may result in dilution to our existing stockholders and debt financings may contain covenants that restrict the actions of SJW Group and its subsidiaries. Our senior note borrowings include certain financial covenants regarding a maximum debt to equity ratio and an interest coverage requirement. In the event the Company exceeds the maximum debt to equity ratio or interest coverage requirement, we may be restricted from issuing future debt. In addition, the pollution control revenue bonds issued on our behalf contain affirmative and negative covenants customary for a loan agreement relating to revenue bonds, including, among other things, certain disclosure obligations, the tax exempt status of the interest on the bonds, and limitations and prohibitions on the transfer of projects funded by the loan proceeds and assignment of the loan agreement. In the event that we violate any of these covenants, an event of default may occur and all amounts due under such bonds may be called by the Trustee, which would have an adverse effect on our business operations and financial conditions.\nWe operate in areas subject to natural disasters or that may be the target of terrorist activities.\nWe operate in areas that are prone to earthquakes, fires and other natural disasters. A significant seismic event in northern California, where the majority of our operations are concentrated, or other natural disaster in northern California or Texas could adversely impact our ability to deliver water to our customers and our costs of operations. A major disaster could damage or destroy substantial capital assets. Our California and Texas based regulators have historically allowed utilities to establish catastrophic event memorandum accounts as a possible mechanism to recover costs. However, we can give no assurance that our regulators, or any other commission would allow any such cost recovery mechanism in the future.\nIn light of the potential threats to the nation\u2019s health and security due to terrorist attacks, we have taken steps to increase security measures at our facilities and heighten employee awareness of threats to our water supply. We have also tightened our security measures regarding the delivery and handling of certain chemicals used in our business. We have and will continue to bear increased costs for security precautions to protect our facilities, operations and supplies. These costs may be significant.\nWhile some of these costs are likely to be recovered in the form of higher rates, there can be no assurance that the CPUC and PUCT will approve a rate increase to recover all or part of such costs and, as a result, our operating results and business may be adversely affected. Further, despite these tightened security measures, we may not be in a position to control the outcome of terrorist events should they occur.\nA failure of our reservoirs, storage tanks, mains or distribution networks could result in losses and damages that may adversely affect our financial condition and reputation.\nWe distribute water through an extensive network of mains and store water in reservoirs and storage tanks located across our service areas. A substantial portion of Water Utility Services distribution system was constructed during the period from 1945 to 1980. A failure of major mains, reservoirs, or tanks could result in injuries and damage to residential and/or commercial property for which we may be responsible, in whole or in part. The failure of major mains, reservoirs or tanks may also result in the need to shut down some facilities or parts of our water distribution network in order to conduct repairs. Such failures and shutdowns may limit our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers and to meet the water delivery requirements prescribed by governmental regulators, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, liquidity and reputation. Any business interruption or other losses might not be covered by insurance policies or be recoverable in rates, and such losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance in the future at acceptable rates.\nWater Utility Services rely on information technology and systems that are key to business operations. A system malfunction, security breach, cyber attacks or other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which could adversely affect business operations.\nInformation technology is key to the operation of Water Utility Services, including but not limited to payroll, general ledger activities, outsourced bill preparation and remittance processing, providing customer service and the use of Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition systems to operate our distribution system. Among other things, system malfunctions, computer viruses and security breaches could prevent us from operating or monitoring our facilities, billing and collecting cash accurately and timely analysis of financial results. In addition, we collect, process, and store sensitive data from our customers and employees, including personally identifiable information, on our networks. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed without our authorization, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen which could result in legal claims or proceedings, violation of privacy laws or damage to our reputation and customer relationships. Our profitability and cash flow could be affected negatively in the event these systems do not operate effectively or are breached. In addition, we may not be able to develop or acquire information technology that is competitive and responsive to the needs of our business, and we may lack sufficient resources to make the necessary upgrades or replacements of our outdated existing technology to allow us to continue to operate at our current level of efficiency.\nSJW Land Company has real estate holdings that are subject to various business and investment risks.\nSJW Land Company owns real estate in two states. The risks in investing directly in real estate vary depending on the investment strategy and investment objective and include the following:\n\u2022\nLiquidity risk-real estate investments are illiquid. The lag time to build or reduce the real estate portfolio is long.\n\u2022\nObsolescence risk-real estate property is location specific. Location obsolescence can occur due to a decline of a particular sub-market or neighborhood. Functional obsolescence can also occur from physical depreciation, wear and tear, and other architectural and physical features which could be curable or incurable.\n\u2022\nMarket and general economic risks-real estate investment is tied to overall domestic economic growth and, therefore, carries market risk which cannot be eliminated by diversification. Generally, all property types benefit from national economic growth, though the benefits range according to local factors, such as local supply and demand and job creation. Because real estate leases are typically staggered and last for multiple years, there is generally a delayed effect in the performance of real estate in relation to the overall economy. This delayed effect can insulate or deteriorate the financial impact to SJW Land Company in a downturn or an improved economic environment.\n\u2022\nConcentration/Credit risk-the risk of a tenant declaring bankruptcy and seeking relief from its contractual rental obligation could affect the income and the financial results of SJW Land Company. This risk is most prevalent in a recessionary environment.\nVacancy rates can climb and market rents can be impacted and weakened by general economic forces, therefore affecting income to SJW Land Company.\nThe value of real estate can decrease materially due to a deflationary market, decline in rental income, market cycle of supply and demand, long lag time in real estate development, legislative and governmental actions, environmental concerns, increases in rates of returns demanded by investors, and fluctuation of interest rates, eroding any unrealized capital appreciation and, potentially, invested capital.\nA decrease in the value of a real estate property or increase in vacancy could result in reduced future cash flows to amounts below the property\u2019s current carrying value and could result in an impairment charge.\nThe success of SJW Land Company\u2019s real estate investment strategy depends largely on ongoing local, state and federal land use development activities and regulations, future economic conditions, the development and fluctuations in the sale of the undeveloped properties, the ability to identify the developer/potential buyer of the available-for-sale real estate, the timing of the transaction, favorable tax law, and the ability to maintain and manage portfolio properties. There is no guarantee that we will be able to execute the strategy successfully and failure to do so may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nThere can be no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends in the future or, if dividends are paid, that they will be in amounts similar to past dividends.\nDividends on our common stock will only be paid if and when declared by our Board of Directors. Our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, applicable regulations and other factors, including the timeliness and adequacy of rate increases, will determine both our ability to pay dividends on common stock and the amount of the dividends declared by our Board of Directors. There can be no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends in the future or, if dividends are paid, that they will be in amounts similar to past dividends.\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile and may be affected by market conditions beyond our control.\nThe trading price of our common stock may fluctuate in the future based on a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control and unrelated to our financial results. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the trading price of our common stock include volatility of the general stock market or the utility index, regulatory developments, public announcement of material development in strategic transactions, including the Merger, general economic conditions and trends, actual or anticipated changes or fluctuations in our results of operations, actual or anticipated changes in the expectations of investors or securities analysts, actual or anticipated developments in our competitors\u2019 businesses or the competitive landscape generally, litigation involving us or our industry, and major catastrophic events or sales of large blocks of our stock. Furthermore, we believe that stockholders invest in public stocks in part because they seek reliable dividend payments. If there is an over supply of stock of public utilities in the market relative to demand by such investors, the trading price of our common stock may decrease. Additionally, if interest rates rise above the dividend yield offered by our common stock, demand for our stock and its trading price may also decrease.\nOur business strategy, which includes acquiring water systems and expanding non-tariffed services, will expose us to new risks which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business strategy focuses on the following:\n(1)\nRegional regulated water utility operations;\n(2)\nRegional non-tariffed water utility related services provided in accordance with the guidelines established by the CPUC in California and the PUCT in Texas; and\n(3)\nOut-of-region water and utility related services.\nAs part of our pursuit of the above three strategic areas, we consider from time to time opportunities to acquire businesses and assets, including the Merger. However, we cannot be certain we will be successful in identifying and consummating any strategic business combination or acquisitions relating to such opportunities. In addition, the execution of our business strategy will expose us to different risks than those associated with the current utility operations. We expect to incur costs in connection with the execution of this strategy and any integration of an acquired business could involve significant costs, the assumption of certain known and unknown liabilities related to the acquired assets, the diversion of management\u2019s time and resources, the potential for a negative impact on SJW Group\u2019s financial position and operating results, entering markets in which SJW Group has no or limited direct prior experience and the potential loss of key employees of any acquired company. Any strategic\ncombination or acquisition we decide to undertake may also impact our ability to finance our business, affect our compliance with regulatory requirements, and impose additional burdens on our operations. Any businesses we acquire may not achieve sales, customer growth and projected profitability that would justify the investment. Any difficulties we encounter in the integration process, including the integration of controls necessary for internal control and financial reporting, could interfere with our operations, reduce our operating margins and adversely affect our internal controls. SJW Group cannot be certain that any transaction will be successful or that it will not materially harm operating results or our financial condition.\nWe must continue to attract and retain qualified technical and managerial personnel in order to succeed.\nOur future success depends largely upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical, operational and financial managers. There is a significant competition for such personnel in our industry. The loss of the services of any member of our management team or the inability to hire and retain experienced management personnel could have an adverse effect on our business, as our management team has knowledge of our industry and customers and would be difficult to replace. We try to ensure that we offer competitive compensation and benefits as well as opportunities for continued development, and we continually strive to recruit and train qualified personnel and retain key employees. There can be no assurance, however, that we will continue to be successful in attracting and retaining the personnel we require to grow and operate profitably.\nAdverse investment returns and other factors may increase our pension costs and pension plan funding requirements.\nA substantial number of our employees are covered by a defined benefit pension plan. Our pension costs and the funded status of the plan are affected by a number of factors including the discount rate, applicable mortality tables, mortality rates of plan participants, investment returns on plan assets, and pension reform legislation. Any change in such factors could result in an increase in future pension costs and an increase in our pension liability, requiring an increase in plan contributions which may adversely affect our financial conditions and results of operations.\nWork stoppages and other labor relations matters could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nAs of December 31, 2018, 235 of our 416 total employees were union employees. Most of our unionized employees are represented by the Utility Workers of America, except certain employees in the engineering department who are represented by the International Union of Operating Engineers.\nWe may experience difficulties and delays in the collective bargaining process to reach suitable agreements with union employees, particularly in light of increasing healthcare and pension costs. In addition, changes in applicable law and regulations could have an adverse effect on management\u2019s negotiating position with the unions. Labor actions, work stoppages or the threat of work stoppages, and our failure to obtain favorable labor contract terms during future negotiations may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nOur charter documents and Delaware law could prevent a takeover that stockholders consider favorable and could also make it more difficult for stockholders to influence our policies or may reduce the rights of stockholders.\nSJW Group\u2019s Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of SJW Group. These provisions could also make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. These provisions include but are not limited to the following:\n\u2022\nAuthorizing Board of Directors to issue \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock;\n\u2022\nProhibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n\u2022\nLimiting the ability of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders to only stockholders holding not less than 20% of outstanding voting power; and\n\u2022\nRequiring advance notification of stockholder nomination of directors and proposals.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by stockholders of SJW Group to replace or remove its current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of the Board of Directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of management. In addition, the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporate Law (\u201cDGCL\u201d) govern SJW Group. These provisions may prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, from merging or combining with us for a certain period of time without the consent of the Board of Directors.\nFurthermore, SJW Group\u2019s Certificate of Incorporation provides that a state or federal court located within Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum (unless the company consents in writing to the selection of an alternate forum) for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of SJW Group, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of SJW Group to the company or its stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising\npursuant to any provision of the DGCL, or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Such \u201cexclusive forum\u201d provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with SJW Group or its directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees.\nRisks Related to the Merger\nWe may not be able to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals to complete the Merger, and even if such approval is obtained, regulatory authorities may impose conditions that could have an adverse effect on us.\nCompletion of the Merger is contingent upon, among other things, the receipt of all required regulatory approvals, including the approvals of PURA and the MPUC. On December 3, 2018, PURA issued a proposed final decision denying the joint application by SJW Group and CTWS for the approval of the Merger. On December 14, 2018 SJW Group and CTWS filed a joint motion with PURA requesting extension of the procedural schedule to reopen the record to consider new evidence supporting the Merger. On January 4, 2019, PURA denied the motion. On January 9, 2019, SJW Group and CTWS withdrew our application before PURA and issued a joint press release announcing that we are continuing to evaluate our regulatory approach in connection with the Merger, including the possibility of submitting a new application to PURA. On January 11, 2019, PURA closed the docket without issuing a final decision. On January 23, 2019, the Maine Water Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of CTWS, filed notice of its intent to voluntarily withdraw its application without prejudice, reserving the right to refile at a later date. After a thorough review conducted by the management and boards of both companies with the support of their respective local Connecticut and Maine regulatory counsel SJW Group and CTWS announced on February 20, 2019 that they intend to file a new merger approval applications with PURA and MPUC. We expect to incur additional expenses in connection with the new applications. We also anticipate a delay in the completion of the Merger as a result of the additional time required for PURA and MPUC to review and issue a decision on the new application, which may take up to 120 days from the date of the filing unless extended. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that PURA and MPUC will approve any new application on a timely basis or at all, and failure of approval would prevent the completion of the Merger. Any uncertainty, delay and denial of regulatory approval for the Merger could adversely affect our business, financial conditions and the price of our stock.\nEven if we are able to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals for the Merger, the terms and conditions of such approvals may impose requirements, limitations or costs, or place restrictions on the conduct of the combined company\u2019s business. We and/or CTWS may be required to comply with conditions imposed by regulatory entities in connection with the Merger, though the Merger Agreement provides for certain limitations with respect to the actions that either company is required to take in connection with such regulatory conditions. There can be no assurance that regulators will not impose conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions or that such conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions will not have the effect of delaying completion of the Merger or imposing additional material costs on or materially limiting the revenues of the combined company following the Merger. Additionally, we cannot provide assurance that any such conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions will not result in the failure of the conditions to the Merger being satisfied, the Merger being delayed or abandoned, or the consummation of the Merger on terms different than those contemplated by the Merger Agreement.\nFailure to complete the Merger as currently contemplated or at all could negatively impact our stock price, business operations and financial results.\nCompletion of the Merger is not assured and is subject to risks, including the risks that approval by governmental entities will not be obtained or that certain other closing conditions will not be satisfied. If the Merger is not completed, or is completed on different terms than as contemplated by the Merger Agreement, our ongoing businesses, financial results and stock price may be adversely affected and we will be subject to several risks, including the following:\n\u25aa\nhaving to pay certain significant costs relating to the Merger without receiving the benefits of the Merger, including, in certain circumstances, payment of a termination fee and an expense reimbursement;\n\u25aa\nthe potential loss of key personnel during the pendency of the Merger as employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company;\n\u25aa\nreputational harm due to the adverse public perception of any failure to successfully complete the Merger;\n\u25aa\nhaving been subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of our business, which may have prevented us from soliciting or making certain dispositions while the Merger was pending;\n\u25aa\nour management having focused on the Merger instead of on conducting its day-to-day business and operational matters and pursuing other opportunities that could have been beneficial to us; and\n\u25aa\nif the Merger is not completed, we are not obligated to repurchase any or all of the shares issued in our recent equity offering and such shares may remain outstanding, which could negatively impact our stock price.\nAny delay in the completion of the Merger, any uncertainty about the completion of the Merger on terms other than those contemplated by the Merger Agreement and any failure to complete the Merger could adversely affect our business, financial results and stock price.\nAny delay in completing the Merger may reduce or eliminate the benefits to be achieved thereunder.\nIn addition to the required regulatory clearances, the Merger is subject to a number of other conditions beyond our control that may prevent, delay or otherwise materially adversely affect its completion. We cannot predict whether and when these other conditions will be satisfied. Furthermore, the requirements for obtaining the required clearances and approvals could delay the completion of the Merger for a significant period of time or prevent it from occurring. Any delay in completing the Merger could cause the combined company to not realize, or to be delayed in realizing, some or all of the benefits expected to result from elimination of duplicative public company and other related costs that we expect to achieve if the Merger is successfully completed within its expected time frame.\nThe CPUC has initiated an investigation into the Merger, which may cause delays in or otherwise adversely affect the Merger, and we may be required to consummate the Merger prior to the CPUC\u2019s issuance of an order with respect to its investigation.\nThe CPUC at its July 12, 2018 meeting approved an OII into the Merger. The order includes investigating the CPUC\u2019s authority over the Merger, whether the Merger is in the public interest; whether the Merger would preserve the CPUC\u2019s jurisdiction over San Jose Water Company and the CPUC\u2019s capacity to effectively regulate utility operations in the State of California; the effect of the Merger on our and CTWS\u2019s employees, shareholders, customers, and communities in which they operate and the State of California; whether the benefits likely exceed any detrimental effects of the Merger; and whether the CPUC should consider conditions or mitigation measures to prevent any adverse consequences which may result from the Merger, and if so, what should be those conditions or measures. The order stated that the CPUC planned to substantially complete the inquiry in a manner sufficiently timely to allow the Merger to go forward by the end of 2018, if appropriate. However, as a result of unexpected delays in the CPUC\u2019s scheduling of a planned public participation hearing, which was held January 31, 2019, the CPUC is now expected to complete its investigation in the second quarter of 2019.\nWe are unable to predict what action, if any, the CPUC will take with respect to the Merger upon the conclusion of the proceeding initiated by the OII and, therefore, no assurance can be given that such action will not delay or prevent completion of the Merger or impose costs on us, which costs may be material and may negate some or all of the benefits that we expect as a result of the Merger. If we or CTWS terminate the Merger Agreement on the grounds that a legal restraint prevents completion of the Merger, and such restraint arises from, is issued by or is in connection with the CPUC, or the CPUC has imposed terms or conditions in connection with the Merger that would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the combined company, then we will be required to reimburse CTWS\u2019s expenses up to $5 million.\nCompletion of the CPUC\u2019s investigation is not a condition to the consummation of the Merger. Accordingly, we may be required to consummate the Merger prior to the CPUC\u2019s issuance of an order with respect to its investigation. In such a circumstance, we may nevertheless be subject to any terms and conditions imposed on us by such an order and to any additional costs associated therewith. Such costs may be material and may negate some or all of the benefits that we expect as a result of the Merger.\nThe Merger Agreement with CTWS may be terminated in certain circumstances, which would result in the benefits of the Merger not being realized.\nEither we or CTWS may terminate the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances, including, if the Merger has not been consummated by May 5, 2019 (unless such date is extended automatically to August 5, 2019 or November 5, 2019 pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement). However, this termination right will not be available to a party if such failure of the Merger to occur on or before such date is the result of a material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Merger Agreement by such party. If we are not able to complete the Merger by the end date, even if we decide not to terminate the Merger Agreement, we may not be able to prevent CTWS from exercising its right to terminate the Merger Agreement.\nIn addition, if the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, CTWS may be required to pay SJW Group a termination fee of $28.1 million. Similarly, if the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, we may be required to pay CTWS a termination fee of $42.5 million or, under certain circumstances, to reimburse CTWS\u2019s expenses up to $5 million. A termination of the Merger Agreement prior to consummation of the Merger may adversely affect our business and stock price, and we will not be able to realize the benefits expected from the Merger.\nWe have broad discretion in the use of the net proceeds to us from the equity offering and may not use them effectively.\nIn December 2018, SJW Group sold an aggregate of 7,762,500 shares of its common stock in an equity offering and received net proceeds of approximately $412.0 million, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by SJW Group.\nSJW Group intends to use the net proceeds from the offering, together with the net proceeds from new debt financing in 2019, to finance the Merger and to pay related fees and expenses. Pending such use, we may invest the net proceeds in investment-grade securities, money-market funds, bank deposit accounts or similar short-term investments. To date, the company has invested the net offering proceeds temporarily in a short-term money market fund. These investments may not yield a favorable return to our investors. If for any reason the Merger does not close, then SJW Group intends to use the proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, which may include acquisitions, share repurchases or debt repayment. SJW Group had no obligation to repurchase any of its shares of common stock that were sold in the offering even if the Merger is not completed.\nWe cannot specify with any certainty the particular uses of the net proceeds that we received from the equity offering, and we may spend or invest these proceeds in a way with which our stockholders disagree. The failure by our management to apply these funds effectively could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nWe will take on substantial additional indebtedness to finance the Merger, which will decrease our business flexibility and increase our borrowing costs.\nIn the event that the Merger is consummated, in addition to the net proceeds we received from the equity offering, we expect to finance the remaining portion of the purchase price of the Merger with net proceeds from up to $435.0 million of debt financing that we may incur (\u201cDebt Financing\u201d), which may include borrowings under a $975.0 million committed bridge facility (\u201cBridge Facility\u201d). Subsequent to the completion of the equity offering, the facility commitment was reduced to $563 million. As a result of the Debt Financing, we will increase our indebtedness substantially as compared to our indebtedness prior to the Merger, and will have indebtedness that will be substantially greater than our indebtedness prior to the Merger. Any financial covenants we agree to in connection with such indebtedness and our increased indebtedness and higher debt-to-equity ratio in comparison to that of our recent historical basis will have the effect, among other things, of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and increasing borrowing costs. In addition, the actual terms and conditions of such indebtedness may not be favorable to us, and as such, could further increase the cost of the Merger, as well as the overall burden of such indebtedness upon SJW Group and our business flexibility. Unfavorable terms in the Debt Financing may also adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe anticipate that the Merger and the related Debt Financing may have an impact on our issuer and issue ratings, potentially in advance of consummation of the Merger. For example, it is possible that the issuer and issue ratings of certain of our subsidiaries, and certain of those entities to be acquired in the Merger, could be lowered. SJW has publicly announced an intention to achieve at least an A- issuer credit rating for the currently unrated SJW Group. We also anticipate that the Debt Financing may have an initial rating which may be equal to or lower than the potential new SJW Group issuer rating given the structural subordination of newly incurred unsecured debt in the Debt Financing. We cannot provide any assurances regarding potential rating agency actions, any changes in outlook from the rating agencies, the timing of any such actions or the level of any initial ratings or any downgrade.\nAn adverse judgment in any litigation challenging the Merger may prevent it from becoming effective or from becoming effective within the expected timeframe.\nOn June 14, 2018, a putative class-action complaint was filed against the members of the CTWS board of directors, SJW and Eric W. Thornburg on behalf of CTWS shareholders in the Connecticut Superior Court in the Judicial District of Middlesex under the caption Dunn v. Benoit, et al., Case No. MMX-CV18-6021536-S (Conn. Super. Ct.). The complaint, as amended on September 18, 2018, alleges that the members of the CTWS board of directors breached their fiduciary duties owed to CTWS shareholders in connection with negotiating the Merger and that CTWS\u2019s preliminary proxy statement, filed with the SEC on August 20, 2018, omits certain material information. The complaint further alleges that SJW Group and Eric W. Thornburg aided and abetted the alleged breaches by the CTWS board of directors. Among other remedies, the action seeks to recover rescissory and other damages and attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.\nAlso, on June 14, 2018, a near-identical putative class-action complaint was filed against the members of the CTWS board of directors, SJW and Eric W. Thornburg on behalf of CTWS shareholders in the Connecticut Superior Court in the Judicial District of Middlesex under the caption Tillotson v. Benoit, et al., Case No. MMX-CV18-6021537-S (Conn. Super. Ct.). The complaint, as amended on September 20, 2018, alleges that members of the CTWS board of directors breached their fiduciary duties owed to CTWS shareholders in connection with negotiating the Merger and that CTWS\u2019s preliminary proxy statement, filed with the SEC on August 20, 2018, omits certain material information. The complaint further alleges that SJW Group and\nEric W. Thornburg aided and abetted the alleged breaches by the CTWS board of directors. Among other remedies, the action seeks to recover recissory and other damages and attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.\nThe parties to the above lawsuits have agreed in principle to settle the lawsuits in exchange for the issuance of additional disclosures by CTWS. Pursuant to the agreements to settle these lawsuits, the plaintiffs have reserved the right to seek a mootness fee from CTWS. The parties moved to stay proceedings, other than fee-related proceedings, until such time as the transaction closes, and the court has granted the parties\u2019 motion to stay. Pursuant to the agreement in principle to settle the litigation, the complaints will be dismissed at such time as the transaction closes.\nAdditional complaints have been filed in connection with the Merger but neither SJW nor any of its officers or directors are named as defendants therein. On October 5, 2018, a complaint was filed against CTWS and members of the CTWS board of directors on behalf of a putative CTWS stockholder in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut under the caption Assad v. Connecticut Water Service, Inc., Case No. 3:18-cv-01664 (D. Conn.). The complaint alleges that the preliminary proxy statement issued in connection with the Merger omitted material information in violation of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Among other remedies, the action seeks an order (1) enjoining the defendants from consummating or closing on the Merger; (2) rescinding the Merger or awarding rescissory damages; (3) directing the defendants to disseminate a corrective proxy statement; (4) declaring that the defendants have violated Sections 14(a) and/or 20(a) of the 1934 Act, as well as Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder; and (5) awarding attorney\u2019s fees and costs. Also, on October 5, 2018, a near-identical putative class-action complaint was filed against CTWS and the members of the CTWS board of directors on behalf of CTWS stockholders in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut under the caption Paskowitz v. Connecticut Water Service, Inc., Case No. 3:18-cv-01663 (D. Conn.). The complaint alleges that CTWS\u2019s preliminary proxy statement issued in connection with the Merger omitted material information in violation of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Among other remedies, the action seeks an order (1) enjoining the defendants from consummating or closing on the Merger; rescinding the Merger or awarding rescissory damages; (3) directing the defendants to disseminate a corrective proxy statement; (4) declaring that the defendants have violated Sections 14(a) and/or 20(a) of the 1934 Act, as well as Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder; and (5) awarding attorney\u2019s fees and costs.\nWhile we believe that the lawsuits are without merit and that the disclosures in CTWS\u2019s preliminary proxy statement comply fully with applicable law, in order to avoid the expense and distraction of litigation, the parties to each of the above-referenced actions entered into agreements in principle to settle and release all claims that were or could have been alleged by the plaintiffs in all of those actions. The settlements provide for the dismissal of the actions subject to, among other things, the supplementation of the preliminary proxy statement with certain additional disclosures.\nOn November 20, 2018, the plaintiffs filed a brief in support of an opening mootness fee demand of $1.5 million for alleged benefits the plaintiffs believe their lawsuit created for CTWS. CTWS intends to vigorously oppose this demand.\nIt is possible that SJW stockholders or CTWS shareholders may file additional lawsuits challenging the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, which may name SJW, the SJW board of directors, CTWS and/or the CTWS board of directors as defendants. The outcome of such lawsuits cannot be assured, including the amount of costs associated with defending these claims or any other liabilities that may be incurred in connection with the litigation of these claims. Whether or not any plaintiff\u2019s claim is successful, this type of litigation may result in significant costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which could adversely affect the operation of SJW\u2019s and CTWS\u2019s business.\nOne of the conditions to the closing of the Merger is the absence of any law or order, decree or judgment by a court, arbitrator or other governmental entity that prevents, makes illegal or prohibits the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Consequently, if SJW stockholders or CTWS shareholders file additional lawsuits challenging the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and a settlement or other resolution is not reached in such lawsuits and the plaintiffs secure injunctive or other relief prohibiting, delaying or otherwise adversely affecting the parties\u2019 ability to complete the Merger, then such injunctive or other relief may prevent the Merger from becoming effective within the expected time frame or at all.\nUncertainties associated within the combined company after the Merger may cause a loss of management personnel and other key employees which could adversely affect the future business and operations of the combined company.\nSJW and CTWS are dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of their respective officers and other key employees to execute their business plans. The combined company\u2019s success after the Merger will depend in part upon the ability of SJW and CTWS to retain key management personnel and other key employees. Current and prospective employees of SJW and CTWS may experience uncertainty about their roles within the combined company following the Merger, which may have an adverse effect on the ability of each of SJW and CTWS to attract or retain key management and other key personnel. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the combined company will be able to attract or retain key management personnel\nand other key employees of SJW and CTWS to the same extent that SJW and CTWS have previously been able to attract or retain their own employees. A failure by SJW, CTWS or, following the completion of the Merger, the combined company to attract, retain and motivate executives and other key employees during the period prior to or after the completion of the Merger could have a negative impact on their respective businesses.\nCompletion of the Merger may trigger change in control or other provisions in certain agreements to which CTWS is a party, which may have an adverse impact on the combined company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nThe completion of the Merger may trigger change in control and other provisions in certain agreements to which CTWS is a party. If we and CTWS are unable to negotiate waivers of those provisions, the counterparties may exercise their rights and remedies under the agreements, potentially terminating the agreements or seeking monetary damages. Even if we and CTWS are able to negotiate waivers, the counterparties may require a fee for such waivers or seek to renegotiate the agreements on terms less favorable to CTWS or the combined company. Any of the foregoing or similar developments may have an adverse impact on the combined company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nWe may not have discovered undisclosed liabilities of CTWS during our due diligence process.\nIn the course of the due diligence review of CTWS that we conducted prior to the execution of the Merger Agreement, we may not have discovered, or may have been unable to quantify, undisclosed liabilities of CTWS and its subsidiaries, and our stockholders may not be indemnified for any of these liabilities. Examples of such undisclosed liabilities may include, but are not limited to, pending or threatened litigation or regulatory matters. Any such undisclosed liabilities could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and on the value of our common stock following the completion of the Merger.\nRisks Related to SJW Group and CTWS as a Combined Company if the Merger is Completed\nThe combined company is expected to incur substantial expenses related to the Merger and the integration of SJW Group and CTWS.\nIf the Merger is completed, the combined company would be expected to incur substantial expenses in connection with the Merger and the integration of SJW Group and CTWS. There will be a large number of processes, policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems at each company that must be integrated, including accounting and finance, payroll, revenue management, commercial operations, risk management and employee benefits. While SJW Group and CTWS have assumed that a certain level of expenses would be incurred, there are many factors beyond our control that could affect the total amount or the timing of the integration expenses. Moreover, many of the expenses that will be incurred are, by their nature, difficult to estimate accurately. These expenses could, particularly in the near term, exceed the benefits that the combined company expects to achieve from the elimination of duplicative public company and other related costs expected from the transaction. These integration expenses likely will result in the combined company taking significant charges against earnings following the completion of the Merger, and the amount and timing of such charges are uncertain at present. Substantial expenses related to the transaction, including fees payable to the companies\u2019 advisors, will also be borne by SJW Group and CTWS even if the Merger is not completed.\nThe Merger will result in changes to the board of directors that may affect the strategy and operations of the combined company.\nIn connection with the consummation of the Merger, we expect that the board of directors of the combined company will be expanded to create additional seats to be filled by CTWS directors to be selected by SJW Group. This new composition of the board of directors may affect the combined company\u2019s business strategy and operating decisions following the completion of the Merger.\nThe Merger will combine two companies that are currently affected by developments in the water utility industry, including changes in regulation. A failure to adapt to the changing regulatory environment after the Merger could adversely affect the stability of the combined company\u2019s earnings.\nBecause SJW Group, CTWS and their respective subsidiaries are regulated in the United States at the federal level and, in the case of SJW Group, in California and Texas, and, in the case of CTWS, Connecticut and Maine, the two companies have been and will continue to be affected by legislative and regulatory developments. After the Merger, the combined company and/or its subsidiaries will be subject in the United States to federal regulation as well as to extensive state regulation in the states in which the combined company will operate. The costs and burdens associated with complying with these regulatory jurisdictions may have an adverse effect on the combined company. Moreover, potential legislative or regulatory changes may create greater risks to the stability of the combined company\u2019s earnings generally.\nThe combined company\u2019s dividend policy is subject to the discretion of its board of directors and may be limited by the combined company\u2019s credit agreements and limitations under the Delaware law.\nAlthough it is currently anticipated that the combined company will pay a regular quarterly dividend following the completion of the Merger, any such determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of the board of directors of the combined company and will be dependent on then-existing conditions, including the company\u2019s financial conditions, earnings, legal requirements, including limitations under Delaware law, restrictions in the combined company\u2019s credit agreements that limit its ability to pay dividends to stockholders and other factors the board of directors of the combined company deems relevant. The board of directors of the combined company may, in its sole discretion, change the amount or frequency of dividends or discontinue the payment of dividends entirely. For those reasons, you may not be able to rely on dividends to receive a return on your investment. Accordingly, realization of a gain on your shares of the combined company common stock received in the Merger may depend on the appreciation of the price of the combined company common stock, which may never occur.\nThe financing arrangements that we will enter into in connection with the Merger may, under certain circumstances, contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly impact the combined company\u2019s ability to operate its business.\nWe intend to incur additional indebtedness in connection with the Merger. We expect that the agreements governing the indebtedness incurred in connection with the Merger may contain covenants that could impose significant operating and financial limitations and restrictions on the combined company following the Merger, including restrictions on the ability to enter particular transactions and engage in other activities that we may believe will be advisable or necessary for the combined company\u2019s business.\nVarious risks, uncertainties and events beyond the combined company\u2019s control could affect its ability to comply with the covenants contained in its debt agreements. Failure to comply with any of the covenants in its existing or future financing agreements could result in a default under those agreements and under other agreements containing cross-default provisions. A default would permit lenders to accelerate the maturity of indebtedness under these agreements and to foreclose upon any collateral securing such indebtedness. Under certain circumstances, the combined company might not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of its obligations. In addition, the limitations imposed by financing agreements on the combined company\u2019s ability to incur additional indebtedness and to take other actions might significantly impair its ability to obtain other financing.", "PERMNO": 54199, "SIC": 4941, "TIC": "SJW"}
