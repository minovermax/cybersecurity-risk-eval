{"cik": "740971", "company": "OLD POINT FINANCIAL CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-30", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nU.S. and international economic conditions and credit markets pose challenges for the Company and could adversely affect the results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. The Company is currently operating in a challenging and uncertain economic environment, both in the local markets it serves and in the broader national and international economies. In addition, uncertainty regarding oil prices, ongoing federal budget negotiations, the implementation of the employer mandate under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and the level of U.S. debt may present challenges to businesses and have a destabilizing effect on financial markets. If the economic recovery continues to be relatively weak or there is further deterioration of national or international economic conditions, the financial condition and operating performance of financial institutions, including the Company, could be adversely affected. Such adverse effects could include a decline in the value of the Company's securities portfolio, and could increase the regulatory scrutiny of financial institutions. Another deterioration of local economic conditions could again lead to declines in real estate values and home sales and increases in the financial stress on borrowers and unemployment rates, all of which could lead to increases in loan delinquencies, problem assets and foreclosures and reductions in loan collateral value. Such a deterioration of local economic conditions could cause the level of loan losses to exceed the level the Company has provided in its allowance for loan losses which, in turn, would reduce the Company's earnings.\nGlobal credit market conditions could return to being disrupted and volatile. Although the Company remains well capitalized and has not suffered any liquidity issues, the cost and availability of funds may be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets. Any future turbulence in the U.S. and international markets and economy may adversely affect the Company's liquidity, financial condition and profitability.\n- 7 -\nThe Company is subject to interest rate risk and variations in interest rates may negatively affect its financial performance. The Company's profitability depends in substantial part on its net interest margin, which is the difference between the rates received on loans and investments and the rates paid for deposits and other sources of funds. The net interest margin depends on many factors that are partly or completely outside of the Company's control, including competition; federal economic, monetary and fiscal policies; and economic conditions. Changes in interest rates affect operating performance and financial condition. The Company tries to minimize its exposure to interest rate risk, but it is unable to completely eliminate this risk. Because of the differences in the maturities and repricing characteristics of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, changes in interest rates do not produce equivalent changes in interest income earned on interest-earning assets and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Accordingly, fluctuations in interest rates could adversely affect the Company's net interest margin and, in turn, its profitability. In addition, the FRB's Federal Open Market Committee has stated that it will keep the federal funds target rate at 0%-0.25% until economic and labor conditions (as indicated by the unemployment rate) improve, which which may be later in 2015. Even though such a continuance of accommodative monetary policy could allow the Company to continue to reprice fixed-rate deposits at lower rates, continued low interest rates could put further pressure on the yields generated by the Company's loan portfolio and on the Company's net interest margin. At December 31, 2014, based on scheduled maturities only, the Company's balance sheet was liability sensitive at the one-year time frame and, as a result, its net interest margin will tend to decrease in a rising interest rate environment and increase in a declining interest rate environment. However, when using decay rates to simulate maturities for non-maturing deposits, the Company's balance sheet as of December 31, 2014 is asset sensitive at the one-year time frame. When the Company is asset sensitive, the net interest margin should rise if rates rise and should fall if rates fall. For additional details, See \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Interest Sensitivity\" in Item 7 of this report on Form 10-K.\nIn addition, any substantial and prolonged increase in market interest rates could reduce the Company's customers' desire to borrow money or adversely affect their ability to repay their outstanding loans by increasing their credit costs. Interest rate changes could also affect the fair value of the Company's financial assets and liabilities. Accordingly, changes in levels of market interest rates could materially and adversely affect the Company's net interest margin, asset quality, loan origination volume, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company's accounting estimates and risk management processes rely on analytical and forecasting models. Processes that management uses to measure the fair value of financial instruments, as well as the processes used to estimate the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures on the Company's earnings performance and liquidity, depend upon the use of analytical and forecasting models. These models reflect assumptions that may not be accurate, particularly in times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances. Even if these assumptions are accurate, the models may prove to be inadequate or inaccurate because of other flaws in their design or their implementation.\nIf the models that management uses for interest rate risk and asset-liability management are inadequate, the Company may incur increased or unexpected losses upon changes in market interest rates or other market measures and may be unable to maintain sufficient liquidity. If the models that management uses to measure the fair value of financial instruments are inadequate, the fair value of such financial instruments may fluctuate unexpectedly or may not accurately reflect what the Company could realize upon sale or settlement of such financial instruments. Any such failure in management's analytical or forecasting models could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWeaknesses in the commercial real estate markets could negatively affect the Company's financial performance. At December 31, 2014, the Company had $296.6 million, or 55.34%, of total loans concentrated in commercial real estate, which includes, for purposes of this concentration, all construction loans, loans secured by multifamily residential properties, loans secured by farmland and loans secured by nonfarm, nonresidential properties. Commercial real estate loans carry risks associated with the successful operation of a business if the properties are owner occupied. If the properties are non-owner occupied, the repayment of these loans may be dependent upon the profitability and cash flow from rent receipts. Weak economic conditions may impair a borrower's business operations, slow the execution of new leases and lead to turnover in existing leases. The combination of these factors could result in deterioration in value of some of the Company's loans. The deterioration of one or more of the Company's significant commercial real estate loans could cause a significant increase in nonaccrual loans. An increase in nonaccrual loans could result in a loss of interest income from those loans, an increase in the provision for loan losses, and an increase in loan charge-offs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial performance.\nThe Company is subject to losses resulting from fraudulent and negligent acts on the part of loan applicants, correspondents or other third parties. The Company relies heavily upon information supplied by third parties, including the information contained in credit applications, employment and income documentation, property appraisals, title information, and equipment pricing and valuation, in deciding which loans to originate, as well as in establishing the terms of those loans. If any of the information upon which the Company relies during the loan approval process is misrepresented, either fraudulently or inadvertently, and the misrepresentation is not detected prior to asset funding, the value of the asset may be significantly lower than expected, the Company may fund a loan that it would not have otherwise funded or the Company may fund a loan on terms that it would not have otherwise extended. Whether a misrepresentation is made by the applicant or by another third party, the Company generally bears the risk of loss associated with the misrepresentation. In addition, a loan subject to a material misrepresentation is typically unsellable or subject to repurchase if it is sold prior to detection of the misrepresentation. The sources of the misrepresentation are often difficult to locate, and it may be difficult to recover any monetary loss the Company may suffer.\n- 8 -\nThe Company's profitability depends significantly on local economic conditions and changes in the federal government's military or defense spending may negatively affect the local economy. The Company's success depends primarily on the general economic conditions of the markets in which the Company operates. Unlike larger financial institutions that are more geographically diversified, the Company provides banking and financial services to customers primarily in the Hampton Roads MSA. The local economic conditions in this area have a significant impact on the demand for loans, the ability of the borrowers to repay these loans and the value of the collateral securing these loans. A significant decline in general economic conditions, caused by inflation, recession, acts of terrorism, an outbreak of hostilities or other international or domestic calamities, unemployment or other factors beyond the Company's control could impact these local economic conditions.\nIn addition, Hampton Roads is home to one of the largest military installations in the world and one of the largest concentrations of Department of Defense personnel in the United States. Some of the Company's customers may be particularly sensitive to the level of federal government spending on the military or on defense-related products. Federal spending is affected by numerous factors, including macroeconomic conditions, presidential administration priorities, and the ability of the federal government to enact relevant appropriations bills and other legislation. Any of these factors could result in future cuts to military or defense spending or increased uncertainty about federal spending, which could have a severe negative impact on individuals and businesses in the Company's primary service area. Any related increase in unemployment rates or reduction in business development activities in the Company's primary service area could lead to increases in loan delinquencies, problem assets and foreclosures and reductions in loan collateral value, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's operating results and financial condition.\nThe downgrade of the U.S. credit rating could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and liquidity. Standard & Poor's lowered its long term sovereign credit rating on the United States of America from AAA to AA+ in 2011. A further downgrade or a downgrade by other rating agencies could have a material adverse impact on financial markets and economic conditions in the United States and worldwide, which may lead to among other things, increased volatility and illiquidity in the capital markets, declines in consumer confidence, increased unemployment levels, and declines in the value of U.S. Treasury securities and securities guaranteed by the U.S. government, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nDeclines in loans outstanding could have a material adverse impact on the Company's operating results and financial condition. If quality loan demand does not continue to increase and the Company's loan portfolio begins to decline, the Company expects that excess liquidity will be invested in marketable securities. Because loans typically yield higher returns than the Company's securities portfolio, a shift towards investments in the Company's asset mix would likely result in an overall reduction in net interest income and the net interest margin. The principal source of earnings for the Company is net interest income, and as discussed above, the Company's net interest margin is a major determinant of the Company's profitability. The effects of a reduction in net interest income and the net interest margin may be exacerbated by the intense competition for quality loans in the Company's primary service area and by rate reductions on loans currently held in the portfolio. As a result, a reduction in loans could have a material adverse effect on the Company's operating results and financial condition.\nThe Company's substantial dependence on dividends from its subsidiaries may prevent it from paying dividends to its stockholders and adversely affect its business, results of operations or financial condition. The Company is a separate legal entity from its subsidiaries and does not have significant operations or revenues of its own. The Company substantially depends on dividends from its subsidiaries to pay dividends to stockholders and to pay its operating expenses. The availability of dividends from the subsidiaries is limited by various statutes and regulations. It is possible, depending upon the financial condition of the Company and other factors, that the Comptroller could assert that payment of dividends by the subsidiaries is an unsafe or unsound practice. In the event the subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends to the Company, the Company may not be able to pay dividends on the Company's common stock, service debt or pay operating expenses. Consequently, the inability to receive dividends from the subsidiaries could adversely affect the Company's financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and limit stockholders' return, if any, to capital appreciation.\nThe small-to-medium size businesses the Company targets may have fewer financial resources to weather a downturn in the economy, which could materially harm operating results. The Company targets individual and small-to-medium size business customers. Small-to-medium-size businesses frequently have smaller market shares than their competitors, may be more vulnerable to economic downturns, often need substantial additional capital to expand and compete and may experience significant volatility in operating results. Any one or more of these factors may impair a borrower's ability to repay a loan. In addition, the success of a small-to-medium size business often depends on the management talents and efforts of one or a small group of persons, and the death, disability or resignation of one or more of these persons could have a material adverse impact on the business and its ability to repay a loan. Economic downturns and other events that negatively impact businesses in the Company's primary service area could cause the Company to incur substantial credit losses that could negatively affect its results of operations and financial condition.\n- 9 -\nA decline in real estate values has caused the Company to experience losses in selling foreclosed properties, and the continuation of this decline could cause a significant portion of the Company's loan portfolio to be under-collateralized and lead to additional future losses. The market value of real estate, particularly real estate held for investment, can fluctuate significantly in a short period of time as a result of market conditions in the geographic area in which the real estate is located. The Company's business activities and credit exposures are primarily concentrated in the Hampton Roads MSA. If the value of the real estate serving as collateral for the Company's loan portfolio were to decline materially, a significant part of the loan portfolio could become under-collateralized. If the loans that are collateralized by real estate become troubled during a time when market conditions are declining or have declined, then, in the event of foreclosure, the Company may not be able to realize the dollar value from the collateral that it anticipated at the time of originating the loan. If real estate values decline, it is also more likely that the Company would be required to increase the allowance for loan losses, which could also adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn recent years, the market value of real estate declined considerably and has failed to materially recover, leaving the Company with certain loans that are under-collateralized. Some of these loans have become troubled and have been foreclosed upon, and the Company was unable to realize the expected value of the collateral. Due to these events, the Company has established a valuation reserve for other real estate owned (OREO), including foreclosed assets, which negatively affects the Company's earnings in periods in which a provision is added to the valuation reserve.\nIn addition, the decline in real estate values and recent inability to materially recover has caused and could continue to cause the Company to experience losses when selling OREOs. These factors have had an adverse affect on operating results.\nThe ownership of foreclosed property exposes the Company to significant costs, some of which are uncertain. When the Company has to foreclose upon real property held as collateral, the Company is exposed to the risks inherent in the ownership of real estate. The amount that the Company may realize after a loan default is dependent upon factors outside of the Company's control, including environmental cleanup liability, especially with regard to non-residential real estate, neighborhood values, real estate tax rates, operating or maintenance expenses of the foreclosed properties, and supply of and demand for properties. Significant costs associated with the ownership of real estate may materially and adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition, cash flows and result of operations.\nThe allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual losses. A significant source of risk arises from the possibility that losses could be sustained because borrowers, guarantors, and related parties may fail to perform in accordance with the terms of their loans and leases. Like all financial institutions, the Company maintains an allowance for loan losses to provide for loan defaults and non-performance. The allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual loan losses. In addition, future provisions for loan losses could materially and adversely affect, and have in recent years materially and adversely affected, the Company's operating results.\nThe allowance for loan losses is determined by analyzing historical loan losses, current trends in delinquencies and charge-offs, plans for problem loan resolutions, changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio and industry information. Also included in management's estimates for loan losses are considerations with respect to the impact of economic events, the outcome of which are uncertain. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and judgment. The amount of future losses is susceptible to changes in economic and other conditions, including changes in interest rates, that may be beyond the Company's control and these future losses may exceed current estimates. If management's assumptions prove to be incorrect or if the Company experiences significant loan losses in future periods, the current level of the allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual loan losses and adjustments may be necessary to allow for different economic conditions or adverse developments in the loan portfolio. In addition, federal regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, review the Company's loans and allowance for loan losses. While management believes that the Company's allowance is adequate to cover current losses, the Company cannot assure investors that it will not need to increase the allowance or that regulators will not require the allowance to be increased. Either of these occurrences could materially and adversely affect earnings and profitability.\nMarket risk affects the earnings of Trust. The fee structure of Trust is generally based upon the market value of accounts under administration. Most of these accounts are invested in equities of publicly traded companies and debt obligations of both government agencies and publicly traded companies. As such, fluctuations in the equity and debt markets in general have had a direct impact upon the earnings of Trust.\nThe Company may be adversely affected by changes in government monetary policy. As a bank holding company, the Company's business is affected by the monetary policies established by the FRB, which regulates the national money supply in order to mitigate recessionary and inflationary pressures. In setting its policy, the FRB may utilize techniques such as the following:\n\u00b7\nEngaging in open market transactions in U.S. Government securities;\n\u00b7\nSetting the discount rate on member bank borrowings; and\n\u00b7\nDetermining reserve requirements.\n- 10 -\nThese techniques, all of which are outside the Company's control, may have an adverse effect on deposit levels, net interest margin, loan demand or the Company's business and operations.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act has increased the Company's regulatory compliance burden and associated costs, placed restrictions on certain products and services and limited its future capital raising strategies. A wide range of regulatory initiatives directed at the financial services industry has been proposed and/or implemented in recent years. One of those initiatives, the Dodd-Frank Act, was enacted in 2010 and mandates significant changes in the financial regulatory landscape that will impact all financial institutions, including the Company and the Bank. Since its enactment, the Dodd-Frank Act has increased the Company's regulatory compliance burden and its continuing implementation will likely continue to increase the Company's regulatory compliance burden and may have a material adverse effect on the Company, by increasing the costs associated with regulatory examinations and compliance measures.\nOne of the Dodd-Frank Act's significant regulatory changes is the creation of the CFPB, a financial consumer protection agency that has the authority to impose new regulations and include its examiners in routine regulatory examinations conducted by the Comptroller. The CFPB may reshape the consumer financial laws through rulemaking and enforcement of the Dodd-Frank Act's prohibitions against unfair, deceptive and abusive business practices, which may directly impact the business operations of financial institutions offering consumer financial products or services, including the Company and the Bank. This agency's broad rulemaking authority includes identifying practices or acts that are unfair, deceptive or abusive in connection with any consumer financial transaction or consumer financial product or service. Although the CFPB generally has jurisdiction over banks with $10 billion or more in assets, rules, regulations and policies issued by the CFPB may also apply to the Company, the Bank and/or Trust through the adoption of such policies and best practices by the FRB, Comptroller and FDIC. The full costs and limitations related to this additional regulatory agency and the limitations and restrictions that may be placed upon the Company with respect to its consumer product and service offerings have yet to be determined. However, these costs, limitations and restrictions may have a material impact on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act also increases regulatory supervision and examination of bank holding companies and their banking and non-banking subsidiaries. These and other regulations included in the Dodd-Frank Act could increase the Company's regulatory compliance burden and costs, restrict the financial products and services the Bank can offer to its customers and restrict the Company's ability to generate revenues from non-banking operations. The Dodd-Frank Act imposes more stringent capital requirements on bank holding companies, which could limit the Company's future capital strategies.\nThe Basel III Final Rules will require higher levels of capital and liquidity, which could adversely affect the Company's net income and return on equity. The capital adequacy and liquidity guidelines applicable to the Company and the Bank under the Basel III Final Rules began to be phased-in beginning in 2015. The Basel III Final Rules, when fully-phased in, will require the Company and the Bank to maintain substantially more capital as a result of higher minimum capital levels and more demanding regulatory capital risk-weightings and calculations. The changes to the standardized calculations of risk-weighted assets are complex and may create enormous compliance burdens for the Company and the Bank. The Basel III Final Rules will require the Company and the Bank to substantially change the manner in which they collect and report information to calculate risk-weighted assets, and may increase dramatically risk-weighted assets as a result of applying higher risk-weightings to many types of loans and securities. As a result, the Company and the Bank may be forced to limit originations of certain types of commercial and mortgage loans, thereby reducing the amount of credit available to borrowers and limiting opportunities to earn interest income from the loan portfolio, which may have a detrimental impact on the Company's net income.\nIf the Company were to require additional capital as a result of the Basel III Final Rules, it could be required to access the capital markets on short notice and in relatively weak economic conditions, which could result in raising capital that significantly dilutes existing shareholders. Additionally, the Company may be forced to limit banking operations and activities, and growth of loan portfolios and interest income, to focus on retention of earnings to improve capital levels. Higher capital levels may also lower the Company's return on equity.\nThe repeal of federal prohibitions on payment of interest on demand deposits could increase interest expense. As part of the Dodd-Frank Act, the prohibition on the ability of financial institutions to pay interest on commercial demand deposit accounts was repealed. As a result, beginning in 2011, financial institutions could begin offering interest on demand deposits. Although the Company cannot be certain what interest rates other institutions may offer, the Company expects the impact of offering interest on demand deposits to remain minimal as long as the low interest rate environment continues. When interest rates begin to increase, however, the Company's interest expense may increase and the net interest margin may decline, which could adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDeposit insurance premiums could increase in the future, which may adversely affect future financial performance. The FDIC insures deposits at FDIC insured financial institutions, including the Bank. The FDIC charges insured financial institutions premiums to maintain the DIF at a certain level. Economic conditions since 2008 have increased the rate of bank failures and expectations for further bank failures, requiring the FDIC to make payments for insured deposits from the DIF and prepare for future payments from the DIF.\n- 11 -\nDuring 2009, the FDIC imposed a special deposit insurance assessment on all institutions which it regulates, including the Bank. This special assessment was imposed due to the need to replenish the DIF, as a result of increased bank failures and expected future bank failures. In addition, the FDIC required regulated institutions to prepay their fourth quarter 2009, and estimates of their 2010, 2011 and 2012 assessments in December 2009. Any similar, additional measures taken by the FDIC to maintain or replenish the DIF may have an adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nIn 2011, the FDIC adopted final rules to implement changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act with respect to the FDIC assessment rules. A depository institution's deposit insurance assessment is now calculated based on the institution's total assets less tangible equity, rather than the previous base of total deposits. These changes did not increase the Company's FDIC insurance assessments for comparable asset and deposit levels. However, if the Bank's asset size increases or the FDIC takes other actions to replenish the DIF, the Bank's FDIC insurance premiums could increase, which could have an adverse affect on the Company's results of operations.\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation which could adversely affect them. The Company is subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local governmental authorities and is subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing requirements and restrictions on part or all of operations, including those referenced above. Regulations adopted by these agencies, which are generally intended to protect depositors and customers rather than to benefit stockholders, govern a comprehensive range of matters including, without limitation, ownership and control of the Company's shares, acquisition of other companies and businesses, permissible activities that the Company and its subsidiaries may engage in, maintenance of adequate capital levels and other aspects of operations. These regulations could limit the Company's growth by restricting certain of its activities. The laws, rules and regulations applicable to the Company are subject to regular modification and change. Regulatory changes could subject the Company to more demanding regulatory compliance requirements which could affect the Company in unpredictable and adverse ways. Such changes could subject the Company to additional costs, limit the types of financial services and products it may offer and/or increase the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services and products, among other things. Failure to comply with laws, regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties and/or damage to the Company's reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. Legislation and regulatory initiatives containing wide-ranging proposals for altering the structure, regulation and competitive relationship of financial institutions are introduced regularly. The Company cannot predict in what form or whether a proposed statute or regulation will be adopted or the extent to which such adoption may affect its business.\nThe Company is dependent on key personnel and the loss of one or more of those key personnel could harm its business. The banking business in Virginia, and in the Company's primary service area in the Hampton Roads MSA, is highly competitive and dominated by a relatively small number of large banks. Competition for qualified employees and personnel in the banking industry is intense and there are a limited number of qualified persons with knowledge of and experience in the Virginia community banking industry. The Company's success depends to a significant degree upon its ability to attract and retain qualified management, loan origination, administrative, marketing and technical personnel and upon the continued contributions of and customer relationships developed by management and personnel. In particular, the Company's success is highly dependent upon the capabilities of its senior executive management. The Company believes that its management team, comprised of individuals who have worked in the banking industry for many years, is integral to implementing the Company's business plan. The Company has not entered into employment agreements with any of its executive management employees, and the loss of the services of one or more of them could harm the Company's business.\nThe Company's future success depends on its ability to compete effectively in the highly competitive financial services industry. The Company faces substantial competition in all phases of its operations from a variety of different competitors. Growth and success depends on the Company's ability to compete effectively in this highly competitive financial services environment. Many competitors offer products and services that are not offered by the Company, and many have substantially greater resources, name recognition and market presence that benefit them in attracting business. In addition, larger competitors may be able to price loans and deposits more aggressively and may have larger lending limits that would allow them to serve the credit needs of larger customers. Some of the financial services organizations with which the Company competes are not subject to the same degree of regulation as is imposed on bank holding companies and federally insured national banks. As a result, these non-bank competitors have certain advantages over the Company in accessing funding and in providing various services. The financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation. Failure to compete effectively to attract new and retain current customers in the Company's markets could cause it to lose market share, slow its growth rate and may have an adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company may not be able to compete effectively without the appropriate use of current technology. The use of technology in the financial services market, including the banking industry, evolves frequently. The Company may be unable to attract and maintain banking relationships with certain customers if it does not offer appropriate technology-driven products and services. In addition to better serving customers, the effective use of technology may increase efficiency and reduce costs. The Company may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products or services or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers. As a result, the Company's ability to compete effectively may be impaired, which could lead to a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\n- 12 -\nSystem failures, interruptions, breaches of security, or the failure of a third-party provider to perform its obligations could adversely impact the Company's business operations and financial condition. Communications and information systems are essential to the conduct of the Company's businesses, as such systems are used to manage customer relationships, general ledger, deposits and loans. While the Company has established policies and procedures to prevent or limit the impact of systems failures, interruptions and security breaches, the Company's information, security, and other systems may stop operating properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors, including events beyond the Company's control, such as sudden increases in customer transaction volume, electrical or telecommunications outages, natural disasters, and cyber-attacks. Information security risks have increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of hackers, activists and other external parties. The Company may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent rapidly evolving types of cyber-attacks. In addition, any compromise of the security systems could deter customers from using the Bank's website and online banking service, both of which involve the transmission of confidential information. Although the Company and the Bank rely on commonly used security and processing systems to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect the secure transmission of data, these precautions may not protect the systems from compromises or breaches of security, which would adversely affect the Company's results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, the Company outsources certain data processing to certain third-party providers. Accordingly, the Company's operations are exposed to risk that these third-party providers will not perform in accordance with the contracted arrangements under service agreements. If the third-party providers encounter difficulties, or if the Company has difficulty in communicating with them, the Company's ability to adequately process and account for customer transactions could be affected, and the Company's business operations could be adversely impacted. Further, a breach of a third-party provider's technology may cause loss to the Company's customers. Threats to information security also exist in the processing of customer information through various other vendors and their personnel.\nThe occurrence of any systems failure, interruption or breach of security, or the failure of a third-party provider to perform its obligations, could expose the Company to risks of data loss or data misuse, could damage the Company's reputation and result in a loss of customers and business, could subject it to additional regulatory scrutiny or could expose it to civil litigation, possible financial liability and costly response measures. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\nNegative public opinion could damage the Company's reputation and adversely impact the Company's business, financial condition and results of operation. Reputation risk, or the risk to the Company's business, financial condition and results of operation from negative public opinion, is inherent in the financial services industry. Negative public opinion can result from actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including lending practices and corporate governance, and from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities. Negative public opinion could adversely affect the Company's ability to keep and attract customers and employees, could expose it to litigation and regulatory action, and could adversely affect its access to the capital markets. Damage to the Company's reputation could adversely affect deposits and loans and otherwise negatively affect the Company's business, financial condition and results of operation.\nThe Company may need to raise additional capital in the future and such capital may not be available when needed or at all. The Company may need to raise additional capital in the future to provide it with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet its commitments and business needs, particularly if its asset quality or earnings were to deteriorate significantly. Economic conditions and the loss of confidence in financial institutions may increase the Company's cost of funding and limit access to certain customary sources of capital, including inter-bank borrowings, repurchase agreements and borrowings from the Federal Reserve Bank's discount window. The Company's ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on, among other things, conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside of the Company's control, and the Company's financial performance.\nThe Company cannot assure that such capital will be available on acceptable terms or at all. Any occurrence that may limit the Company's access to the capital markets, such as a decline in the confidence of debt purchasers, depositors of the Bank or counterparties participating in the capital markets, or a downgrade of the parent company or the Bank's ratings, may adversely affect the Company's capital costs and its ability to raise capital and, in turn, its liquidity. Moreover, if the Company needs to raise capital in the future, it may have to do so when many other financial institutions are also seeking to raise capital and would have to compete with those institutions for investors. An inability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on the Company's liquidity, business, financial condition and results of operations.\n- 13 -\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are subject to operational risk, which could adversely affect business, financial condition and results of operation. The Company and its subsidiaries, like all businesses, are subject to operational risk, including the risk of loss resulting from human error, fraud or unauthorized transactions due to inadequate or failed internal processes and systems, and external events that are wholly or partially beyond the Company's control (including, for example, computer viruses or electrical or telecommunications outages). Operational risk also encompasses compliance (legal) risk, which is the risk of loss from violations of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules, regulations, prescribed practices or ethical standards. The Company and its subsidiaries have established a system of internal controls to address these risks, but there are inherent limitations to such risk management strategies as there may exist, or develop in the future, risks that are not anticipated, identified or monitored. Any losses resulting from operational risk could take the form of explicit charges, increased operational costs, litigation costs, harm to reputation or forgone opportunities, any and all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 88183, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "OPOF"}
