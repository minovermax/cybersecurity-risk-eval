{"cik": "717605", "company": "HEXCEL CORP /DE/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-09", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should consider carefully the following risk factors and all other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the documents we incorporate by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. While we believe we have identified and discussed below the material risks affecting our business, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know or that we do not currently believe to be material that may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of\noperations or cash flows in the future, and may require significant management time and attention. You should not interpret the disclosure of any risk factor to imply that the risk has not already materialized.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nOur business has been and will continue to be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and difficult to predict.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has created significant uncertainty and economic disruption and has negatively affected the business and results of operations for the Company. Given the ongoing and dynamic nature of the pandemic, we cannot reasonably estimate the full extent of the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, and there is no guarantee our efforts to address the adverse impacts of COVID-19 will be effective.\nWhile all of our manufacturing sites are currently in operation, during 2020 and 2021 we reduced or furloughed certain operations in response to government measures, employee welfare concerns and the impact of COVID-19 on the global demand and supply chain. Our manufacturing operations may be further adversely affected by impacts from COVID-19, including, the reimplementation of previously lifted measures or imposition of new measures, such as the mandatory vaccination measures in the United States and other locations in which we operate, further decreases in demand and/or deeper supply chain disruptions, shortages in necessary raw materials and resulting cost inflation, and health and availability of essential onsite personnel. While subject to ongoing legal challenge, the U.S. government through executive order and other regulatory action, has attempted to implement mandatory vaccination and other workforce safety measures related to COVID-19 applicable to our business that could materially impact our operations, and vaccine mandates may also be implemented in other jurisdictions in which we operate. Any inability to meet our customers\u2019 needs due to any of the foregoing could negatively impact our business and reputation.\nWe are heavily dependent on sales to customers in the aerospace industry, which has been materially negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Travel restrictions, as well as changes in the propensity for the general public to travel by air as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, have caused reductions in demand for commercial aircraft, which has had an adverse impact on our sales and operating results and may continue to do so for an extended period of time. While we remain unable to predict the magnitude and duration of such impact, the further loss of, or significant reduction in, purchases by Airbus or Boeing will materially impair our business, operating results, prospects, and financial conditions.\nFurthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in market volatility, which previously caused a significant decline in our stock price, subjecting us to increased takeover risk, impaired our ability to declare dividends or other distributions and conduct share buybacks, which may impact our ability to comply with the covenants contained in the agreements that govern our indebtedness and raise additional funds when and as needed. We may also incur additional costs to remedy damages caused by COVID-19 related business disruptions, performance delays or interruptions, which could lead to additional charges, impairments, and other adverse financial impacts.\nWe cannot predict at this time the full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will adversely impact our business, results, and financial condition, which will depend on many factors that are currently not known. These include, among others, (i) the duration, scope and severity of the pandemic; (ii) the effectiveness of the actions taken to contain the virus or treat its impact; (iii) the extent of further disruption to the manufacturing of and demand for our products and our ability to adjust our production schedules to align with changing demand; (iv) the effectiveness of our past and any potential future restructuring actions; and (v) the extent to which global economic and operating conditions, including air travel and business spending, return to their pre-pandemic levels.\nIn addition to the foregoing, many of the risk factors disclosed herein have been, and we anticipate will continue to be further, heightened or exacerbated by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nRisks Related to Our Strategy\nThe markets in which we operate can be cyclical, and downturns in them may adversely affect the results of our operations.\nSome of the markets in which we operate have been, to varying degrees, cyclical and have experienced downturns. A downturn in these markets could occur at any time as a result of events that are industry specific, such as aircraft production slowdown resulting from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on air travel, the Boeing 737 MAX grounding or regulatory scrutiny of the Boeing 787, or macroeconomic, such as an economic downturn. Any deterioration in any of the cyclical markets we serve could adversely affect our financial performance and operating results, as occurred during 2020 and 2021 with respect to the Commercial Aerospace industry.\nDuring both 2020 and 2021, due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Commercial Aerospace, we experienced a material decrease in demand, resulting in order cancellations and deferrals from our Commercial Aerospace customers, which resulted in decreased sales for our Commercial Aerospace products and reduced operating income for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. To the extent there are any further significant deferrals, cancellations, or reductions in demand results in decreased aircraft build rates, including as a result of the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, it would have a further negative impact on sales for our Commercial Aerospace products and as a result reduce our operating income. Approximately 50% of our sales for 2021 were derived from sales to the Commercial Aerospace industry. Reductions in demand for commercial aircraft or a delay in deliveries could result from many factors, including delays in the startup or ramp-up of new programs, suspension or discontinuation of current commercial aircraft programs, changes in the propensity for the general public to travel by air (including as a result of terrorist events and any subsequent military response or a public health crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic), a significant change in the cost of aviation fuel, a change in technology resulting in the use of alternative materials, environmental concerns (including climate change), consolidation and liquidation of airlines, availability of funding for new aircraft purchases or leases, inventory corrections or disruptions throughout the supply chain and slower macroeconomic growth. Although U.S. domestic air travel has increased during 2021, international travel has not yet begun to recover at the same pace. Furthermore, as companies and employees become accustomed to working remotely, business travel and the associated flight hours may not reach pre-pandemic levels.\nAt different times, both Airbus and Boeing have experienced various delays in the start and ramp up of several aircraft programs. In the past, these have delayed our expected growth, or our effective utilization of capacity installed for such growth. Future delays, or production cuts arising from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, future pandemics or other macro-economic factors in these or other major new customer programs could similarly impact our results.\nIn addition, our customers continue to emphasize the need for cost reduction or other improvements in contract terms throughout the supply chain. In response to these pressures, we may be required to accept increased risk or face the prospects of margin compression on some products in the future. Where possible, we seek to offset or mitigate the impact of such pressures through productivity and performance improvements, cost index contractual provisions, hedging and other actions.\nA significant decline in business with Airbus, Boeing, or other significant customers could materially impact our business, operating results, prospects, and financial condition.\nWe have concentrated customers in the Commercial Aerospace and the Space & Defense markets. In the Commercial Aerospace market, approximately 82%, and in the Space & Defense market, approximately 22%, of our 2021 sales were made to Airbus and Boeing and their related subcontractors. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, approximately 33% and 33% of our total consolidated sales, respectively, were to Airbus, and its related subcontractors and approximately 16% and 19% of our total consolidated sales, respectively, were to Boeing and its related subcontractors. Significant changes in the demand for our customers\u2019 end products, program delays, the share of their requirements that is awarded to us or changes in the design or materials used to construct their products could result in a significant loss of business with these customers. The loss of, or significant reduction in, purchases by Airbus or Boeing or any of our other significant customers could materially impair our business, operating results, prospects and financial condition. The level of purchases and product mix demanded by our customers is often affected by events beyond their control, including general economic conditions, demand for their products, conditions in the airline industry, disruptions in deliveries, business disruptions, strikes and other factors, including the previous grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX by the Federal Aviation Administration and other regulators and the regulatory scrutiny of the Boeing 787 causing production delays, and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on air travel and general economic conditions. Further delays in the production ramp-up of the Boeing 737 MAX or the Boeing 787, and the continued impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nReductions in space and defense spending could result in a decline in our sales.\nSpace and defense production that has occurred in recent years may not be sustained, individual programs important to Hexcel may be cancelled, production may not continue to grow and the increased demand for composite-intensive programs may not continue. In addition, the production of military aircraft depends upon defense budgets and the related demand for defense and related equipment. Approximately 33% of our sales in 2021 were to the Space & Defense market, of which approximately 79% were related to military programs in the United States and other countries. In addition to normal business risks, our indirect supply of products to the U.S. government is subject to unique risks largely beyond our control. U.S. Department of Defense budgets could be negatively impacted by several factors, including, but not limited to, a change in defense spending policy as a result of the current political environment or otherwise, the U.S. government\u2019s budget deficits, spending priorities (e.g., allocating more spending to combat the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic), increased defense regulatory requirements resulting in additional expenses, the cost of sustaining the U.S. military presence internationally and possible political pressure to reduce military spending, each of which could cause the U.S. Department of Defense budget to remain unchanged or to decline.\nIf we fail to comply with government procurement laws and regulations, we could lose business and be liable for various penalties or sanctions.\nWe must comply with laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration, and performance of U.S. government contracts, including the government security requirements and additional government export control laws and regulations, as well as certain cybersecurity certifications and other cybersecurity requirements. These regulations and other requirements regularly evolve, and new laws, regulations or procurement requirements or changes to current ones (including, for example, regulations related to cybersecurity and related certification requirements for us and our partners, privacy, information protection, cost accounting, recovery of employee compensation costs, counterfeit parts, pensions, anti-human trafficking, specialty metals, conflict minerals and use of certain non-U.S. equipment and materials) could significantly increase our costs and risks and reduce our profitability. In complying with these laws and regulations, we may incur significant costs, and non-compliance may result in the imposition of fines and penalties, including contractual damages. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations or if a government audit, review, or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil penalties, criminal penalties, or administrative sanctions or suspension or debarment from contracting with the U.S. government.\nIf we are unable to develop new products on a timely basis, it could adversely affect our business and prospects.\nWe believe that our future success depends, in part, on our ability to develop, on a timely basis, technologically advanced products that meet or exceed current industry standards, including developing products with an improved environmental footprint. Although we believe we have certain technological and other advantages over our competitors, maintaining such advantages will require us to continue investing in research and development and sales and marketing. There can be no assurance that we will be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain such competitive advantages or that we can recover major research and development expenses.\nAcquisitions, divestitures, mergers, business combinations or joint ventures may entail certain operational and financial risks.\nOver the past several years, we have completed strategic acquisitions of complementary manufacturing companies, as well as strategic investments in companies. We expect to continue to explore complementary mergers, acquisitions, investments and joint ventures and may also pursue divestures of business lines or investments that do not fit with our core strategy. We may also engage in further vertical integration. We may face competition for attractive targets and may not be able to acquire potential targets at prices acceptable to us, if at all. In addition, these types of transactions may require significant liquidity, which may not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all.\nWe cannot provide any assurance that we will realize the intended benefits from any such transactions. The process of integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require additional financial resources and attention from management that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of our existing operations. Even if successfully integrated, the acquired business may not achieve the results we expect or produce expected benefits in the time frame planned.\nRisks Related to Our Operations\nOur operations would be adversely affected by a shortage of trained personnel or work stoppages.\nOur business has historically been dependent on a highly trained workforce because of the complex nature of our products. Furthermore, as of December 31, 2021, approximately 30% of employees in the United States and the majority of those in Europe were represented by collective bargaining agreements. During 2020 and 2021, we furloughed or eliminated a significant portion of our skilled workforce as a result of the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic had on our customer demand. If the demand for trained personnel returns to pre-COVID-19 levels, and we are unable to quickly reassemble our workforce and subsequently retain a sufficient number of trained personnel, including as a result of any applicable vaccination mandate, or we experience a significant or prolonged work stoppage in such an environment, our ability to secure new business and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOur ability to attract, retain and motivate key employees is vital to our success.\nOur success, competitiveness and ability to execute on our global strategies and maintain a culture of innovation depend in large part on our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified employees and leaders with expertise and capabilities, representing diverse backgrounds and experiences. Achieving this objective may be difficult due to many factors, including fluctuations in global economic and industry conditions, management changes, increasing local and global competition for talent, particularly due to the increase in remote working opportunities resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, the availability of qualified employees, restructuring and alignment activities (including workforce reductions), and the attractiveness of our compensation and benefit programs. If we are unable to attract, retain and motivate qualified employees and leaders, we may be unable to fully capitalize on current and new market opportunities, which could adversely impact our business and results of operations. The loss or retirement of employees presents particular challenges to the extent they involve the departure of knowledgeable and experienced employees and\nthe resulting need to identify and train existing or new candidates to perform necessary functions, and ineffective succession planning could result in unexpected costs, reduced productivity, and/or difficulties with respect to internal processes and controls. There is also the risk that we are unable to achieve our diversity, equity and inclusion objectives or, more broadly, to meet sustainability goals increasingly required by our stockholders, employees and other stakeholders. If we are unable to attract and retain a qualified and diverse workforce, we may be unable to maintain our competitive position and our future success could be materially adversely affected.\nWe have engaged in restructuring and alignment activities from time to time and there can be no assurance that our efforts will have the intended effects.\nFrom time to time, we have responded to changes in our industry and the markets we serve, or other changes in our business, by restructuring or aligning our operations, including actions taken during 2020 and 2021 as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the closure of our Windsor, Colorado wind energy prepreg production facility in 2020. Due to necessary cost reduction measures or changes in the industry and markets in which we compete, we may decide to implement additional restructuring or alignment activities in the future, such as closing plants, idling certain equipment or operations, or making additions, reductions or other changes to our management or workforce. These restructuring and/or alignment activities generally result in charges and expenditures that may adversely affect our financial results for one or more periods. Restructuring and/or alignment activities can also create unanticipated consequences, such as instability or distraction among our workforce, and we cannot provide any assurance that any restructuring or alignment efforts that we undertake will be successful. A variety of risks could cause us not to realize expected cost savings, including, among others: (a) higher than expected severance costs related to headcount reductions; (b) higher than expected costs of closing plants; (c) incurring costs to hire new employees or delays or difficulty hiring the employees needed; and (d) delays in the anticipated timing of activities related to our cost-saving plan. If we are unable to align our operations in light of evolving market conditions, it could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nA decrease in supply, interruptions at key facilities or an increase in cost of raw materials could result in a material decline in our profitability.\nOur profitability depends largely on the price and continuity of the supply of raw materials, which may be supplied through a sole source or a limited number of sources. We purchase large volumes of raw materials, such as epoxy and phenolic resins, acrylonitrile, carbon fiber, fiberglass yarn, aramid paper and, to a lesser extent, aluminum foil. Any restrictions on the supply, or an increase in the cost, including any impact of inflation or resulting from tariffs, of our raw materials could significantly reduce our profit margins. Efforts to mitigate restrictions on the supply or price increases of these raw materials by long-term purchase agreements, productivity improvements, hedging or by flowing through cost increases to our customers may not be successful. During 2021, as a result of the challenges created by global transportation issues, the COVID-19 pandemic and market volatility, we experienced minor supply disruptions and anticipate that supply disruptions and material shortages may continue. While we have not experienced materially significant issues in the purchase of key raw materials, we continue to monitor the availability (including transportation) and price of raw materials on a regular basis, as well as any potential impact on our operations.\nThe occurrence of material operational problems or interruptions, including but not limited to, as a result of the failure of key equipment, a quality or financial failure of a sole source or major supplier, the effects of natural disasters or climate change-related events, the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or other public health crises, ongoing supply chain disruptions and supply shortages, the inability to install, staff and/or qualify necessary capacity, political or social unrest, the failure to achieve planned manufacturing improvements or other causes, or any other inability to meet customer requirements, may have a material adverse effect on the productivity and profitability of a particular manufacturing facility, and could have a material effect on the Company as a whole. In addition, the increasing focus on reducing energy usage and improving the environmental impact and sustainability associated with manufacturing operations, including through legislation or government regulations, may increase our costs and could impact production if we are required to implement certain environmental or sustainability measures at our facilities.\nWe have substantial international operations subject to uncertainties which could affect our operating results.\nWe believe that revenue from sales outside the U.S. will continue to account for a material portion of our total revenue for the foreseeable future. In 2021, 48% of our production and 59% of our customer sales occurred outside of the United States. Additionally, we have invested significant resources in our international operations, and we intend to continue to make such investments in the future. Our international operations are subject to numerous risks, including: (a) general economic, political, legal, social and health conditions in the countries where we operate may have an adverse effect on our operations in those countries or not be favorable to our growth strategy, such as the impact of a public health crisis, including the COVID-19 pandemic, or social unrest on employees and the global economy or the impact of inflation, as well as changes in existing and expected rates of inflation, which may vary across the jurisdictions in which we do business; (b) the difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through some foreign legal systems; (c) foreign customers may have longer payment cycles than customers in the United States; (d) the cost of compliance with international trade laws of all of the countries in which we do business, including export control laws, relating to sales and purchases\nof goods and equipment and transfers of technology; (e) loss of sales to international customers, including those located in China and Russia, as a result of more stringent trade control laws in the United States; (f) tax rates may vary and foreign earnings may be subject to withholding requirements or the imposition of exchange controls or other restrictions; (g) governments may adopt regulations or take other actions that would have a direct or indirect adverse impact on our business and market opportunities, including, but not limited to, resulting from tariffs and other trade restrictions imposed by the United States, China and other jurisdictions; and (h) the potential difficulty in enforcing our intellectual property rights in some foreign countries, and the potential for the intellectual property rights of others to affect our ability to sell products in certain markets. Any one of these could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. With respect to tariffs, implementation of new tariff schemes by various governments, such as those implemented by the United States and China in recent years, could potentially increase the costs of our materials, increase our cost of production, and ultimately increase the landed cost of our products sold from one country into another country.\nFluctuations in currency exchange rates may influence the profitability and cash flows of our business. For example, most of our European operations sell a majority of the products they produce in U.S. dollars, yet the labor, overhead costs and portions of material costs incurred in the manufacture of those products are primarily denominated in Euros, British pound sterling or U.S. dollars. As a result, the local currency margins of goods manufactured with costs denominated in local currency, yet sold in U.S. dollars, will vary with fluctuations in currency exchange rates, reducing when the U.S. dollar weakens against the Euro and British pound sterling. In addition, the reported U.S. dollar value of the local currency financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries will vary with fluctuations in currency exchange rates. While we enter into currency hedge agreements to mitigate these types of fluctuations, we cannot remove all fluctuations or hedge all exposures, and our earnings are impacted by changes in currency exchange rates.\nWe currently do not have political risk insurance in the countries in which we conduct business. While we carefully consider these risks when evaluating our international operations, we cannot provide assurance that we will not be materially adversely affected as a result of such risks.\nWe could be adversely affected by environmental and safety requirements.\nOur operations require the handling, use, storage, transport and disposal of certain regulated materials and wastes. As a result, we are subject to various laws and regulations pertaining to pollution and protection of the environment, health, and safety. These requirements govern, among other things, emissions to air, discharge to waters, the generation, handling, storage, transport, treatment and disposal of regulated materials and waste, and remediation of contaminated sites. We have made, and will continue to make, capital and other expenditures in order to comply with these laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and could become more stringent in the future.\nWe have been named as a \u201cpotentially responsible party\u201d under Superfund or similar state laws at our former and current sites requiring clean up. These laws generally impose liability for costs to investigate and remediate contamination without regard to fault. Under certain circumstances, liability may be joint and several, resulting in one responsible party being held responsible for the entire cleanup obligation. Liability may also include damages to natural resources. We have incurred and likely will continue to incur expenses to investigate and clean up certain of our existing and former facilities, for which we believe we have adequate reserves. The ongoing operation of our manufacturing plants also entails environmental risks, and we may incur material costs or liabilities in the future that could adversely affect us. Although most of our properties have been the subject of environmental site assessments, there can be no assurance that all potential instances of soil and groundwater contamination have been identified, even at those sites where assessments have been conducted. Accordingly, we may discover previously unknown environmental conditions and the cost of remediating such conditions may be material. See \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d below and Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe may also be required to comply with evolving environmental, health and safety laws, regulations or requirements that may be adopted or imposed in the future or to address newly discovered information or conditions that require a response. In particular, climate change is receiving increased attention worldwide, which presents both risks and opportunities for our businesses as legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions increase. Our manufacturing plants use energy, including electricity and natural gas, and some of our plants emit amounts of greenhouse gases that may in the future be affected by these legislative and regulatory efforts. Potential consequences could include increased energy, transportation and raw material costs and may require us to make additional investments in our facilities and equipment, increase our expenditures or limit our ability to grow. Failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in fines and could affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We could also face increased costs related to defending and resolving legal claims and other litigation related to climate change and the alleged impact of our operations on climate change.\nIn addition to regulatory compliance, growing customer environmental and sustainability requirements, including procurement policies that include social and environmental responsibility provisions or requirements that their suppliers are required comply with,\nas well as sustainability goals that we have adopted, could cause us to alter our manufacturing, operations or equipment processes, and incur substantial expense to meet these requirements. The failure to comply with such customer requirements, or similar types of requests, could adversely affect our relationships with some customers, which in turn could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, our reputation could be damaged if we or others in our industry do not act, or are perceived not to act, responsibly with respect to our impact on the environment, or if we fail to achieve our sustainability goals, which could limit our ability to grow and otherwise adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur business and operations may be adversely affected by cybersecurity breaches or other information technology system or network intrusions.\nWe depend heavily on information technology and computerized systems to communicate and operate effectively. We store sensitive data, including proprietary business information, intellectual property and confidential employee or other personal data, on our servers and databases. In addition to traditional information technology systems, we leverage cloud-based systems, where data is stored and exchanged with external third-party vendors. From time to time, we experience cyberattacks on our information technology systems, including vendor-hosted systems. Attempts by others to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems have become more sophisticated and could be material. These attempts, which could be related to industrial or foreign government espionage, activism, or other motivations, include attempting to covertly introducing malware to our systems, performing reconnaissance, impersonating authorized users, and stealing, corrupting, or restricting our access to data, among other activities. We continue to update our infrastructure, security tools, employee training and processes to protect against security incidents, including both external and internal threats, and to prevent their occurrence or recurrence. While Company personnel have been tasked to detect and investigate such incidents, future cybersecurity attacks could still occur and may lead to potential data corruption or loss of data and exposure of proprietary and confidential information, disruptions in critical systems and theft of data, funds, or intellectual property. In addition, we face increased information technology security and fraud risks due to our increased reliance on working remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which may create additional information security vulnerabilities and/or magnify the impact of any disruption in information technology systems. The unauthorized use of our intellectual property and/or confidential business information could harm our competitive position and reputation, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business. An intrusion may also cause operational stoppages or result in fines, penalties, litigation or governmental investigations and proceedings, diminished competitive advantages through reputational damages and increased operational costs. Further, cybersecurity and data protection laws and regulations continue to evolve, and are increasingly demanding, both in the U.S. and globally, which adds compliance complexity and may increase our costs of compliance and expose us to litigation, monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions or fines in one or more jurisdictions. Additionally, we have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, additional costs to comply with our customers\u2019, including the U.S. government\u2019s, increased cybersecurity protections and standards.\nWe operate our business in regions subject to natural disasters and other severe weather events and any disruption to our business resulting from such events will adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.\nWe operate, and rely on suppliers who operate, in regions subject to natural disasters and other severe weather events. In addition, extreme weather events and changing weather patterns present physical risks on existing infrastructure that may become more frequent or more severe as a result of factors related to climate change. We have in the past and will continue in the future to assess potential manufacturing risks related to climate change, including risk of exposure to significant rainfall, flooding, hurricane or tornado events within our supply chain. We previously determined that we have a small percentage of suppliers who manufacture in vulnerable locations, which may impact distribution of raw materials to our operations, although we have taken actions to mitigate the potential impact where possible. We also have two sites in the southeast United States, a region vulnerable to severe weather events (i.e., hurricanes, tornadoes and floods), that are associated with excess warming. Although preventative measures may help to mitigate damage, any disaster could adversely affect our ability to conduct business, including disrupting our supply of raw materials, damaging our manufacturing facilities or otherwise affecting production, transportation and delivery of our products or affect demand for our products, and the insurance we maintain may not be adequate to cover our losses resulting from any business interruption resulting from a natural disaster or other severe weather events. Any future disruptions to our operations, as a result of a natural disaster or severe weather event could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business could be negatively impacted by sustainability/environmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) matters and/or our reporting of such matters.\nThere is an increasing focus from certain investors, customers, employees, and other stakeholders concerning sustainability/ESG matters, and an increasing number of investors are requiring companies to disclose corporate sustainability/ESG policies, practices and metrics. Our customers may require us to implement sustainability/ESG responsibility procedures or standards before they continue to\ndo business with us. Additionally, we may face reputational challenges in the event that our sustainability/ESG responsibility procedures or standards do not meet the standards set by certain constituencies.\nIn addition, from time to time, we communicate certain initiatives or goals regarding sustainability/ESG matters. Although we intend to meet these commitments, we may be required to expend significant resources to do so, which could increase our operational costs. Further, there can be no assurance of the extent to which any of our commitments will be achieved, if at all; we could fail, or be perceived to fail, in our achievement of such initiatives or goals, or we could fail in fully and accurately reporting our progress on such initiatives and goals. In addition, we could be criticized for the scope of such initiatives or goals or perceived as not acting responsibly in connection with these matters. Any such matters could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nWe cannot make any guarantees with respect to payment of dividends on, or repurchases of, our common stock.\nIn connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, in April 2020, we suspended our dividend payments and stock repurchases. In addition, in January 2021, we entered into an amendment to our Facility (as defined below) that limits our ability to engage in share repurchases and cash dividends through and including March 31, 2022. Our board of directors regularly evaluates our capital allocation strategy and dividend policy, and determined to declare our first quarterly dividend since the first quarter of 2020 on January 26, 2022. Any future determination to pay, maintain or increase cash dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon, among other factors, our results of operations, financial condition, capital requirements and contractual or legal restrictions, including the requirements of the Facility and other financing agreements to which we may be a party. No assurance can be given that cash dividends will be declared and paid at historical levels or at all.\nOur share repurchase program does not have an expiration date, and we are not obligated to repurchase a specified number or dollar value of shares, on any particular timetable or at all. There can be no assurance that we will repurchase stock at favorable prices. As described above, activity under this program has been suspended, and there can be no assurance whether or when activity will resume. If resumed, the repurchase program may be suspended or terminated at any time and, even if fully implemented, may not enhance long-term stockholder value. The program, and any purchases under the program, may also be impacted by proposed SEC rules relating to share repurchases.\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for certain legal actions between us and our stockholders, which could discourage lawsuits against the Company and our directors and officers.\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide to the fullest extent permitted by law that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, employees or agents to us or our stockholders, any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \u201cDGCL\u201d) or our restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, or amended and restated bylaws, or any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine of the State of Delaware.\nTo the fullest extent permitted by law, this exclusive forum provision applies to state and federal law claims, including claims under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, although the Company will not be deemed to have waived its compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. The enforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies\u2019 organizational documents has been challenged in legal proceedings, and it is possible that, in connection with claims arising under federal securities laws or otherwise, a court could find the exclusive forum provision contained in the amended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable.\nThis exclusive forum provision may limit the ability of our stockholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such stockholders find favorable for disputes with the Company or our directors or officers, which may discourage such lawsuits against the Company and our directors and officers. Alternatively, if a court were to find this exclusive forum provision inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings described above, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nCertain provisions of our charter, bylaws, and of the DGCL have anti-takeover effects and could delay, discourage, defer or prevent a tender offer or takeover attempt that a stockholder might consider to be in the stockholders\u2019 best interests.\nCertain provisions of our charter and bylaws and the DGCL may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control if our board of directors determines that such changes in control are not in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. Such provisions include, among other things, those that:\n\u2022prohibit stockholders from taking action by written consent and do not permit stockholders to call a special meeting;\n\u2022authorize the board of directors, without further action by the stockholders, to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series, and with respect to each series, to fix the number of shares constituting that series, and establish the rights and terms of that series;\n\u2022establish advance notice procedures for stockholders to submit proposals and nominations of candidates for election to the board of directors to be brought before a stockholders meeting;\n\u2022allow our directors to establish the size of the board of directors (so long as the board of directors consists of at least three and no more than fifteen directors) and fill vacancies on the board of directors created by an increase in the number of directors (subject to the rights of the holders of any series of preferred stock to elect additional directors under specified circumstances);\n\u2022do not provide stockholders cumulative voting rights with respect to director elections;\n\u2022provide that the bylaws may be amended by the board of directors without stockholder approval, to the extent permitted by law; and\n\u2022do not opt out of Section 203 of the DGCL, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in a \u201cbusiness combination\u201d with any interested stockholder (generally speaking, a stockholder who holds 15% or more of our voting stock) for three years from the date such stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, unless certain conditions are met.\nThese provisions may delay or discourage transactions involving an actual or potential change in the Company\u2019s control or change in the board of directors or management, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares of common stock or transactions that our stockholders might otherwise deem to be in their best interests. Accordingly, these provisions could adversely affect the price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 61567, "SIC": 2821, "TIC": "HXL"}
