{"cik": "1575515", "company": "Sprouts Farmers Market, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-24", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nCertain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, or prospects and cause the value of our common stock to decline.\nMarket and Other External Risks\nThe coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has disrupted our business and could negatively impact our financial condition.\nThe unprecedented global outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) that began in the first quarter of 2020 has disrupted our business and could continue to do so for the foreseeable future until the impact of the pandemic subsides.\nOur operations have generally stabilized since the onset of the crisis; however, the COVID-19 pandemic has strained our entire supply chain, store operations and merchandising functions. We have encountered varying degrees of difficulties and delays in obtaining certain products from our distributors, delivering products to our stores and adequately staffing our stores and distribution centers. If we are unable to continue to source, transport and stock products in our stores or to maintain adequate staffing levels in our stores and distribution centers due to disruptions caused by the COVID-19 crisis, we will be unable to maintain inventory levels and continue to operate our stores at levels to meet customer demand. Further, if we do not identify and source appropriate products in response to our customers\u2019 evolving needs as the COVID-19 crisis evolves, we may lose existing customers and fail to attract new customers, which could cause our sales to decrease, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, significant costs to support our front-line store team members, including expenses for added labor, store bonuses, government-mandated wage increases, enhanced benefits and safety measures. If, as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are unable to continue to provide our team members with appropriate compensation and protective measures, we may be unable to retain current or attract new team members to perform necessary functions within our stores and engage with our customers. There is no assurance we will be able to hire sufficient numbers of individuals to meet our needs. In addition, nearly all of our store support team members remain in a remote work environment in an effort to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Our failure to provide appropriate technological resources and maintain adequate safeguards around our remote work environment could result in loss of productivity and usage errors by our team members or the loss or compromise of confidential customer, team member or company data. In addition, the remote work environment may increase certain risks to our business, including phishing and other cybersecurity attacks.\nWe have experienced instances of our team members contracting COVID-19 that have generally tracked national trends, and in response, we follow CDC and other health authority guidelines to report positive test results and reduce further transmission. Any widespread transmission of COVID-19 among our team members within a particular store or geographical area might necessitate that we temporarily close impacted stores, which may negatively affect our business and financial condition, as well as the perception of our company. Further, if individuals believe they have contracted COVID-19 in our stores or believe that we have not taken appropriate precautionary measures to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, we may be subject to costly and time-consuming litigation.\t\nMeasures taken by governmental authorities to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, including vaccine and testing mandates, may cause additional costs and disruptions in workforce availability. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has required and may continue to require us to make controversial decisions and recommendations about precautionary measures such as facial coverings, vaccinations and testing that could impact our results, including by impacting our brand, team member retention and satisfaction, and the willingness of customers to visit our stores.\nAlthough our grocery store operations are generally deemed \u201cessential\u201d operations by federal, state and local authorities, any reimplementation of reduced operating hours and restrictions on the number of customers allowed in our stores at a given time to promote social distancing could negatively impact store traffic. Failure to comply with any governmental regulations promulgated in response to the COVID-19 crisis could result in costly litigation, enforcement actions and penalties. Store traffic may further decline as customers shop less frequently, choose other retail or online outlets to minimize potential exposure to COVID-19 or return to restaurants and other outlets to purchase and consume food as state economies have reopened. We have incurred incremental ecommerce fees from pre-pandemic levels as more customers adopt our digital solutions.\nThe full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business and financial condition will largely depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the pandemic, emergence of variants and the actions necessary to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact.\nSupply chain disruptions have delayed our store growth plans.\nDue to continued difficulties in obtaining necessary equipment from third parties due to supply chain delays complicated by the COVID-19 pandemic, seven of our planned new store-openings in the fourth quarter of 2021 were delayed until 2022. We may continue to experience delays in our new store openings until disruptions to the global supply chain have been resolved, the timing of which is uncertain.\nGeneral economic conditions that impact consumer spending or result in competitive responses could adversely affect our business.\nThe retail food business is sensitive to changes in general economic conditions. In addition to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, recessionary economic cycles, increases in interest rates, higher prices for commodities, fuel and other energy, inflation, high levels of unemployment and consumer debt, depressed home values, high tax rates, tariffs and other macroeconomic factors that affect consumer spending and confidence or buying habits may materially adversely affect the demand for products we sell in our stores. As a result, consumers may be more cautious and could shift their spending to lower-priced competition, such as warehouse membership clubs, dollar stores, online retailers or extreme value formats, which could have a material and adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nIn addition, prolonged inflation or deflation can impact our business. Food inflation, when combined with reduced consumer spending, could also reduce sales, gross profit margins and comparable store sales. As a result, our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Food deflation across multiple categories, particularly in produce and proteins, could also reduce sales growth and earnings if our competitors react by lowering their retail pricing and expanding their promotional activities, which can lead to retail deflation higher than cost deflation that could reduce our sales, gross profit margins and comparable store sales.\nOur failure to compete successfully in our competitive industry may adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nWe operate in the competitive retail food industry. Our competitors include supermarkets, natural food stores, mass or discount retailers, warehouse membership clubs, online retailers and specialty stores, as well as restaurants and home delivery and home meal solution providers. These businesses compete with us for products, customers and locations. We compete on a combination of factors, primarily differentiated product selection, quality, convenience, customer engagement, store format, location, price and delivery options. Our failure to offer products or services that appeal to our customers\u2019 preferences could lead to a decrease in our sales. To the extent that our competitors offer lower prices or similar products, our ability to maintain profit margins and sales levels may be negatively impacted. In addition, some competitors are aggressively expanding their number of stores or their product offerings, increasing the space allocated to perishable, prepared and specialty foods, including fresh, natural and organic foods, and enhancing options of engaging with and delivering their products to customers. Some of these competitors may have been in business longer or may have greater financial or marketing resources than we do and may be able to devote greater resources to sourcing, promoting and selling\ntheir products. As competition in certain areas or platforms intensifies or competitors open stores or expand delivery options within close proximity to our stores, our results of operations and cash flows may be negatively impacted through a loss of sales, decrease in customer traffic and market share, reduction in margin from competitive price changes or greater operating costs.\nWe rely heavily on sales of fresh produce and quality natural and organic products, and product supply disruptions may have an adverse effect on our profitability and operating results.\nWe have a significant focus on perishable products, including fresh produce and natural and organic products. Sales of produce accounted for approximately 21% and 22% of our net sales in fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. Despite temporary challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have generally not experienced significant difficulty to date in maintaining the supply of our produce and fresh, natural and organic products that meet our quality standards. However, there is no assurance that these products will be available to meet our needs in the future. The availability of such products at competitive prices depends on many factors beyond our control, including the number and size of farms that grow natural or organic crops or raise livestock that meet our quality, welfare and production standards, tariffs and import regulations or restrictions on foreign-sourced products and the ability of our vendors to maintain organic, non-genetically modified or other applicable third-party certifications for such products. Produce is also vulnerable to adverse weather conditions and natural disasters, such as floods, droughts, storms, frosts, wildfires, earthquakes, hurricanes, pestilences and other extreme or abnormal environmental conditions (including the potential effects of climate change), any of which can lower crop yields and reduce crop size and quality. This could reduce the available supply of, or increase the price of, fresh produce, which may adversely impact sales of our fresh produce and our other products that rely on produce as a key ingredient.\nIn addition, we and our suppliers compete with other food retailers in the procurement of fresh, natural and organic products, which are often less available than conventional products. If our competitors significantly increase their fresh, natural and organic product offerings due to increases in consumer demand or otherwise, we and our suppliers may not be able to obtain a sufficient supply of such products on favorable terms, or at all, and our sales may decrease, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We could also suffer significant inventory losses in the event of disruption of our supply chain network or extended power outages in our stores or distribution centers. If we are unable to maintain inventory levels suitable for our business needs, it would materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe current geographic concentration of our stores creates an exposure to local or regional downturns or catastrophic occurrences.\nAs of January 2, 2022, we operated 128 stores in California, making California our largest market representing 34% of our total stores in fiscal 2021. We also have store concentration in Texas, Arizona and Colorado, operating 47, 43 and 32 stores in those states, respectively, and representing 13%, 11% and 9% of our total stores in fiscal 2021, respectively. As we execute our long-term growth strategy, we may become even more concentrated in these markets. In addition, we source a large portion of our produce from California, ranging from approximately 40% to approximately 70% depending on the time of year. As a result, our business is currently more susceptible to regional conditions than the operations of more geographically diversified competitors, and we are vulnerable to economic downturns in those regions. Any unforeseen events or circumstances that negatively affect these areas in which we have stores or from which we obtain products could materially adversely affect our revenues and profitability. These factors include, among other things, changes in demographics, population and employee bases; regulation; wage increases; changes in economic conditions; floods, prolonged droughts, windstorms such as tornados, cyclones, hurricanes and tropical storms, winter storms or other severe weather conditions (whether or not caused by climate change); and other catastrophic occurrences, such as pandemics, earthquakes or wildfires. Such conditions may result in reduced customer traffic and spending in our stores, physical damage to our stores, full or partial loss of power in our stores, loss of inventory, closure of one or more of our stores, inadequate work force in our markets, temporary disruption in the supply of products whether from self or third-party distribution, delays in the delivery of\ngoods to our stores and a reduction in the availability of products in our stores. Any of these factors may disrupt our business and materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFluctuations in commodity prices and availability may impact profitability.\nMany products we sell include ingredients such as wheat, corn, oils, milk, sugar, cocoa, nuts and other key commodities. Many commodity prices are subject to significant fluctuations and may be impacted by tariffs and inflation. Any increase in prices of such key ingredients may cause our vendors to seek price increases from us, and price decreases may result in our competitors reducing retail prices on items containing such ingredients. If we are unable to mitigate these fluctuations, our profitability may be impacted either through increased costs to us or lower prices and loss of customers due to competitive conditions, which may impact gross margins, or through reduced revenue as a result of a decline in the number and average size of customer transactions.\nA widespread health epidemic or other incidents beyond our control could materially impact our business.\nAs evidenced by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, our business could be severely impacted by other widespread regional, national or global health epidemics or other incidents beyond our control such as terrorism, riots, acts of violence and other crimes. Such events may cause customers to avoid public gathering places such as our stores or otherwise change their shopping behaviors. Additionally, these occurrences could adversely impact our business by disrupting production and delivery of products to our stores and by impacting our ability to appropriately staff our stores.\nWe may require additional capital to fund the expansion of our business, and our inability to obtain such capital could harm our business.\nTo support our growth strategy, we must have sufficient capital to continue to make significant investments in our new and existing stores and advertising. If cash flows from operations are not sufficient, we may need additional equity or debt financing to provide the funds required to expand our business. If such financing is not available on satisfactory terms or at all, we may be unable to expand our business or to develop new business at the rate desired. Debt financing increases expenses, may contain covenants that restrict the operation of our business, and must be repaid regardless of operating results. Equity financing, or debt financing that is convertible into equity, could result in additional dilution to our existing stockholders. Our inability to obtain adequate capital resources, whether in the form of equity or debt, to fund our business and growth strategy may require us to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all of our operations or the expansion of our business, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition or prospects.\nIncreasing energy costs, unless offset by more efficient usage or other operational responses, may impact our profitability.\nWe utilize natural gas, water, sewer and electricity in our stores and our transportation providers use gasoline and diesel in trucks that deliver products to our stores. We may also be required to pay certain adjustments or other amounts pursuant to our supply and delivery contracts in connection with increases in fuel prices. Increases in energy costs, whether driven by increased demand, decreased or disrupted supply, increased environmental regulations or an anticipation of any such events or otherwise, will increase the costs of operating our stores and distribution centers. Our shipping costs also may increase if fuel and freight prices increase. We may not be able to recover these rising costs through increased prices charged to our customers, and any increased prices may exacerbate the risk of customers choosing lower-cost alternatives. In addition, if we are unsuccessful in attempts to protect against these increases in energy costs through long-term energy contracts, improved energy procurement, improved efficiency and other operational improvements, the overall costs of operating our stores will increase, which would impact our profitability, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nBusiness and Operating Risks\nOur continued growth largely depends on new store openings, and our failure to successfully open new stores could negatively impact our business.\nOur continued growth depends, in large part, on our ability to open new stores and to operate those stores successfully. Successful implementation of our long-term growth strategy depends upon a number of factors, including our ability to effectively achieve a level of cash flow or obtain necessary financing to support our expansion; find suitable sites for new store locations; negotiate and execute leases on acceptable terms; secure and manage the inventory necessary for the launch and operation of our new stores; hire, train and retain skilled team members; promote and market new stores; successfully execute and gain customer acceptance of our new store format; and address competitive merchandising, distribution, operational and other challenges encountered in connection with expansion into new geographic areas and markets. Although we plan to expand our store base primarily through new store openings, we may grow through strategic acquisitions. Our ability to grow through strategic acquisitions will depend upon our ability to identify suitable targets and negotiate acceptable terms and conditions for their acquisition, as well as our ability to obtain financing for such acquisitions, integrate the acquired stores into our existing store base and retain the customers of such stores. If we are ineffective in performing these activities, then our efforts to open and operate new stores may be unsuccessful or unprofitable, and we may be unable to execute our growth strategy.\nWe opened 12 and 22 stores in fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively, and we currently expect to open approximately 15 to 20 new stores in 2022. Beyond 2022, we expect to achieve 10% annual unit growth, including penetration of new markets with a greater concentration of new stores. However, we may not achieve this expected level of new store growth due to supply chain disruptions or otherwise. We may not have the level of cash flow or financing necessary to support our growth strategy. Additionally, our proposed expansion will place increased demands on our operational, managerial and administrative resources. These increased demands could cause us to operate our existing business less effectively, which in turn could cause deterioration in the financial performance of our existing stores. Further, new store openings in markets where we have existing stores may result in reduced sales volumes at our existing stores in those markets. If we experience a decline in performance, we may slow or discontinue store openings, or we may decide to close stores that we are unable to operate in a profitable manner. If we fail to successfully implement our growth strategy, including by opening new stores, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nWe may be unable to maintain or increase comparable store sales, which could negatively impact our business and stock price.\nWe may not be able to achieve or improve the levels of comparable store sales that we have experienced in the past. Our comparable store sales growth could be lower than our historical average for many reasons, including general economic conditions, competition, cycling prior year performance and the other matters discussed in these Risk Factors. These factors may cause our comparable store sales results to be materially lower than in recent periods, which could harm our business and result in a decline in the price of our common stock.\nDisruption of significant supplier relationships could negatively affect our business.\nKeHE is our primary supplier of dry grocery and frozen food products, accounting for approximately 44% and 42% of our total purchases in fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our current primary contractual relationship with KeHE continues through July 18, 2025 and provides that KeHE will be our primary supplier for all of our stores. Our primary supplier of meat and seafood products accounted for approximately 13% of our total purchases in both fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. Due to this concentration of purchases from a small number of third-party suppliers, the cancellation of our distribution arrangements or the disruption, delay or inability of our suppliers to deliver product to our stores in quantities or within service parameters that meet our requirements may materially and adversely affect our operating results while we establish alternative supply chain channels. Another 3% of our total purchases in both fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively, were made through our secondary supplier of dry grocery and frozen food products, UNFI. Our current contractual relationship with UNFI continues through September 30, 2022. There is no assurance UNFI or other distributors will be able to fulfill our needs on favorable terms or at all. In addition, if KeHE, UNFI or any of our other suppliers fail to comply with food safety, labeling or other laws and regulations, or face allegations of non-compliance, their operations may be disrupted. Further, the food distribution and manufacturing industries are dynamic. Consolidation of distributors or the manufacturers that supply them could reduce our supply options and detrimentally impact the terms under which we purchase products. We may not be able to find replacement suppliers\non commercially reasonable terms, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAny significant interruption in the operations of our distribution centers or supply chain network could disrupt our ability to deliver our produce and other products in a timely manner.\nWe self-distribute our produce through seven distribution centers located in Arizona, Texas, northern California, southern California, Georgia, Colorado and Florida. As we further expand our geographic footprint, we may require additional distribution centers. Any unanticipated or unusual expenses or significant interruption or failure in the operation of our distribution center infrastructure, such as disruptions due to fire, severe weather or other catastrophic events, power outages, labor shortages or disagreements, shipping or infrastructure problems, food safety concerns, integration of new distribution centers into our supply chain network, inability of our new distribution centers to perform as expected or contractual disputes with third-party service providers could result in increased expenses and adversely impact our ability to distribute produce and other products to our stores. Such interruptions could result in lost sales and a loss of customer loyalty to our brand, as well as increased costs from third-party service providers. While we maintain business interruption and property insurance, if the operation of our distribution centers or transportation network were interrupted for any reason, causing delays in shipment of product to our stores, our insurance may not be sufficient to cover losses we experience, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, unexpected delays in deliveries from vendors that ship directly to our stores or increases in distribution and transportation costs (including through increased fuel costs) could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Labor shortages, work stoppages or wage increases in the transportation or other industries, long-term disruptions to the national and international transportation infrastructure, reduction in capacity and industry-specific regulations such as hours-of-service rules that lead to delays or interruptions of deliveries or increased costs could negatively affect our business.\nDisruptions to, security breaches or non-compliance involving, our information technology systems could harm our ability to run our business and expose us to potential liability and loss of revenues.\nWe rely extensively on information technology systems for point-of-sale processing in our stores, supply chain, financial reporting, human resources, store operations and various other processes and transactions. Our information technology systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches, including tampering with hardware and breaches of our transaction processing or other systems that could result in the compromise of confidential customer or team member data, ransomware attacks, catastrophic events, and usage errors by our team members. Phishing attacks have emerged as particularly pervasive, including as a means for ransomware attacks, which have increased both in frequency and breadth. In response, we have implemented numerous security protocols in order to strengthen security, and we maintain a customary cyber insurance policy, but there can be no assurance breaches will not occur in the future, be detected in a timely manner or be covered by our insurance policy. Significant expenditures could be required to remedy future cybersecurity problems and protect against future breaches. Additionally, compliance with current and future applicable U.S. privacy, cybersecurity and related laws, including for example the California Privacy Act of 2018 (\u201cCCPA\u201d) and the California Privacy Rights Act (\u201cCPRA\u201d), can be costly and time-consuming. These costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, and our efforts may not meaningfully limit the success of future attempts to breach our information technology systems.\nOur information technology systems may also fail to perform as we anticipate, and we may encounter difficulties or significant expenses in implementing new systems, adapting these systems to changing technologies or legal requirements or expanding them to meet the future needs and growth of our business. If our systems are improperly implemented, breached, damaged, cease to function properly, or are perceived to have failed, we may have to make significant investments to fix or replace them; suffer interruptions in our operations; experience data loss; incur liability to our customers, team members and others; face costly litigation, enforcement actions and penalties; and our brand and\nreputation with our customers may be harmed. Various third parties, such as our suppliers and payment processors, also rely heavily on information technology systems, and any failure of these systems could also cause loss of sales, transactional or other data and significant interruptions to our business. Any security breach or other material interruption in the information technology systems we rely on may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nReal or perceived concerns that products we sell could cause unexpected side effects, illness, injury or death could result in their discontinuance or expose us to lawsuits, either of which could result in unexpected costs and damage to our reputation.\nThere is increasing governmental scrutiny of and public awareness regarding food safety. Unexpected side effects, illness, injury, or death caused by products we prepare and/or sell or involving vendors that provide us with products or services could result in the discontinuance of sales of these products or our relationship with such vendors or prevent us from achieving market acceptance of the affected products. Such side effects, illnesses, injuries and death could also expose us to severe damage to our reputation, product liability or negligence lawsuits or government enforcement actions. Any claims brought against us may exceed our existing or future insurance policy coverage or limits. Any judgment against us that is in excess of our policy limits would have to be paid from our cash reserves, which would reduce our capital resources. Further, we may not have sufficient capital resources to pay a judgment, in which case our creditors could levy against our assets.\nAs a fresh, natural and organic retailer, we believe that many customers choose to shop our stores because of their interest in health, nutrition and food safety. As a result, we believe that our customers hold us to a high food safety standard. Therefore, real or perceived quality or food safety concerns, whether or not ultimately based on fact, and whether or not involving products prepared and/or sold at our stores or vendors that supply us with products or provide us with services, would cause negative publicity and lost confidence regarding our company, brand, or products, which could in turn harm our reputation and net sales, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nIf we are unable to successfully identify market trends and react to changing consumer preferences in a timely manner, our sales may decrease.\nWe believe our success depends, in substantial part, on our ability to:\n\u2022anticipate, identify and react to fresh, natural and organic grocery and dietary supplement trends and changing consumer preferences and demographics in a timely manner;\n\u2022translate market trends into appropriate, innovative, saleable product and service offerings in our stores before our competitors; and\n\u2022develop and maintain vendor and service provider relationships that provide us access to the newest on-trend merchandise and customer engagement options on reasonable terms.\nConsumer preferences often change rapidly and without warning, moving from one trend to another among many product or retail concepts. Our performance is impacted by trends regarding healthy lifestyles, product attributes, dietary preferences, convenient options, natural and organic products, meal solutions, ingredient transparency and sustainability, and vitamins and supplements, as well as new and evolving methods of engaging with and delivering our products to our customers. Consumer preferences towards vitamins, supplements or natural and organic food products might shift as a result of, among other things, economic conditions, food safety perceptions, scientific research or findings regarding the benefits or efficacy of such products, national media attention and the cost or sustainability of these products. Our store offerings currently include natural and organic products and dietary supplements. A change in consumer preferences away from our offerings would have a material adverse effect on our business. Additionally, negative publicity over the safety, efficacy or benefits of any such items may adversely affect demand for our products, and could result in lower customer traffic, sales, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we are unable to anticipate and satisfy consumer preferences with respect to product offerings and customer engagement options, our sales may decrease, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur newly opened stores may negatively impact our financial results in the short-term, and may not achieve sales and operating levels consistent with our more mature stores on a timely basis or at all.\nWe have actively pursued new store growth and plan to continue doing so in the future. Our new store openings may not be as successful or reach the sales and profitability levels of our existing stores. New store openings may negatively impact our financial results in the short-term due to the effect of store opening costs and lower sales and contribution to overall profitability during the initial period following opening. New stores build their sales volume and their customer base over time and, as a result, generally have lower margins and higher operating expenses, as a percentage of net sales, than our more mature stores. New stores may not achieve sustained sales and operating levels consistent with our more mature store base on a timely basis or at all. This may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. Further, we have experienced in the past, and expect to experience in the future, some sales volume transfer from our existing stores to our new stores as some of our existing customers switch to new, closer locations. If our new stores are less profitable than our existing stores, or if we experience sales volume transfer from our existing stores, our financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected.\nOn many of our projects, we have received landlord contributions for leasehold improvements and other build-out costs. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to continue to receive landlord contributions at the same levels or at all. Any reductions of landlord contributions could have an adverse impact on our new store cash-on-cash returns and our operating results.\nWe may be unable to maintain or improve our operating margins, which could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to grow.\nIf we are unable to successfully manage the potential difficulties associated with store growth, we may not be able to capture the efficiencies of scale that we expect from expansion. If we are not able to capture efficiencies of scale, improve our systems, sustain cost discipline, optimize promotional activity and maintain appropriate store labor levels and disciplined product selection, our customer traffic and operating margins may stagnate or decline. In addition, competition and pricing pressures from competitors may also adversely impact our operating margins. Both our inability to capture the efficiencies from scale and competition could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nIf we fail to maintain our reputation and the value of our brand, our sales may decline.\nWe believe our continued success depends on our ability to maintain and grow the value of the Sprouts brand. Maintaining, promoting and positioning our brand and reputation will depend largely on the success of our marketing and merchandising efforts and our ability to provide a consistent, high-quality customer experience. Brand value is based in large part on perceptions of subjective qualities, and even isolated incidents involving our company, our team members, suppliers, agents or third-party service providers, or the products we sell can erode trust and confidence, particularly if they involve our private label products, or result in adverse publicity, governmental investigations or litigation. Our brand could be adversely affected if we fail to achieve these objectives, or if our public image or reputation were to be tarnished by negative publicity.\nThe loss of key management could negatively affect our business.\nWe are dependent upon a number of key management and other team members. If we were to lose the services of a key member of our management team or a significant number of key team members within a short period of time, this could have a material adverse effect on our operations as we may not be able to find suitable individuals to replace them on a timely basis, if at all. In addition, any such departure could be viewed in a negative light by investors and analysts, which may cause our stock price to decline. We do not maintain key person insurance on any team member.\nIf we are unable to attract, train and retain team members, we may not be able to grow or successfully operate our business.\nThe food retail industry is labor intensive. Our continued success is dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified team members in our stores and at our regional and store support offices who\nunderstand and appreciate our culture and are able to represent our brand effectively and establish credibility with our business partners and consumers. We face intense competition for qualified team members, many of whom are subject to offers from competing employers. Due to concerns around COVID-19 and other factors, we have experienced, and could continue to experience, a shortage of labor for store positions. Such labor shortages could be further exacerbated by expanded COVID-19 vaccination or testing requirements. Our ability to meet our labor needs, while controlling wage and labor-related costs, is subject to numerous external factors, including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force in the markets in which we are located, unemployment levels within those markets, unionization of the available work force, prevailing wage rates, changing demographics, health and other insurance costs and changes in employment legislation. In the event of increasing wage rates, if we fail to increase our wages competitively, the quality of our workforce could decline, causing our customer engagement to suffer, while increasing our wages could cause our earnings to decrease. If we are unable to hire and retain team members capable of meeting our business needs and expectations, our business and brand image may be impaired. Any failure to meet our staffing needs or any material increase in turnover rates of our team members or team member wages may adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nUnion attempts to organize our team members could negatively affect our business.\nNone of our team members are currently subject to a collective bargaining agreement. As we continue to grow and enter different regions, unions may attempt to organize all or part of our team member base at certain stores or within certain regions. Responding to such organization attempts may distract management and team members and may have a negative financial impact on individual stores, or on our business as a whole.\nHigher wage and benefit costs could adversely affect our business.\nChanges in federal and state minimum wage laws and other laws relating to employee compensation and benefits could cause us to incur additional wage and benefit costs, as well as increased contractual costs associated with our service providers. Increased labor costs brought about by changes in minimum wage laws, other regulations or prevailing market conditions would increase our expenses and have an adverse impact on our profitability.\nOur lease obligations could adversely affect our financial performance and may require us to continue paying rent for store locations that we no longer operate.\nWe are subject to risks associated with our current and future store, distribution center and administrative office real estate leases. Our high level of fixed lease obligations will require us to use a portion of cash generated by our operations to satisfy these obligations, and could adversely impact our ability to obtain future financing, if required, to support our growth or other operational investments. We will require substantial cash flows from operations to make our payments under our operating leases, all of which provide for periodic increases in rent. If we are not able to make the required payments under the leases, the lenders or owners of the relevant stores, distribution centers or administrative offices may, among other things, repossess those assets, which could adversely affect our ability to conduct our operations. In addition, our failure to make payments under our operating leases could trigger defaults under other leases or under agreements governing our indebtedness, which could cause the counterparties under those agreements to accelerate the obligations due thereunder.\nFurther, we generally cannot cancel our leases, so if we decide to close or relocate a location, we may nonetheless be committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease, including paying the base rent for the remaining lease term. In addition, as our leases expire, we may fail to negotiate renewals, either on commercially acceptable terms or any terms at all, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nClaims under our insurance plans may differ from our estimates, which could materially impact our results of operations.\nWe use a combination of insurance and self-insurance plans to provide for potential liabilities, including for workers\u2019 compensation, general liability (including, in connection with legal proceedings described under \u201c-Legal proceedings could materially impact our business, financial condition, results of\noperations and cash flows\u201d below), property insurance, director and officers\u2019 liability insurance, vehicle liability and team member health-care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by us are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. Our results could be materially impacted by claims and other expenses related to such plans if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends.\nWe may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations, which could adversely impact our business.\nAs of January 2, 2022, we had outstanding indebtedness of $250.0 million under our credit agreement (referred to as the \u201cAmended and Restated Credit Agreement\u201d). We may incur additional indebtedness in the future, including borrowings under our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Our indebtedness, any additional indebtedness we may incur, or any hedging arrangements related to such indebtedness could require us to divert funds identified for other purposes for debt service and impair our liquidity position. If we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt, we may need to refinance our debt, dispose of assets or issue equity to obtain necessary funds. We do not know whether we will be able to take any of such actions on a timely basis, on terms satisfactory to us or at all.\nCovenants in our debt agreements restrict our operational flexibility.\nOur Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains usual and customary restrictive covenants relating to our management and the operation of our business, including incurring additional indebtedness; making certain investments; merging, dissolving, liquidating, consolidating, or disposing of all or substantially all of our assets; paying dividends, making distributions, or redeeming capital stock; entering into transactions with our affiliates; and granting liens on our assets.\nOur Amended and Restated Credit Agreement also requires us to maintain a specified total net leverage ratio and minimum interest coverage ratio at the end of any fiscal quarter at any time the facility is drawn. Our ability to meet these ratios, if applicable, could be affected by events beyond our control. Failure to comply with any of the covenants under our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement could result in a default under the facility, which could cause our lenders to accelerate the timing of payments and exercise their lien on substantially all of our assets, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nFinancial Reporting, Legal and Other Regulatory Risks\nWe, as well as our vendors, are subject to numerous laws and regulations and our compliance with these laws and regulations may increase our costs, limit or eliminate our ability to sell certain products, raise regulatory enforcement risks, or otherwise adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nEnforcement. Both FDA and USDA have broad authority to enforce their applicable provisions relating to the safety, labeling, manufacturing, distribution and promotion of foods, cosmetics, homeopathic and dietary supplements, including powers to issue a public warning letter to a company, publicize information about adulterated or misbranded products, institute an administrative detention of products, request or order a recall of food from the market, and request the Department of Justice to initiate a seizure action, an injunction action or a criminal prosecution.\nDietary Supplement, CBD and Homeopathic Product Risks. Our sales of dietary supplements are regulated by FDA. However, other public and private actors are increasingly targeting dietary supplement retailers and manufacturers for selling products that fail to adhere to requirements under FDCA, as amended by DSHEA. While FDCA provides FDA with the authority to remove products from the market that are adulterated or misbranded, state actors, and the Plaintiffs\u2019 Bar have been targeting retailers and manufacturers of dietary supplements for failing to adhere to current good manufacturing practices and for false or misleading product statements. As a retailer of certain topical or ingestible cannabidiol (\u201cCBD\u201d) products, the FDA also has the authority to remove from the market any CBD product if it is adulterated, its labeling is false or misleading, it is otherwise misbranded, or if it violates any other FDCA or FDA requirement or regulation. This enforcement authority extends to states that have legalized and regulated the distribution of CBD products. The FDCA also provides FDA with the authority to remove homeopathic products from the market that are adulterated or misbranded or contain improper or excessive amounts of\nactive ingredients. Further marketing homeopathic products with quality issues have also been targets for litigation.\nAdvertising and Product Claims Risks. In connection with the marketing and advertisement of products we sell, we could be the target of claims relating to false or deceptive advertising, including under the oversight of the FTC and pursuant to the consumer protection statutes of some states. Furthermore, in recent years, the FDA has been aggressive in enforcing its regulations with respect to nutrient content claims (e.g., \u201clow fat,\u201d \u201cgood source of,\u201d \u201ccalorie free,\u201d etc.), unauthorized \u201chealth claims\u201d (claims that characterize the relationship between a food or food ingredient and a disease or health condition), and other claims that impermissibly suggest therapeutic benefits for certain foods or food components. These events could interrupt the marketing and sales of products in our stores, including our private label products, severely damage our brand reputation and public image, increase the cost of products in our stores, result in product recalls or costly litigation, and impede our ability to deliver merchandise in sufficient quantities or quality to our stores, which could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur reputation could also suffer from real or perceived issues involving the labeling or marketing of products we sell as \u201cnatural.\u201d Although the FDA and the USDA have each issued statements regarding the appropriate use of the word \u201cnatural,\u201d there is no single, U.S. government-regulated definition of the term \u201cnatural\u201d for use in the food industry. The resulting uncertainty has led to consumer confusion, distrust and legal challenges. Plaintiffs have commenced legal actions against a number of food companies and retailers that market \u201cnatural\u201d or similarly labeled products, asserting false, misleading and deceptive advertising and labeling claims, including claims related to genetically modified ingredients. Should we become subject to similar claims, consumers may avoid purchasing products from us or seek alternatives, even if the basis for the claim is unfounded. Adverse publicity about these matters may discourage consumers from buying our products. The cost of defending against any such claims could be significant. Any loss of confidence on the part of consumers in the truthfulness of our labeling or ingredient claims would be difficult and costly to overcome and may significantly reduce our brand value. Any of these events could adversely affect our reputation and brand and decrease our sales, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOrganic and GMO Claims. We are also subject to the USDA\u2019s Organic Rule, which facilitates interstate commerce and the marketing of organically produced food, and provides assurance to our customers that such products meet consistent, uniform standards. Compliance with the USDA\u2019s Organic Rule also places a significant burden on some of our suppliers, which may cause a disruption in some of our product offerings. Additionally, the USDA has promulgated regulations that require disclosure of whether food offered for sale contains bioengineered (GMO) ingredients. Implementation began in January 2022.\nFSMA Implementation Costs. FSMA directed an historic shift at FDA from the agency reacting to and solving problems in the food supply chain to preventing contamination of food before it occurs. FSMA accomplished this goal by overhauling FDA\u2019s current food safety program to require all actors in the food supply chain to expand their safety programs and record keeping processes. FSMA\u2019s continued implementation and FDA\u2019s own development in understanding effective ways to enforce FSMA provisions could delay the supply of certain products or result in certain products being unavailable to us for sale.\nEcommerce Platform and Third-Party Risks. Our online order ecommerce platform is subject to the same laws and regulations as our retail operations. Product statements made on our website must be in accordance with labeling requirements. As is common in our industry, we rely on our suppliers and contract manufacturers to ensure that the products they manufacture and sell to us comply with all applicable regulatory and legal requirements. In general, we seek representations and warranties, indemnification and/or insurance from our suppliers and contract manufacturers. However, even with adequate insurance and indemnification, any claims of non-compliance could significantly damage our reputation and consumer confidence in products we sell. In addition, the failure of such products to comply with applicable regulatory and legislative requirements could prevent us from marketing the products or require us to recall or remove such products from our stores. In order to comply with applicable statutes and regulations, our suppliers and contract manufacturers have from time to time\nreformulated, eliminated or relabeled certain of their products and we have revised certain provisions of our sales and marketing program.\nWe are also subject to laws and regulations more generally applicable to retailers. Compliance with or changes to such laws and regulations may increase our costs, limit or eliminate our ability to sell certain products or otherwise adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations more generally applicable to retailers, including labor and employment, taxation, zoning and land use, environmental protection, workplace safety, public health, community right-to-know, data privacy, consumer protection and alcoholic beverage sales. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we are subject to additional governmental regulations and health guidelines, as well as other voluntary safety protocols. Our stores are subject to unscheduled inspections on a regular basis, which, if violations are found, could result in the assessment of fines, suspension of one or more needed licenses and, in the case of repeated \u201ccritical\u201d violations, closure of the store until a re-inspection demonstrates that we have remediated the problem. Further, our new store openings could be delayed or prevented, or our existing stores could be impacted by difficulties or failures in our ability to obtain or maintain required permits, approvals or licenses. In addition, we are subject to environmental laws pursuant to which we could be held responsible for all of the costs or liabilities relating to any contamination at our or our predecessors\u2019 past or present facilities and at third-party waste disposal sites, regardless of our knowledge of, or responsibility for, such contamination, and such costs may exceed our environmental liability insurance coverage.\nAs is common in our industry, we rely on our suppliers and contract manufacturers to ensure that the products they manufacture and sell to us comply with all applicable regulatory and legislative requirements. In general, we seek representations and warranties, indemnification and/or insurance from our suppliers and contract manufacturers. However, even with adequate insurance and indemnification, any claims of non-compliance could significantly damage our reputation and consumer confidence in our products. In order to comply with applicable statutes and regulations, our suppliers and contract manufacturers have from time to time reformulated, eliminated or relabeled certain of their products and we have revised certain provisions of our sales and marketing program.\nWe cannot predict the nature of future laws, regulations, interpretations or applications, or determine what effect either additional government regulations or executive or administrative orders, when and if promulgated, or disparate federal, state and local regulatory schemes would have on our business in the future. They could, however, increase our costs; result in our unintended misinterpretation or noncompliance; expose us to litigation; require the reformulation of certain products or alternative sourcing from domestic suppliers or otherwise to meet new standards, regulations or trade restrictions; require the recall or discontinuance of certain products not able to be reformulated or alternatively sourced in compliance with new regulations or restrictions; impose additional recordkeeping; expand documentation of the properties of certain products; necessitate expanded or different labeling and/or scientific substantiation; or require us to discontinue certain operations. Any or all of such requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nLegal proceedings could materially impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur operations, which are characterized by a high volume of customer traffic and data collection and by transactions involving a wide variety of product selections, carry a higher exposure to consumer litigation risk when compared to the operations of companies operating in some other industries. Consequently, we may be a party to individual personal injury, product liability, intellectual property, data security and privacy, accessibility and other legal actions in the ordinary course of our business, including litigation arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, food-related illness or product labeling. In addition, our team members may, from time to time, bring lawsuits against us regarding injury, hostile work environment, discrimination, wage and hour disputes, sexual harassment, or other employment issues. In recent years, there has been an increase in the number of discrimination and harassment claims across the United States generally. The outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits, is difficult to assess or quantify. Plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. While we maintain insurance, insurance coverage may not be adequate, and the cost to defend against future litigation may be significant. There may also be adverse publicity\nassociated with litigation that may decrease consumer confidence in or perceptions of our business, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable. As a result, litigation may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, which could harm our business.\nWe rely on a combination of trademark, trade secret, copyright and domain name law and internal procedures and nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property. In particular, we believe our trademarks, including SPROUTS FARMERS MARKET\u00ae and SPROUTS\u00ae, and our domain names, including sprouts.com, are valuable assets. However, there can be no assurance that our intellectual property rights will be sufficient to distinguish our products and services from those of our competitors and to provide us with a competitive advantage. From time to time, third parties may use names and logos similar to ours, may apply to register trademarks or domain names similar to ours, and may infringe or otherwise violate our intellectual property rights. There can be no assurance that our intellectual property rights can be successfully asserted against such third parties or will not be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. Asserting or defending our intellectual property rights could be time consuming and costly and could distract management\u2019s attention and resources. If we are unable to prevent our competitors from using names, logos and domain names similar to ours, consumer confusion could result, the perception of our brand and products could be negatively affected, and our sales and profitability could suffer as a result. We also license the SPROUTS FARMERS MARKETS trademark to a third party for use in operating two grocery stores. If the licensee fails to maintain the quality of the goods and services used in connection with this trademark, our rights to, and the value of, this and similar trademarks could potentially be harmed. Negative publicity relating to the licensee could also be incorrectly associated with us, which could harm the business. Failure to protect our proprietary information could also have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may also be subject to claims that our intellectual property, activities or the products we sell infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of others. Any such claims can be time consuming and costly to defend and may distract management\u2019s attention and resources, even if the claims are without merit. Such claims may also require us to enter into costly settlement or license agreements (which could, for example, prevent us from using our trademarks in certain geographies or in connection with certain products and services), pay costly damage awards, and face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from marketing or providing the affected products and services, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nChanges in accounting standards may materially impact reporting of our financial condition and results of operations.\nAccounting principles generally accepted in the United States and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines, and interpretations for many aspects of our business, such as accounting for leases, inventories, goodwill and intangible assets, store closures, insurance, income taxes, share-based compensation and accounting for mergers and acquisitions and other special items, are complex and involve subjective judgments. Changes in these rules or their interpretation may necessitate changes to our financial statement presentation and significantly change or add significant volatility to our reported earnings without a comparable underlying change in cash flow from operations. As a result, changes in accounting standards may materially impact our reported financial condition and results of operations. For example, our adoption of ASC 842, Leases, effective in fiscal 2019 impacted our financial statement presentation and financial results.\nIf we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future, we may fail to prevent or detect material misstatements in our financial statements, in which case investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock may decline.\nAs a public company, we are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting. If we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, if we identify any material\nweaknesses therein, if we are unsuccessful in our efforts to remediate any such material weakness, if our management is unable to report that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock could be negatively affected. In addition, we could become subject to investigations by the NASDAQ Stock Market, the SEC, or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources.\nIf our goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.\nWe have a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets. As of January 2, 2022, we had goodwill and intangible assets of approximately $368.9 million and $185.0 million, respectively, which represented approximately 13% and 6% of our total assets as of such date, respectively. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth fiscal quarter or whenever events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting unit below its carrying amount. Fair value is determined based on the discounted cash flows and the market value of our single reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an immediate charge to earnings would be recorded for the amount by which the reporting unit's carrying amount exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of the goodwill, which would adversely affect our operating results.\nOur nutrition-oriented educational activities may be impacted by government regulation or our inability to secure adequate liability insurance.\nWe provide nutrition-oriented information to our customers, and these activities may be subject to state and federal regulation and oversight by professional organizations or misconstrued by our customers as medical advice. In the past, the FDA has expressed concerns regarding summarized health and nutrition-related information that (i) does not, in the FDA\u2019s view, accurately present such information, (ii) diverts a consumer\u2019s attention and focus from FDA-required nutrition labeling and information or (iii) impermissibly promotes drug-type disease-related benefits. If our team members or third parties we engage to provide this information do not act in accordance with regulatory requirements, we may become subject to penalties or litigation that could have a material adverse effect on our business. We believe we are currently in compliance with relevant regulatory requirements. However, we cannot predict the nature of future government regulation and oversight, including the potential impact of any such regulation on this activity. Furthermore, the availability of professional liability insurance or the scope of such coverage may change, or our insurance coverage may prove inadequate, which may adversely impact the ability of our customer educators to provide some information to our customers. The occurrence of any such developments could negatively impact the perception of our brand, our sales and our ability to attract new customers.\nCommon Stock Ownership Risks\nOur stock price may be volatile, and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you paid for them or at all.\nThere is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which our stockholders have purchased their shares. The trading price of our common stock may be volatile and subject to wide price fluctuations in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control. Furthermore, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These and other factors may cause the market price and demand for our common stock to fluctuate substantially, which may limit or prevent investors from readily selling their shares of common stock and may otherwise negatively affect the price or liquidity of our common stock. In addition, in the past, when the market price of a stock has been volatile, holders of that stock have sometimes instituted securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock. If any of our stockholders were to bring a lawsuit against us, we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit or paying for settlements or damages. Such a lawsuit could also divert the time and attention of our management.\nAnti-takeover provisions could impair a takeover attempt and adversely affect existing stockholders.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and applicable provisions of Delaware law may have the effect of rendering more difficult, delaying, or preventing an acquisition of our company, even when this would be in the best interest of our stockholders. These include, without limitation, the following provisions:\n\u2022a classified board of directors (referred to as the \u201cBoard\u201d) whose members serve staggered three-year terms;\n\u2022\u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, which could be issued by the board without stockholder approval and may contain voting, liquidation, dividend, and other rights superior to our common stock;\n\u2022inability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders, which may delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or the ability of holders controlling a majority of our capital stock to take action, including the removal of directors; and\n\u2022required advance notice of stockholder proposals for business to be conducted at meetings of our stockholders and for nominations of candidates for election to the board.\nAny provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts cease publishing research or reports about us, our business, or our market, or if they adversely change their recommendations regarding our stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors. If we do not maintain adequate research coverage, or if any of the analysts who may cover us downgrade our stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business or provide relatively more favorable recommendations about our competitors, our stock price could decline. If any analyst who may cover us were to cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nSince we do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the near future, investors may be forced to sell their stock in order to obtain a return on their investment.\nAlthough we regularly evaluate our capital structure and opportunities to create value for our investors, we do not anticipate declaring or paying in the near future any cash dividends on our capital stock. Instead, we plan to retain any earnings to finance our operations and growth plans. In addition, our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains covenants that we must satisfy in order to pay cash dividends. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any return on their investment. As a result, investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock.\nOur business could be impacted as a result of actions by activist stockholders or others.\nWe may be subject, from time to time, to legal and business challenges in the operation of our company due to actions instituted by activist shareholders or others. Responding to such actions, which may include private engagement, publicity campaigns, proxy contests, efforts to force transactions not supported by our Board, and litigation, could be costly and time-consuming, may not align with our strategic plan and could divert the time and attention of our Board and management from our business. Perceived uncertainties as to our future direction as a result of stockholder activism may lead to the perception of a change in the direction of the business or other instability and may affect our stock price, relationships with vendors, customers, prospective and current team members and others.", "PERMNO": 14102, "SIC": 5411, "TIC": "SFM"}
