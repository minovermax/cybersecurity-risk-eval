Risk Factors.\nA description of the risks and uncertainties associated with our business is set forth below. You should carefully consider such risks and uncertainties, together with the other information contained in this report, and in our other public filings. If any of such risks and uncertainties actually occurs, our business, financial condition, or operating results could differ materially from the plans, projections, and other forward-looking statements included in the section titled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and elsewhere in this report and in our other public filings. In addition, if any of the following risks and uncertainties, or if any other risks and uncertainties, actually occurs, our business, financial condition, or operating results could be harmed substantially, which could cause the market price of our stock to decline, perhaps significantly.\nRisk Factors Summary\nOur business is subject to a number of risks that may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

from Support. If we fail to adapt this product to changing market dynamics and customer preferences or to maintain or achieve increased market acceptance of Support, our business, results of operations, financial condition, and growth prospects would be harmed.\nWe derive, and expect to continue to derive, substantially all of our revenue and cash flows from sales of subscriptions to Support or from sales of subscriptions to offerings and solutions primarily resulting from an interest in Support. As such, the market acceptance of this product solution is critical to our success. Demand for our solutions is affected by a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, such as continued market acceptance of our solutions by customers for existing and new use cases, the timing of development and release of new product and platform solutions, features, and functionality introduced by our competitors, and growth or contraction in our addressable market. We expect that an increasing focus on the customer experience and the growth of various communications channels will continue to impact the market for our software and blur distinctions between traditionally separate systems for customer support, customer engagement and retention software, messaging, sales force automation, and other customer relationship management product and platform solutions, enabling new competitors to emerge. If we are unable to meet customer demands to improve relationships between organizations and their customers through flexible solutions designed to address all these needs or otherwise achieve more widespread market acceptance of our solutions, our business, results of operations, financial condition, and growth prospects will be adversely affected. Conversely, if the market for customer experience does not continue to increase relative to prior quarters, demand for our solutions will be negatively impacted.\nIf we are not able to develop enhancements to our product and platform solutions, provide a unified and reliable experience between our solutions, or introduce new solutions and services that achieve market acceptance and that keep pace with technological developments, our business would be harmed.\nOur ability to attract new customers and increase revenue from existing customers depends in large part on our ability to enhance and improve our existing solutions and to introduce new solutions. In order to grow our business, we must research and develop solutions and services that reflect the changing nature of the customer experience, and expand beyond customer service to other areas of improving relationships between organizations and their customers or potential customers. In addition, as we develop and introduce new products and services, including those incorporating or utilizing artificial intelligence and machine learning, they may raise new, or heighten existing, technological, legal and other challenges. In order to retain our business, we must ensure that our existing solutions and services maintain the high level of reliability, security, and sophistication our customers will continue to expect, while ensuring that we provide a unified and seamless experience across our solutions. Those expectations will continue to evolve and the resources required to continue to maintain reliable and secure solutions and services, particularly as we increasingly rely on and sell offerings which incorporate multiple solutions such as the Zendesk Suite, will increase over time.\nWe have limited history in offering multiple product and platform solutions as part of a comprehensive customer experience solution to our customers. As we increase focus on the customer experience and increasingly seek to offer our solutions as part of a broader offering, we may discover challenges in creating a seamless, unified offering across our solutions that achieves market acceptance and grows our business. In the fiscal years ending 2021 and 2020, our research and development expenses were 26% and 25% of our revenue, respectively. If we do not spend our research and development budget efficiently or effectively on compelling innovation and technologies, our operating results may be harmed and we may not realize the expected benefits of our strategy.\nThe success of any enhancement to our solutions depends on several factors, including timely completion, adequate quality testing, service reliability, and market acceptance. Any new solution or service that we develop may not be introduced in a timely or cost-effective manner, may contain defects, introduce new service reliability issues, or may not achieve the market acceptance necessary to generate sufficient revenue. If we are unable to successfully develop new solutions or services, integrate those solutions with our existing solutions, enhance our existing solutions to meet new customer requirements, or otherwise gain market acceptance, our business and operating results will be harmed. In particular, as we continue to manage operational costs, our long-term plans for the development of our products and services may be negatively impacted.\nWe may not be able to integrate new product and platform solutions into our infrastructure, which could negatively impact our future sales and results of operations.\nOur business depends in part on our ability to build or acquire product and platform solutions that both complement our existing solutions and respond to our customers\u2019 needs. Our customers also expect that new solutions will integrate with existing solutions that we currently offer. This expectation has increased especially with the launch of the Zendesk Suite, which packages multiple solutions into one offering. Our ability to successfully integrate newly developed or acquired solutions into a shared services infrastructure is unproven. Because we have a limited history in integrating newly developed or acquired solutions and the market for such solutions is rapidly evolving, it is difficult for us to predict our operating results following the integration of such solutions. If we are not able to fully integrate new solutions into our infrastructure and across multiple solutions, customer usage of our product may be disrupted, new demand for our solutions may be negatively affected if those disruptions are more broadly known, and retention of our current customers may be impacted.\nIf we fail to integrate our product and platform solutions with a variety of operating systems, software applications, and hardware that are developed by others, our solutions may become less marketable, less competitive, or obsolete, and our operating results would be harmed.\nOur solutions must integrate with a variety of e-mail, messaging, software platforms, network, and hardware, and we need to continuously modify and enhance our product and platform solutions to adapt to changes in cloud-enabled hardware, software, networking, messaging, browser, and database technologies. For example, we have developed our solutions to be able to easily integrate with third-party SaaS applications and messaging platforms, including the applications of software providers that compete with us, through the interaction of application platform interfaces, or APIs. To date, we have not typically relied on a long-term written contract to govern our relationship with these providers. Instead, we are typically subject to the standard terms and conditions for application developers of such providers, which govern the distribution, operation, and fees of such software systems, and which are subject to change by such providers from time to time. To the extent that we do not have long-term written contracts to govern our relationship with these providers, we rely on the fact that the providers of such software systems continue to allow us access to their APIs to enable these customer integrations. Our business may be harmed if any provider of such software systems:\n\u2022discontinues or limits our access to its APIs;\n\u2022modifies its terms of service or other policies, including fees charged to, or other restrictions on, us or other application developers;\n\u2022changes how customer information is accessed by us or our customers;\n\u2022establishes more favorable relationships with or acquires one or more of our competitors;\n\u2022is acquired by our competitors, potentially resulting in more limited access to their systems; or\n\u2022otherwise favors its own competitive offerings over ours.\nWe believe a significant component of our value proposition to customers is the ability to optimize and configure our solutions to communicate with these third-party applications through our respective APIs. If we are not permitted or able to integrate with these and other third-party applications in the future, demand for our solutions could be adversely impacted and business and operating results would be harmed. In addition, we have designed mobile applications to provide access to our solutions through these devices. If we cannot provide effective functionality through these mobile applications as required by organizations and individuals that widely use mobile devices, we may experience difficulty attracting and retaining customers. Failure of our solutions to operate effectively with future infrastructure platforms and technologies could also reduce the demand for our solutions, resulting in customer dissatisfaction and harm to our business. If we are unable to respond to changes in a cost-effective manner, our solutions may become less marketable, less competitive, or obsolete, and our operating results may be negatively impacted.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nThe market in which we participate is intensely competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could be harmed.\nPricing pressures and increased competition generally could result in reduced sales, reduced margins, losses, or the failure of our solutions to achieve or maintain more widespread market acceptance, any of which could harm our business. The market for customer experience solutions is fragmented, rapidly evolving, and highly competitive, with relatively low barriers to entry. Our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards, or customer requirements, and we expect competition to continue to intensify in the future. Among the small to midsized organizations that make up a large proportion of our customers, we often compete with general use computer applications and other tools, which these organizations use to provide support and which can be deployed for little or no cost. These include shared accounts for email communication, phone banks for voice communication and text messaging, shared accounts for social messaging, text editors, and spreadsheets for tracking and management. In addition, we compete with a number of other SaaS providers with focused applications or broader suites of product offerings, which may be competitive to one or more of our product and platform solutions that our potential customers may elect to use in lieu of our solutions, such as Freshworks Inc. and HubSpot, Inc. As a result, small to midsized organizations are able to switch to one of our competitors relatively easily. Additionally, as the barriers to entry are low into this market, new entrants or current competitors may be able to change branding, marketing, or sales strategy more quickly and effectively than us, and/or develop products that mimic our new product releases and sell those products at a low price, resulting in a decreased ability for us to increase our marketing pipeline or sales.\nWe face competition from in-house software systems, large integrated systems vendors, and smaller companies offering alternative SaaS applications. Many of our current and potential competitors have established marketing relationships, access to larger customer bases, pre-existing customer relationships, and major distribution agreements with consultants, system integrators, and resellers. Some existing and potential customers, particularly large organizations, have elected, and may in the future elect, to develop their own internal customer support software systems. Certain of our competitors have partnered with, or have acquired, and may in the future partner with or acquire, other competitors to offer services, leveraging their collective competitive positions, which makes it more difficult for us to compete with them. In particular, as multiproduct and platform offerings increase in prevalence, our competitors who focus on such offerings may, through organic growth or acquisition, be able to increasingly provide customizable platform solutions which would impact our ability to compete with them. As our offerings have additionally expanded to adjacent markets, such as integration of messaging into the customer experience platform, sales force automation and platform-based features and functionality, in which we may not have the operational history or familiarity, we may find it difficult to compete with established vendors in those markets. For all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors or retain existing customers, which would harm our business.\nWith respect to larger organizations seeking to deploy a customer service software system, we have many competitors that are larger than us and which have greater name recognition, much longer operating histories, more established customer relationships, larger marketing budgets, and significantly greater resources than we do. For larger organizations, we compete\nwith customer software systems and large enterprise software vendors such as salesforce.com, Inc. and ServiceNow, Inc., each of which may have greater operational flexibility to bundle competing products and services with other software offerings, or offer them at a lower price than our current solutions, which will negatively affect our competitiveness for our solutions. Further, other established SaaS providers not currently focused on the functionality that our solutions provide may expand their services to compete with us as well. Large enterprise software vendors additionally have a greater ability to aggressively price their product at a level below their typical selling price in order to retain their existing customers and gain market share, both within the United States and in regions across the world, decreasing our ability to compete successfully with such vendors.\nIf the market for SaaS business software applications develops more slowly than we expect or declines, our business would be adversely affected.\nThe market for SaaS business software applications is less mature than the market for on-premise business software applications, and the adoption rate of SaaS business software applications may be slower among subscribers in industries with heightened data security interests, business practices requiring highly customizable application software, or large employee bases requiring a high level of sophistication from their business software. Our success will depend to a substantial extent on the widespread adoption of SaaS business applications in general, and of SaaS customer service applications in particular. The expansion of the SaaS business applications market depends on a number of factors, including the cost, performance, and perceived value associated with SaaS, as well as the ability of SaaS providers to address data security and privacy concerns. If SaaS business applications do not continue to achieve market acceptance, if there is a reduction in demand for SaaS business applications caused by a lack of customer acceptance, or if there are technological challenges, weakening economic conditions, data residency, data security or privacy concerns, governmental regulation, competing technologies and products, or decreases in information technology spending, it would result in decreased revenue and our business would be adversely affected.\nWe recognize revenue over the term of our customer contracts. Consequently, downturns or upturns in new sales may not be immediately reflected in our operating results and may be difficult to discern.\nWe generally recognize subscription revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their contracts and a majority of our revenue is derived from subscriptions that have terms longer than one month. As a result, a portion of the revenue we report in each quarter is derived from the recognition of deferred revenue relating to subscriptions entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions with terms that are longer than one month in any single quarter may have a small impact on our revenue results for that quarter. However, such a decline will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our solutions, and potential changes in our pricing policies or rate of expansion or retention, may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. We may also be unable to reduce our cost structure in line with a significant deterioration in sales. In addition, because we believe a substantial percentage of subscriptions to our solutions are shorter than many comparable SaaS companies and because we have many variations of billing cycles, our deferred revenue may be a less meaningful indicator of our future financial results as compared to other SaaS companies. A significant majority of our costs are expensed as incurred, while revenue is recognized over the life of the agreement with the applicable customer. As a result, increased growth in the number of our customers could continue to result in our recognition of more costs than revenue in the earlier periods of the terms of our agreements. Our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription term.\nCertain of our operating results and financial metrics may be difficult to predict as a result of seasonality and usage-based factors.\nWe have experienced, and expect to continue to experience in the future, seasonality in our business, and our operating results and financial condition may be affected by such trends in the future. We generally experience seasonal fluctuations in demand for our solutions and services, and believe that our quarterly sales are affected by industry buying patterns. For example, we have customers who add flexible agents when they need more capacity during busy periods and then subsequently scale back the following year. We believe that the seasonal trends that we have experienced in the past may continue for the foreseeable future, particularly as we expand our sales to larger organizations. Since a large percentage of our subscriptions are monthly, customers are able to increase and decrease the number of authorized agents for whom they require a subscription quickly and easily, thereby potentially increasing the impact of seasonality on our revenue. Further, while not significant, a portion of our revenue results is not subscription-based, such as revenue related to our Talk product or revenue related to professional services, and is primarily dependent on usage-based demand, which can be difficult to predict. Seasonality within our business may be reflected to a much lesser extent, and sometimes may not be immediately apparent, in our revenue, due to the fact that we recognize subscription revenue over the term of our agreement. To the extent we experience this seasonality, it may cause fluctuations in our operating results and financial metrics, and make forecasting our future operating results and\nfinancial metrics difficult. Additionally, we do not have sufficient experience in selling certain of our solutions to determine if demand for these services are or will be subject to material seasonality.\nRisks Related to Customer Retention and Acquisition\nOur business depends substantially on our customers renewing their subscriptions, expanding the use of their subscriptions, and purchasing subscriptions for additional product and platform solutions from us. Any decline in our customer retention or expansion, or any failure by us to sell subscriptions to additional solutions to existing customers, would harm our future operating results.\nIn order for us to maintain or improve our operating results, it is important that our customers renew their subscriptions when the initial contract term expires and add additional authorized agents or additional product and platform solutions to their customer accounts. Even though the majority of our revenue is derived from subscriptions to our solutions that have terms longer than one month, a significant portion of the subscriptions to our solutions have monthly terms. Our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions, and our customers may not renew subscriptions with a similar contract period or with the same or a greater number of agents. Some of our customers elect not to renew their agreements with us and it is difficult to accurately predict long-term customer retention. Because the revenue derived from our customers on contracts with monthly terms are often small and midsized organizations, and because small and midsized organizations can have liquidity and expense limitations more restrictive than large organizations, such revenue is particularly susceptible to changes in global demand arising from economic downturns. Additionally, as we continue to expand our offerings to appeal to larger enterprises and such customers agree to longer contractual terms with subscriptions to additional solutions, if and when such larger enterprise customers decide not to renew their contractual arrangements, the negative impact on our results and operations will accordingly be increasingly larger. Further, a substantial proportion of our revenue derives from, and our future success is substantially dependent on, our ability to expand our existing customers\u2019 use of our solutions by expanding the number of solutions to which such customers subscribe. This has required and will continue to require increasingly sophisticated and costly sales efforts, may not result in additional sales, and it may be difficult to predict the success of such efforts.\nFurther, we have seen the impact of COVID-19 vary significantly across different industries. Certain industries have seen increased demand for their products and services as the needs of the economy shift, while other industries have struggled to maintain demand for their products and services consistent with historical levels. Our ability to retain current customers or sell additional solutions to those customers has and will depend on our ability to understand the short-term and long-term impacts of COVID-19 on each industry. Because we have a limited history in understanding these impacts, our ability to adapt our sales and marketing initiatives to such changes may be uncertain and our ability to forecast rates of customer retention and expansion may be negatively impacted.\nOur customer retention, our ability to sell additional product and platform solutions to existing customers, and the rate at which our existing customers purchase subscriptions to additional solutions may be impacted by a number of factors, including our customers\u2019 satisfaction with our solutions, our product support, our prices, the prices of competing software systems, the effects of global economic conditions, or reductions in our customers\u2019 spending levels. In addition, the rate at which our existing customers purchase subscriptions to additional solutions depends on a number of factors, including the perceived need for additional solutions to build better relationships between organizations and their customers. If our customers do not renew their subscriptions, renew on less favorable terms, fail to add more agents, fail to increase use of our usage-based solutions, or fail to purchase subscriptions to additional solutions, our revenue may decline, and we may not realize improved operating results from our customer base.\nWe face a number of risks in targeting larger organizations for sales of our solutions and, if we do not manage these efforts effectively, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nAs we target a portion of our sales efforts to larger organizations, we expect to incur high costs and long sales cycles, and we may be less effective at predicting when we will complete these sales. In this market segment, the decision to subscribe to one or more of our product and platform solutions may require the approval of a greater number of technical personnel and management levels within a potential customer\u2019s organization than we have historically encountered, and if so, these types of sales would require us to invest more time educating these potential customers on the benefits of our solutions.\nThe success of the broader market acceptance of our product and platform solutions depends on offering solutions designed to give organizations of all sizes the ability to deliver powerful customer experiences with a focus on solutions that have the broadest market appeal across those organizations. Larger organizations may demand more features and integration services than small to midsized organizations. We may not be able to devote sufficient resources to developing those features and functionality in our solutions that are exclusively in demand by large organizations, which may negatively affect our potential sales to those organizations. Further, as we continue to focus on self-serve capabilities and simplicity in buying our\nsolutions, many of those efforts may not be effective in selling and marketing to larger organizations as those organizations may require greater customer-specific investment, which may additionally impact our potential sales to those organizations. To the extent we do invest in customer-specific investment, such investment is and will continue to be a disproportionately large focus of internal resources on a small number of customers, negatively impacting our efficient use of those resources.\nWe have limited experience in developing and managing sales channels and distribution arrangements for larger organizations. We may experience difficulty hiring employees with qualifications appropriate for selling to larger organizations, which could adversely affect our ability to meet expected sales targets. Further, given their generally broader international presence, selling to larger organizations also may require us to divert resources to international regions in which we may not have sufficient personnel, affecting our results of operations. Sales opportunities to larger organizations may require us to devote greater research and development, sales, marketing events, product support, and professional services resources to individual customers, resulting in increased costs and reduced profitability, and would likely lengthen our typical sales cycle, which could strain our resources. Moreover, these transactions may require us to delay recognizing portions of the associated revenue we derive from these customers until any technical or implementation requirements have been met, and larger customers may demand discounts to the subscription prices they pay for our solutions. Furthermore, because we have limited experience selling to larger organizations, our investment in marketing our solutions to these potential customers may not be successful, which could harm our results of operations and our overall ability to grow our customer base. Following sales to larger organizations, we may not fully understand the opportunities to expand usage of our solutions or to sell additional functionality within such organizations, and we may not be able to effectively predict subscription terminations, any of which could harm our results of operations.\nOur business and growth depend substantially on the success of our strategic relationships with third parties, including technology partners, channel partners, and professional services partners.\nWe depend on, and anticipate that we will continue to depend on, various third-party relationships in order to sustain and grow our business. We are highly dependent upon third-party technology partners for certain critical features and functionality of our platform. For example, the features available on Zendesk Talk are highly dependent on our technology integration with products offered by Twilio Inc., the features available on Zendesk Support are highly dependent on our technology integration with products offered by Alphabet Inc., and the features available across our platform are generally dependent on our third-party hosting services and integrations with messaging services. Failure of this or any other technology provider to maintain, support, or secure its technology platforms in general, and our integrations in particular, or errors or defects in its technology, could materially and adversely impact our relationship with our customers, damage our reputation and brand, and harm our business and operating results. Any loss of the right to use any of this hardware or software could result in delays or difficulties in our ability to provide our solutions until equivalent technology is either developed by us or, if available, identified, obtained, and integrated.\nFor deployments of our solutions into complex technology environments and workflows, we are dependent on third-party implementation consultants to provide professional services to our customers. The failure of these third-party consultants to perform their services adequately may disrupt or damage the relationship between us and our customers, damage our brand, and harm our business.\nIdentifying, negotiating, and documenting relationships with strategic third parties such as technology partners and implementation providers requires significant time and resources. In addition, integrating third-party technology is complex, costly, and time-consuming. Our agreements with technology partners and implementation providers are typically limited in duration, non-exclusive, and do not prohibit them from working with our competitors or from offering competing services. Our competitors may be effective in providing incentives to third parties to favor their solutions or services or to prevent or reduce subscriptions to our solutions.\nIf we are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining our relationships with these strategic third parties, our ability to compete in the marketplace or to grow our revenue could be impaired and our operating results would suffer. Even if we are successful, we cannot assure you that these relationships will result in improved operating results.\nWe employ a pricing model that subjects us to various challenges that could make it difficult for us to derive sufficient value from our customers particularly because we do not have the history with our subscription or pricing models that we need to accurately predict optimal pricing necessary to attract and retain customers.\nWe generally charge our customers for their use of our product and platform solutions based on the number of users they enable as 'agents' under their customer account, as well as the features and functionality enabled. The features and functionality we provide within our solutions enable our customers to promote customer self-service and otherwise efficiently and cost-effectively address product support requests without the need for substantial human interaction. As a result of these features, customer agent staffing requirements may be minimized and our revenue may be adversely impacted. Conversely, customers\nmay overestimate their agent needs when they initially use our solutions, negatively affecting our ability to accurately forecast the number of agents our customers need in a period. Other than subscriptions related to the Zendesk Suite, we generally require a separate subscription to enable the functionality of each of our solutions. We are continuing to analyze and improve our pricing and packaging models as we adapt to a changing market, but we do not know whether our current or potential customers or the market in general will accept changes to those models and, if it fails to gain acceptance, our business and results of operations could be harmed. In particular, in February 2021, we released a new version of our omnichannel offering, the Zendesk Suite, which offers access to Support, Chat, Talk, Guide, Explore, and Sunshine at new, unified purchase plans with various levels of pricing for different types of organizations. While we believe that simple purchase plans will enable greater adoption of the Zendesk Suite, certain organizations, such as small or midsized businesses, may not want to purchase all the included solutions in the Zendesk Suite, and other organizations may want more features offered in one solution without paying for the next purchase plan level, affecting our new business, retention, and sales for additional solutions. Those purchasing decisions will be difficult to predict due to our limited experience offering the new Zendesk Suite, and we may not fully understand the impact of our pricing changes in the market. If we fail to find an optimal pricing strategy for our latest offering, our business and results of operations may be harmed. If customers do not accept our new purchase plans, we may increasingly have difficulty in our ability to attract new customers as well as our ability to retain existing customers to the extent we apply new pricing models to existing customer agreements. Our current pricing model may be either too complex, too simple, or too expensive depending on the size of the organization to which we are selling our offering. Pricing decisions may also impact the mix of adoption among our subscription plans and negatively impact our overall revenue. Moreover, larger organizations may demand substantial price concessions. As a result, in the future we may be required to reduce our prices or develop new pricing models, which could adversely affect our revenue, gross margin, profitability, financial position, and cash flow.\nFinally, as the market for our solutions matures, or as new competitors introduce new solutions or services that compete with ours, we may be unable to attract new customers at the same price or based on the same pricing models as we have used historically.\nOur terms of service generally prohibit the sharing of user logins and passwords. These restrictions may be improperly circumvented or otherwise bypassed by certain users and, if they are, we may not be able to capture the full value of the use of our solutions. We provide access and use of our solutions exclusively for our customers\u2019 internal use. If customers improperly resell or otherwise make our solutions available to their customers, it may cannibalize our sales or commoditize our solutions in the market. Additionally, if a customer that has received a volume discount from us offers our solutions to its customers in violation of our terms of service, we may experience price erosion and be unable to capture sufficient value from the use of our solutions by those customers.\nWhile our terms of service provide us the ability to enforce our terms, our customers may resist or refuse to allow us to audit their usage, in which case we may have to pursue legal recourse to enforce our rights. Any such enforcement action would require us to spend money, distract management, and potentially adversely affect our relationship with our customers.\nWe are highly dependent upon free trials of our solutions and other inbound lead generation strategies to drive our sales and revenue. If these strategies fail to continue to generate sales opportunities or do not convert into paying customers, our business and results of operations would be harmed.\nWe are highly dependent upon our marketing strategy of offering free trials of our solutions and other inbound lead generation strategies to generate sales opportunities. As we increasingly focus on our core strengths of simplicity, agility, and offering solutions that are easy to adopt, it will be additionally increasingly critical to maintain a simple trial experience that markets and leads to an easy adoption of our solutions. These strategies may not be successful in continuing to generate sufficient sales opportunities necessary to increase our revenue. Many early users never convert from the trial version of a solution to a paid version of such solution. We often depend on individuals within an organization who initiate the trial versions of our solutions being able to convince decision makers within their organization to convert to a paid version. Many of these organizations increasingly have complex and multi-layered purchasing requirements, especially the larger organizations that we continue to target. Furthermore, in the case of our sales force automation software and features and functionality related to our platform offering, we are increasingly pursuing decision makers that are not in the customer support organizations that we have traditionally targeted. Additionally, as we offer new, broader pricing and packaging offerings for our solutions, we may not be able to understand how our prospective customers trial and use each individual solution, negatively affecting our ability to sell additional solutions effectively to those organizations. To the extent that these users do not become, or are unable to convince others to become, paying customers, we will not realize the intended benefits of this marketing strategy and our ability to grow our revenue will be adversely affected.\nAny failure to offer high-quality product support or customer success initiatives may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and our financial results.\nIn deploying and using our product and platform solutions, our customers depend on our product support team, customer success organization, and our professional services organization to resolve complex technical and operational issues. We may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short-term increases in customer demand for product support. We also may be unable to modify the nature, scope, and delivery of our product support to compete with changes in product support services provided by our competitors. Increased customer demand for product support, without corresponding revenue, could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results. Adoption of the Zendesk Suite and increasing usage by customers of multiple solutions may additionally increase demand on our product support team and customer success organizations. We may allocate resources to support such increased demand and, as a consequence, our support of any individual solution may suffer. Additionally, we may be unable to develop our customer success organization to continue to support the increasing level of complexity that our customers that are large organizations require while maintaining the same level of engagement across all customers. For example, adoption of features and functionality related to our platform offering may increase demand on our professional services organization as customers may increasingly demand platform-related features that may not currently exist.\nOur sales are highly dependent on our business reputation and on positive recommendations from our existing customers. Any failure to maintain high-quality product support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality product support, maintain a high complexity customer success organization, or maintain an adaptive and responsive professional services organization, could adversely affect our reputation, our ability to sell our solutions to existing and prospective customers, and our business, operating results, and financial position.\nIf we are unable to develop and maintain successful relationships with channel partners, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nTo date, we have been primarily dependent on our direct sales force to sell subscriptions to our product and platform solutions. Although we have developed certain channel partners, such as referral partners, resellers, and integration partners, these channels have resulted in limited revenue to date. We believe identifying, developing, and maintaining strategic relationships with additional channel partners are important to driving revenue growth for our company, and we will continue to dedicate resources to those efforts. Our agreements with our existing channel partners are non-exclusive, meaning our channel partners may offer customers the solutions of several different companies, including solutions that compete with ours. They may also cease marketing our solutions with limited or no notice and with little or no penalty. We expect that any additional channel partners we identify and develop will be similarly non-exclusive and not bound by any requirement to continue to market our solutions. If we fail to identify additional channel partners, in a timely and cost-effective manner, or at all, or are unable to assist our current and future channel partners in independently selling and deploying our solutions, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected. Additionally, customer retention and expansion attributable to customers acquired through our channel partners may differ significantly from customers acquired through our direct sales efforts. If our channel partners do not effectively market and sell our solutions, or fail to meet the needs of our customers, our reputation and ability to grow our business may also be adversely affected.\nSales by channel partners are more likely than direct sales to involve collectability concerns. In particular, sales by our channel partners into developing markets, and accordingly, variations in the mix between revenue attributable to sales by channel partners and revenue attributable to direct sales, may result in fluctuations in our operating results.\nIf we are not able to maintain and enhance our brand, our business, operating results, and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nWe believe that maintaining and enhancing our reputation as a differentiated and category-defining company in customer experience solutions is critical to our relationships with our existing customers and to our ability to attract new customers. The successful promotion of our brand attributes will depend on a number of factors, including our marketing efforts, our ability to continue to develop high-quality software, and our ability to successfully differentiate our product and platform solutions from competitive solutions and services. Our ability to maintain our brand will depend on ensuring we communicate our core strengths in simplicity, agility of our solutions, and easy adoption of sophisticated solutions to our prospective customers, particularly as compared to our competitors offering products to small and midsized organizations and other competitors offering products to larger organizations. We are and have been highly dependent upon \u201cconsumer\u201d tactics to build our brand and develop brand loyalty, but may need to increasingly spend significant energy to develop branding to retain and increase brand recognition with our customers who are larger organizations. In addition, independent industry analysts often provide reviews of our solutions, as well as products and services offered by our competitors, and perception of our solutions in the marketplace may be significantly influenced by these reviews. If these reviews are negative, or less positive as compared to those of our competitors\u2019 products and services, our brand may be adversely affected. It may also be difficult to maintain and\nenhance our brand, specifically following the launch of our updated corporate brand, in connection with sales through channel or strategic partners.\nThe promotion of our brand requires us to make substantial expenditures, and we anticipate that these expenditures will continue to increase, as our market becomes more competitive, as we expand into new markets, and as more sales are generated through our channel partners. To the extent that these activities yield increased revenue, this revenue may not offset the increased expenses we incur. If we do not successfully maintain and enhance our brand, our business may not grow, we may have reduced pricing power relative to competitors, and we could lose customers or fail to attract potential customers, all of which would adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Operating and Growing a Global Business\nOur quarterly results may fluctuate significantly from period to period, and if we fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors, our stock price and the value of an investment in our common stock could decline substantially.\nOur quarterly financial results may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. If our quarterly financial results fall below the expectations of investors or any securities analysts who follow our stock, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. Some of the important factors that may cause our revenue, operating results, and cash flows to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include:\n\u2022the short-term and long-term impacts of COVID-19 or any other worldwide pandemic on our business, including but not limited to a decreased demand for our solutions and services, particularly in certain industries, negative impacts on our revenue results, and an increased unpredictability in expenses and cash flow;\n\u2022our ability to attract new customers, retain and increase sales to existing customers, and satisfy our customers\u2019 requirements;\n\u2022the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures related to the operations and expansion of our business;\n\u2022the rate of expansion and productivity of our sales force;\n\u2022general economic conditions that may adversely affect either our customers\u2019 ability or willingness to purchase additional subscriptions, delay a prospective customer\u2019s purchasing decision, reduce the value of new subscription contracts, or affect customer retention;\n\u2022changes in our or our competitors\u2019 pricing policies;\n\u2022the impact of security breaches, service interruptions, or other technical difficulties or reliability considerations on our solutions;\n\u2022our ability to meet the increasing expectations on product functionality of larger organizations while continuing to maintain an easily accessible solution for organizations of all sizes;\n\u2022changes in our billing and invoicing policies and customer reception of those changes;\n\u2022our investments in and our ability to successfully sell newly developed or acquired products, features, or functionality;\n\u2022increasing efforts by our customers to develop native applications as a substitute for our own;\n\u2022the timing of customer payments and payment defaults by customers;\n\u2022the timing of the grant, price of our common stock, or vesting of equity awards to employees;\n\u2022expenses such as litigation or other dispute-related settlement payments;\n\u2022changes in foreign currency exchange rates and our customers' willingness to accept the risk of those changes; and\n\u2022the impact of new accounting pronouncements.\nMany of these factors are outside of our control, and the occurrence of one or more of them might cause our revenue, operating results, cash flows, gross margin, operating margin, profitability, unearned revenue, and remaining revenue performance obligations, to vary widely. As such, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our revenue, operating results, and cash flows may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance.\nFailure to effectively maintain and scale our sales capabilities could harm our ability to increase our customer base and achieve broader market acceptance of our product and platform solutions.\nIncreasing our customer base and achieving broader market acceptance of our product and platform solutions will depend, to a significant extent, on our ability to effectively maintain and scale our sales and marketing operations and activities. We are substantially dependent on our direct sales force to obtain certain of our new customers, including larger organizations. We plan to continue to invest in our direct sales force both domestically and internationally to increase the effectiveness of our sales motions and increase our sales capacity. During the year ended December 31, 2021, our sales and marketing organization increased by approximately 700 employees to approximately 2,340 employees. There is significant competition for experienced\nsales and marketing professionals with the skills and technical knowledge that we require, both domestically and internationally. Our ability to achieve significant revenue growth in the future will depend, in part, on our success in recruiting, training, and retaining a sufficient number of experienced sales and marketing professionals. New hires require significant training and time before they achieve full productivity, particularly in new sales segments and territories. In territories outside the United States, attraction, recruiting and retention of our sales personnel has been and will be increasingly difficult and costly, affecting our ability to compete in such jurisdictions. Further, as organizations worldwide adjust to continuing precautions and safety measures related to decreasing the health risks of COVID-19, our ability to connect in person with our customers and potential customers may be and has been negatively impacted, resulting in delayed sales cycles.\nWe cannot predict whether, or to what extent, our sales will increase as we continue to invest in our sales and marketing functions or how long it will take for new personnel to become productive, continue to focus on our core strengths, and achieve broader market acceptance. Our business will be harmed if our sales and marketing efforts do not generate a significant increase in revenue.\nWe depend on our executive officers and other key employees and the loss of one or more of these employees or an inability to attract and retain highly skilled employees could adversely affect our business.\nOur success depends largely upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key employees. We rely on our leadership team and on individual contributors in the areas of research and development, operations, security, sales, marketing, support, and general and administrative functions. From time to time, there may be changes in our executive management team resulting from the hiring, departure, or reorganization of our executive team, which could disrupt our business.\nWe do not have employment agreements with our executive officers or other key personnel that require them to continue to work for us for any specified period of time and, therefore, they could terminate their employment with us at any time. The loss of one or more of our executive officers, especially our Chief Executive Officer, or other key employees globally could have an adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition, to execute on our growth plan, we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel. Competition for these personnel in the San Francisco Bay Area, where our headquarters is located, and in other locations where we maintain offices, especially in Dublin, Ireland and Singapore is intense, especially for engineers experienced in designing and developing software and SaaS applications and experienced sales professionals. As organizations increasingly promote digital-first employee experiences and seek to hire across multiple jurisdictions, we will additionally face competition in hiring qualified employees in areas outside our physical offices.\nWe have, from time to time, experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining employees with appropriate qualifications. For example, certain domestic immigration laws restrict or limit our ability to recruit internationally. Any changes to U.S. immigration policies that restrain the flow of technical and professional talent may inhibit our ability to recruit and retain highly qualified employees. Additionally, many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have. If we hire employees from competitors or other companies, their former employers may attempt to assert that these employees or we have breached their legal obligations, resulting in a diversion of our time and resources. In addition, job candidates and existing employees often consider the value of the equity awards they receive in connection with their employment. If the perceived or actual value of our equity awards declines, it may adversely affect our ability to recruit and retain highly skilled employees. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to effectively manage our growth and organizational change in a manner that preserves the key aspects of our culture, our business and operating results could be harmed.\nWe have experienced and may continue to experience rapid growth and organizational change, which has placed, and may continue to place, significant demands on our management, operational, and financial resources. For example, our headcount has grown from approximately 4,130 employees as of December 31, 2020 to approximately 5,860 employees as of December 31, 2021. In addition, we have established subsidiaries in Denmark, the United Kingdom, Australia, Ireland, Japan, the Philippines, Brazil, Germany, India, Mexico, and South Korea since our inception in 2007, and, as a result of acquisitions, we also have subsidiaries in Singapore, France, Poland, Portugal, and Canada. We may continue to invest in our international operations and expand into other countries in the future. We have also experienced significant growth in the number of customers, end users, transactions, and data that our solutions support. Our organizational structure is becoming more complex and we may need to scale and adapt our operational, financial, and management controls, as well as our reporting systems and procedures, to manage this complexity. Further, as our employees work from geographic areas across the globe, we will require investment of resources and close monitoring of local regulations and requirements that continually change due to events that may have a global impact, such as the shift to remote work or hybrid remote and in-office models arising from the COVID-19\npandemic, and we may experience unpredictability in our expenses, employee retention, and employee work culture. We will require significant capital expenditures and the allocation of valuable management resources to grow and change in these areas without undermining our corporate culture of rapid innovation, simplicity in design, and attention to customer experience that has been critical to our growth so far. If we fail to manage our anticipated growth and change in a manner that preserves the key aspects of our culture, the retention and productivity of our employees may be impacted, and the quality of our solutions and services may suffer, which could negatively affect our brand and reputation and harm our ability to retain and attract customers.\nWe have a history of losses and we expect our revenue growth rate to decline. As our costs increase, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to achieve and sustain our profitability.\nWe have incurred net losses in each year since our inception, including net losses of $62 million and $70 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and net losses of $224 million and $218 million for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We had an accumulated deficit of $1,140 million as of December 31, 2021. For the three months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, our revenue was $375 million and $283 million, respectively, representing a 32% growth rate. For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, our revenue was $1,339 million and $1,030 million, respectively, representing a 30% growth rate. Our historical revenue growth has been inconsistent and should not be considered indicative of our future performance. We expect that our revenue growth rate will decline over time. We may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to achieve and sustain profitability as we also expect our costs to increase in future periods. We expect to continue to expend substantial financial and other resources on:\n\u2022development of our existing product and platform solutions or acquisition of new product and platform solutions to appeal to as many types and sizes of organizations as possible, including investments in our research and development team and improvements to the scalability, availability, and security of our solutions;\n\u2022continued international investment in an effort to increase our customer base and sales;\n\u2022investments in programs to ensure retention of current customers and expansion of use cases for our products with those customers;\n\u2022enhancements to our network operations and infrastructure;\n\u2022sales and marketing; and\n\u2022general administration, including legal, accounting, and other expenses related to being a public company.\nThese investments may not result in increased revenue or growth of our business. If we fail to continue to grow our revenue, our operating results and business would be harmed.\nOur international sales and operations subject us to additional risks that can adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nIn the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we derived 49% and 48%, respectively, of our revenue from customers located outside of the United States. We are continuing to invest in our international operations as part of our growth strategy. We currently have sales personnel and sales and product support operations in certain countries across North America, Europe, Australia, Asia, and South America. To date, a limited portion of our sales has been driven by resellers or other channel partners. We believe our ability to convince new customers to subscribe to our solutions or to convince existing customers to renew or expand their use of our solutions is directly correlated to the level of engagement we obtain with the customer. To the extent we are unable to effectively engage with non-U.S. customers due to our limited sales force capacity and limited channel partners, we may be unable to effectively grow in international markets.\nOur international operations subject us to a variety of additional risks and challenges, including:\n\u2022economic conditions in each country or region and general economic uncertainty around the world;\n\u2022the need for sales representatives to be recruited, hired, and retained locally in increasing numbers of countries abroad;\n\u2022communication and integration problems related to entering new markets with different languages, cultures, and political systems, particularly in regions with a high level of such differences between each country;\n\u2022compliance with foreign privacy and security laws and regulations and the risks and costs of non-compliance;\n\u2022the need for localized software and licensing programs, including the need for localized language support and data residency requirements;\n\u2022burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws, including laws related to marketing restrictions and other data privacy regulations;\n\u2022increased management, travel, visa compliance, infrastructure, and legal compliance costs associated with having multiple international operations;\n\u2022longer payment cycles and difficulties in enforcing contracts, collecting accounts receivable, or satisfying revenue recognition criteria, especially in emerging markets;\n\u2022differing technical standards, existing or future regulatory and certification requirements and required features and functionality;\n\u2022exposure to political developments in the United Kingdom (\u201cU.K.\u201d), including the departure of the U.K. from the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) on January 31, 2021 (\u201cBrexit\u201d), which has created an uncertain political, economic and regulatory environment, instability for businesses, and volatility in global financial markets and the value of foreign currencies, all of which could disrupt trade, the sale of our services, and the mobility of our employees and contractors between the U.K., EU and other jurisdictions;\n\u2022compliance with laws and regulations for foreign operations, including anti-bribery laws (such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, the U.S. Travel Act, and the U.K. Bribery Act 2010), import and export controls laws, tariffs, trade barriers, economic sanctions, anti-slavery laws, and other regulatory or contractual limitations on our ability to sell our solutions in certain foreign markets, and the risks and costs of non-compliance;\n\u2022heightened risks of unfair or corrupt business practices in certain geographies and of improper or fraudulent sales arrangements that may impact our financial results and result in restatements of our consolidated financial statements;\n\u2022fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and the related effect on our operating results, particularly as our customers increasingly demand less exposure to such fluctuations;\n\u2022difficulties in repatriating or transferring funds from or converting currencies in certain countries;\n\u2022requirements or preferences for domestic products;\n\u2022differing labor standards, including restrictions related to, and the increased cost of, terminating employees in some countries;\n\u2022reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries and practical difficulties of enforcing rights abroad;\n\u2022compliance with the laws of numerous foreign tax jurisdictions, including withholding obligations, and overlapping of different tax regimes; and\n\u2022the impact of natural disasters, diseases and pandemics, such as COVID-19, and travel restrictions and other measures undertaken by governments in response to such issues.\nAny of these risks could adversely affect our international operations, reduce our international revenue, or increase our operating costs, adversely affecting our business, operating results, financial condition, and growth prospects.\nCompliance with laws and regulations applicable to our international operations substantially increases our cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. We may be unable to keep current with new or revised government requirements as they change from time to time. Failure to comply with these regulations could have adverse effects on our business. Additionally, in many foreign countries it is common for others to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or U.S. or other regulations applicable to us. Although we have implemented certain policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and policies, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, contractors, partners, and agents will comply with these laws and policies. Violations of laws or key control policies by our employees, contractors, partners, or agents could result in delays in revenue recognition, financial reporting misstatements, enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, fines, civil and criminal penalties, damages, injunctions, other collateral consequences, or the prohibition of the importation or exportation of our solutions and services, and could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe may acquire or invest in companies, which may divert our management\u2019s attention and result in additional dilution to our stockholders. We may be unable to integrate acquired businesses and technologies successfully or achieve the expected benefits of such acquisitions.\nWe may evaluate and consider potential strategic transactions, including acquisitions of, or investments in, businesses, technologies, services, product and platform solutions, and other assets in the future. We also may enter into relationships with other businesses to expand our solutions and services, which could involve preferred or exclusive licenses, additional channels of distribution, discount pricing, or investments in other companies.\nAny acquisition, investment, or business relationship may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. In particular, we may encounter difficulties assimilating or integrating the business strategy, sales plans, technologies, products, personnel, or operations of the acquired companies, particularly if the key personnel of the acquired company choose not to work for us, their software is not easily adapted to work with our solutions, or we have difficulty retaining the customers of any acquired business due to changes in ownership, management, customers' experience with the acquired company prior to acquisition, or otherwise. Acquisitions may also disrupt our business, divert our resources, and require significant management attention that would otherwise be available for development of our existing business. Moreover, the anticipated benefits of any acquisition, investment, or business relationship may not be realized or we may be exposed to unknown risks or liabilities.\nNegotiating these transactions can be time-consuming, difficult, and expensive, and our ability to complete these transactions may often be subject to approvals that are beyond our control. Consequently, these transactions, even if announced, may not be completed. For one or more of these transactions, we may:\n\u2022issue additional equity securities that would dilute our existing stockholders;\n\u2022use cash that we may need in the future to operate our business;\n\u2022encounter difficulties retaining key employees of the acquired company or integrating diverse software codes or business cultures;\n\u2022incur large charges or substantial liabilities;\n\u2022incur debt on terms unfavorable to us or that we are unable to repay;\n\u2022divert our resources to understand and comply with new jurisdictions if such acquired company is in a new country; and/or\n\u2022become subject to adverse tax consequences, substantial depreciation, or deferred compensation charges.\nOur financial results may fluctuate due to increasing variability in our sales cycles.\nWe plan our expenses based on certain assumptions about the length and variability of our sales cycle. These assumptions are based upon historical trends for sales cycles and conversion rates associated with our existing customers, many of whom to date have been small to midsized organizations that make purchasing decisions with limited interaction with our sales or other personnel. As we continue to sell to larger organizations, we expect our sales cycles to those organizations to lengthen and become less predictable. This may adversely affect our financial results. Factors that may influence the length and variability of our sales cycle include:\n\u2022the competitive nature of evaluation and purchasing processes;\n\u2022the need to educate prospective customers about the uses and benefits of our product and platform solutions;\n\u2022the discretionary nature of purchasing and budget cycles and decisions;\n\u2022announcements or planned introductions of new solutions, features, or functionality by us or our competitors; and\n\u2022lengthy purchasing approval processes.\nIf we are unable to close one or more expected significant transactions with these customers in a particular period, or if an expected transaction is delayed until a subsequent period, our operating results for that period, and for any future periods in which revenue from such transaction would otherwise have been recognized, may be adversely affected.\nAdditionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has, and may continue to, put pressure on global economic conditions and overall spending for customer experience solutions, and may cause our customers or their customers to modify spending priorities or delay or abandon purchasing decisions, thereby lengthening sales cycles, and may make it difficult for us to forecast our sales and operating results. Further, as the pandemic continues, organizations that previously delayed their purchasing decision may later purchase our solutions on a timeline not consistent with historical patterns, negatively impacting our ability to accurately forecast such decisions and sales results.\nWe are subject to governmental sanctions restrictions and export and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in international markets or subject us to liability if we violate the controls.\nWe incorporate encryption technology into our solutions that is enabled through mobile applications and other software we may be deemed to export, and therefore we may be subject to U.S. export controls and economic sanctions regulations. These encryption solutions and the underlying technology may be exported outside of the U.S. only with the required export authorizations, including by license, a license exception, or other appropriate government authorizations. We previously deployed mobile applications prior to obtaining the required export authorizations. Accordingly, we have not fully complied with applicable encryption controls in U.S. export administration regulations.\nFurthermore, U.S. export controls laws and economic sanctions prohibit the shipment or provision of certain products and services to countries, governments, territories, and persons targeted by U.S. sanctions. While we are currently taking precautions to prevent our solutions from being enabled by persons targeted by U.S. sanctions, including IP blocking and periodic customer screening against U.S. government lists of prohibited persons, such measures may be circumvented. Given the technical limitations in developing measures that will prevent access to internet-based services from particular geographies or by particular individuals, we have previously identified and expect we will continue to identify customer accounts for our solutions that we suspect originate from countries or parties which are subject to U.S. sanctions restrictions.\nWe are aware that trials of and subscriptions to our solutions have been initiated by persons and organizations in countries that are the subject of U.S. embargoes, or to persons and organizations supporting customers in countries that are the subject of U.S. embargoes, or to parties which are subject to targeted export and sanctions restrictions. Our provision of\nservices in these instances was likely in violation of U.S. export controls and sanctions laws. We have terminated the accounts of such organizations as we have become aware of them, implemented certain measures designed to prevent future unauthorized access by such persons and organizations, and filed voluntary self-disclosures with the U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s Bureau of Industry and Security, or BIS, and the U.S. Department of Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, concerning prior potential violations. With respect to these resolved matters, each of BIS and OFAC completed its investigations, and no monetary penalties or other sanctions were imposed. With respect to future matters, there is the potential for the government to impose fines or sanctions.\nIf we are found to be in violation of U.S. sanctions or export controls laws, it could result in fines or penalties for us and for individuals, including civil penalties of approximately $300,000 or twice the value of the transaction, whichever is greater, per violation, and in the event of conviction for a criminal violation, fines of up to $1 million and possible incarceration for responsible employees and managers for willful and knowing violations.\nIf our channel partners fail to obtain appropriate import, export, or re-export licenses or permits, we may also be adversely affected, through reputational harm as well as other negative consequences, including government investigations and penalties. We presently incorporate sanctions compliance requirements in our channel partner agreements for our solutions. Complying with export controls and sanctions regulations for a particular sale may be time-consuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities. Failure to comply with export controls and sanctions regulations for a particular sale may expose us to government investigations and penalties, which could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nIn addition, various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology, including import permitting and licensing requirements, and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to offer or distribute our solutions or could limit our customers\u2019 ability to implement our solutions in those countries. Changes in our solutions or future changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction of our solutions in international markets or prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our solutions globally. Any change in export or import regulations, economic sanctions, or related legislation, or change in the countries, governments, persons, or technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of our solutions by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell our solutions to, existing or potential customers with international operations. Any decreased use of our solutions or limitation on our ability to export or sell our solutions would likely adversely affect our business operations and financial results.\nWe may not be able to secure additional financing on favorable terms, or at all, to meet our future capital needs.\nWe have funded our operations since inception primarily through customer payments for subscription services, the issuance of our convertible senior notes, and public and private equity financings. In the future, we may require additional capital to respond to business opportunities, challenges, acquisitions, a decline in the level of subscriptions for our solutions, or unforeseen circumstances. We may not be able to timely secure additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms, or at all. Any additional debt financing obtained by us could involve restrictive covenants relating to financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. Additionally, we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service any debt financing obtained by us, which may force us to reduce or delay capital expenditures or sell assets or operations. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity, convertible debt securities, or other securities convertible into equity, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution in their percentage ownership of our company, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to grow or support our business and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited.\nRisks Related to Cybersecurity, Reliability, and Data Privacy\nOur network and computer systems have been breached in the past. In light of prior incidents, and in the event that we are subject to any future breaches or we learn that the extent of prior breaches are more significant than is currently known, our solutions may be perceived as insecure, we may lose existing customers or fail to attract new customers, and we may incur significant liabilities.\nThe continued growth in sales of our services and solutions and customer retention are increasingly dependent on the trust of existing customers in and the perception by potential customers of the secure and reliable use of our solutions. As we develop our product and platform solutions to reflect our core strengths of simplicity, agility, and transparency in the customer experience for organizations of all sizes, we will continue to focus on developing a product and information security program that minimizes vulnerabilities and protects our customers\u2019 data. If we fail to meet our customers\u2019 expectations in maintaining\nthat trust, our customer retention will decrease, our perception in the market will be harmed, and our results of operations will be negatively affected.\nUse of our product and platform solutions involves the storage, transmission, and processing of our customers\u2019 proprietary data, including personally identifiable information and other sensitive data regarding their customers or employees. Unauthorized access to, or disclosure, compromise, destruction, alteration or corruption of, such information or security breaches of our solutions, or our service providers' solutions, could result in the loss of data, loss of intellectual property or trade secrets, loss of business, severe reputational damage adversely affecting customer and investor confidence, disruption to our business, regulatory investigations and orders, litigation, or indemnity obligations, or other legal, regulatory, and financial exposure and liability. If our network or computer systems are breached or unauthorized access to customer data is otherwise obtained, we may be held responsible for damages for contract breach, or be subjected to penalties for violation of applicable laws and regulations and we could incur significant costs for remediation that may include liability for stolen assets or information and repair of system damage that may have been caused, incentives offered to customers or other business partners in an effort to maintain business relationships after a breach, and other liabilities. Furthermore, security breaches of our solutions could make it easier for malicious third parties to discover vulnerabilities in such solutions or allow our competitors to create similar solutions with decreased development effort, harming our competitive position. Notifications related to a security breach regarding or pertaining to any of such service providers have impacted and could in the future impact our reputation, harm customer confidence, hurt our sales and expansion into new markets, or cause us to lose existing customers.\nWe have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, significant expenses to prevent, investigate, and remediate security breaches and vulnerabilities, including deploying additional personnel and protection technologies, implementing increasingly mature processes and programs, hiring and training employees, and engaging third-party experts and consultants. Our errors and omissions insurance coverage covering certain security and privacy damages and claim expenses may not be sufficient to compensate for all liability related to or arising out of any security incidents.\nWe have previously experienced significant data breaches and security incidents. We have also previously identified major vulnerabilities of our security measures and the security measures deployed by third-party vendors upon which we rely, and our solutions have been and may continue to be at risk for future breaches as a result of third-party action against ourselves or our vendors, employee, vendor, or contractor error, malfeasance, or other factors. In light of prior incidents, and in the event that we are subject to any future breaches or we learn that the extent of prior incidents is more significant than is currently known, our solutions may be perceived as insecure, we may lose existing customers or fail to attract new customers, and we may incur significant liabilities.\nIn addition, new solutions and services, including newly acquired solutions and services, may rely on systems, networks, personnel, equipment, and vendors that may initially be different from those utilized in connection with our existing solutions and which may not have been subject to the same security reviews and assessments as those used to provide our existing solutions. Any failure to complete these security reviews and assessments and to implement improvements to the security measures deployed to protect our new solutions in a timely manner could increase our risk of a security breach with respect to these solutions, which would harm our reputation and our business as a whole.\nCyber incidents have been increasing in sophistication and frequency, increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. Such incidents can include third parties gaining access to employee or customer data using stolen or inferred credentials, computer malware, exploiting vulnerabilities in hardware, software, or other infrastructure, social engineering techniques, viruses, spamming, phishing attacks, ransomware, card skimming code, and other deliberate attacks and attempts to gain unauthorized access. Additionally, our continued use of remote work environments and virtual platforms may also increase our cybersecurity vulnerabilities and risks. Because the techniques used and vulnerabilities exploited to obtain unauthorized access to or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not identified until they are launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or vulnerabilities or to implement adequate preventative measures. We may also experience security breaches that may remain undetected for an extended period.\nData security is a critical competitive factor in our industry, therefore, we make numerous statements in our legal documents, public facing documents, privacy policies, terms of service, and data processing agreements, through our certifications to privacy standards, and in our marketing materials, providing assurances about the security of our solutions, including detailed descriptions of security measures we employ. Should any of these statements be untrue or become untrue, even due to circumstances beyond our reasonable control, we may face claims of misrepresentation or deceptiveness by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, state and foreign regulators, and private litigants.\nInterruptions or performance problems associated with our technology and infrastructure may adversely affect our business and operating results.\nOur continued growth depends in part on the ability of our existing and potential customers to access our solutions at any time and within an acceptable amount of time. Our solutions are proprietary, and we rely on the expertise of members of our\nengineering, operations, and software development teams for their continued performance. We have experienced, and may in the future continue to experience, disruptions, outages, and other performance problems due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, introductions of new functionality, human or software errors, capacity constraints due to an overwhelming number of users simultaneously accessing our solutions, distributed denial of service attacks, or other security related incidents, which may affect and have affected our perception of reliability with customers. In some instances, we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these performance problems within an acceptable period of time. It may become increasingly difficult to maintain and improve our performance, especially during peak usage times and as our solutions become more complex and our user traffic increases. If any of our solutions are unavailable or if our users are unable to access our solutions within a reasonable amount of time or at all, impacted existing customers may decide to not renew or expand usage of our solutions, and new customers who hear of such disruptions may as a result decide to not purchase our solutions, negatively affecting our business. In addition, a significant portion of our infrastructure does not implement multi-region data replication. Therefore, in the event of any of the factors described above, or certain other failures of our infrastructure, customer data may be and have been permanently lost. Moreover, some of our customer agreements and certain subscription plans include performance guarantees and service level standards that obligate us to provide credits or termination rights in the event of a significant disruption in our services. To the extent that we do not effectively address capacity constraints, upgrade our systems as needed, and continually develop our technology and network architecture to accommodate actual and anticipated changes in technology, our business and operating results may be adversely affected.\nWe rely substantially on third-party managed hosting services to support our operations and disruption or interference in such service may negatively impact our business.\nGiven that we are significantly reliant on third-party managed hosting services, any significant disruption of or interference in our use of such services will negatively impact our operations and customer satisfaction. Third-party managed hosting services may additionally take actions beyond our control that could seriously harm our business, including discontinuing or limiting our access to the service, increasing price terms, including establishing more favorable relationships or pricing terms with one or more of our competitors, maintaining control over the pricing models of those hosting services for when customers experience unique spikes in demand and usage, terminating or seeking to terminate the contractual relationship altogether, or modifying or interpreting its terms of service or other policies in a manner that impacts our ability to run our businesses and operations. Different types of challenges may arise from our various solutions' usage of third-party hosting services, and if we are not able to provide a seamless experience contemporaneously across our solutions, our reputation and perception of reliability may be negatively impacted, and our customer retention and prospective business may be harmed.\nWe have made and will continue to make substantial expenditures for third-party managed hosting services to support our growth and provide enhanced levels of service to our customers. If costs associated with third-party managed hosting services utilized to support our growth are greater than expected, the negative impact on our operating results would likely exceed our initial expectations.\nDomestic and international privacy and data security concerns and laws could result in additional costs and liabilities to us or inhibit sales of our solutions.\nThe regulatory framework for privacy and security concerns and laws worldwide are rapidly evolving and are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. Many federal, state, and foreign government bodies and agencies have adopted, or are considering adopting, laws and regulations regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information. In the United States, these include rules and regulations promulgated under the authority of federal agencies and state attorneys general and consumer protection agencies. Certain state laws may be more stringent or broader in scope, or offer greater individual rights, with respect to sensitive and personal information than federal or other state laws, and such laws may differ from each other, which may complicate compliance efforts. For example, in 2018, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which went into effect in January 2020 and became enforceable by the California Attorney General in July 2020. The CCPA established certain transparency requirements and individual rights and, among other things, requires companies covered by the legislation to provide new disclosures to California consumers and afford such consumers new rights with respect to their personal information, including the right to request deletion of their personal information, the right to receive the personal information on record for them, the right to know what categories of personal information generally are maintained about them, as well as the right to opt-out of certain sales of personal information. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for certain data breaches that result in the loss of personal information. This private right of action may increase the likelihood of, and risks associated with, data breach litigation.\nAdditionally, a new California ballot initiative, the California Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA, was passed in November 2020. Effective on January 1, 2023, the CPRA imposes additional obligations on companies covered by the legislation and will significantly modify the CCPA, including by expanding consumers\u2019 rights with respect to certain sensitive personal\ninformation. The CPRA also creates a new state agency that will be vested with authority to implement and enforce the CCPA and the CPRA. The effects of the CCPA and the CPRA are potentially significant and may require us to modify our data collection or processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses in an effort to comply and increase our potential exposure to regulatory enforcement and/or litigation.\nCertain other state laws impose similar privacy obligations and we also anticipate that more states will increasingly enact legislation similar to the CCPA. The CCPA has prompted a number of proposals for new federal and state-level privacy legislation and in some states efforts to pass comprehensive privacy laws have been successful. For example, on March 2, 2021, Virginia enacted the Consumer Data Protection Act, or CDPA. The CDPA will become effective January 1, 2023. The CDPA will regulate how businesses (which the CDPA refers to as \u201ccontrollers\u201d) collect and share personal information. While the CDPA incorporates many similar concepts of the CCPA and CPRA, there are also several key differences in the scope, application, and enforcement of the law that will change the operational practices of controllers. The new law will impact how controllers collect and process personal sensitive data, conduct data protection assessments, transfer personal data to affiliates, and respond to consumer rights requests.\nAlso, on July 8, 2021, Colorado\u2019s governor signed the Colorado Privacy Act, or CPA, into law. The CPA is rather similar to Virginia\u2019s CDPA, but also contains additional requirements. The new measure applies to companies conducting business in Colorado or who produce or deliver commercial products or services intentionally targeted to residents of the state that either: (1) control or process the personal data of at least 100,000 consumers during a calendar year; or (2) derive revenue or receive a discount on the price of goods or services from the sale of personal data and process or control the personal data of at least 25,000 consumers.\nWith the CPA, Colorado became the third state to enact a comprehensive privacy law. A number of additional other states have proposed bills for comprehensive consumer privacy laws and it is quite possible that certain of these bills will pass. The existence of comprehensive privacy laws in different states in the country, if enacted, will add additional complexity, variation in requirements, restrictions and potential legal risk, require additional investment of resources in compliance programs, impact strategies and the availability of previously useful data, and has resulted in and will result in increased compliance costs and/or changes in business practices and policies.\nInternationally, virtually every jurisdiction in which we operate has established its own data security and privacy legal framework with which we or our customers must comply. In May 2018, the European General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, came into effect and established requirements applicable to the handling of personal data and may result in fines up to \u20ac20 million or up to 4% of annual global turnover in the preceding financial year, whichever is higher, and other administrative penalties. Compliance with GDPR has and will continue to require valuable management and employee time and resources. In many European jurisdictions enforcement actions and consequences for non-compliance are also rising.\nIn February 2016, the European Union and U.S. officials announced an agreement, which established the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework, or the Privacy Shield, as a means for legitimating the transfer of personal data from the European Economic Area to the U.S. We have in the past relied on various transfer safeguards, including the Privacy Shield, to legitimize data transfers from the EU to the U.S. However, in July 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union, or the CJEU, in Case C-311/18 (Data Protection Commissioner v Facebook Ireland and Maximillian Schrems or Schrems II) invalidated the Privacy Shield on the grounds that the Privacy Shield failed to offer adequate protections to EU personal data transferred to the U.S. The CJEU, in the same decision, deemed that the Standard Contractual Clauses, or SCCs, remain valid. However, the CJEU ruled that transfers made pursuant to the SCCs need to be assessed on a case-by-case basis taking into account the legal regime applicable in the destination country, and required businesses to assess whether supplementary measures that provide privacy protections additional to those provided under SCCs need to be implemented to ensure an essentially equivalent level of data protection to that afforded in the EU. Subsequent guidance published by the European Data Protection Board, or EDPB, in June 2021 described what such supplementary measures must be, and stated that businesses should avoid or cease transfers of personal data if, in the absence of supplementary measures, equivalent protections cannot be afforded. Additionally, the EDPB guidance clarified that the CJEU\u2019s requirements regarding the SCCs also apply to other transfer mechanisms, such as the Binding Corporate Rules, which serve as Zendesk\u2019s primary mechanism to legitimize data transfers from the EU to other jurisdictions, including the U.S. In June 2021, the European Commission published new versions of the SCCs, which seek to address items identified by the CJEU\u2019s Schrems II decision and provide further details regarding the transfer assessments that the parties are required to conduct when implementing the new SCCs. The new SCCs must be used for relevant new data transfers from September 27, 2021; existing SCCs arrangements must be migrated to the new SCCs by December 27, 2022. Similarly, the Swiss data protection authority determined the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield framework was no longer a valid mechanism for Swiss-U.S. data transfers.\nOutside of the EU, on August 27, 2021, the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) announced that the new EU SCCs could be relied upon to legitimize transfers of personal data out of Switzerland to third countries that have not been deemed to provide \u201cadequate\u201d protection to personal data. The new EU SCCs must be used for any new contract entered into as of September 27, 2021 and implemented in existing contracts that incorporate the prior version of\nthe SCCs by January 1, 2023. In the UK, following Brexit, the UK is no longer subject to the EC\u2019s new standard contractual clauses but has published a draft version of a UK-specific transfer mechanism, which, once finalized, will enable transfers from the UK. We will be required to implement these new safeguards when conducting restricted data transfers and doing so will require significant effort and cost. These and other future developments regarding the flow of data across borders could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services in some markets and may lead to governmental enforcement actions, litigation, fines, and penalties or adverse publicity, which could adversely affect our business and financial position.\nJurisdictions outside of Europe are also considering and/or enacting comprehensive data protection legislation. For example, as of August 2020, the Brazilian General Data Protection Law imposes requirements similar to GDPR on products and services offered to users in Brazil. Cross-border data transfers and other future developments regarding local data residency could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services in some markets and may lead to governmental enforcement actions, litigation, fines, and penalties or adverse publicity, which could adversely affect our business and financial position, could greatly increase our cost of providing our products and services, require significant changes to our operations, or even prevent us from offering certain services in specific jurisdictions.\nIn addition to government regulation, privacy advocates and industry groups may propose new and different self-regulatory standards that either legally or contractually apply to us. Further, our customers or potential customers may require us to comply with more stringent privacy and data security contractual requirements or decide not to do business with us. For example, some of our customers or potential customers who do business in the European Union may require us to host all personal data within the European Union and may decide to do business with one of our competitors who hosts personal data within the European Union instead of doing business with us. Particularly in this regulatory environment, if we or other SaaS providers experience data security incidents, loss of customer data, disruptions in delivery, or other problems, the market for SaaS business applications, including our solutions, may be negatively affected.\nWe also continue to see jurisdictions imposing data localization laws, which may require personal information of citizens of a jurisdiction to be, among other data processing operations, initially collected, stored, and modified locally within such jurisdiction. These regulations may deter customers from using services such as ours, and may inhibit our ability to expand into those markets or prohibit us from continuing to offer services in those markets without significant additional costs.\nBecause the interpretation and application of many privacy and data protection laws, commercial frameworks, and standards are uncertain, it is possible that these laws, frameworks, and standards may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our existing data management practices or the features of our solutions. If so, in addition to the possibility of fines, lawsuits, breach of contract claims, and other claims and penalties, we could be required to fundamentally change our business activities and practices or modify our solutions, which could have an adverse effect on our business. Any inability to adequately address privacy and security concerns, even if unfounded, or comply with applicable privacy and security or data security laws, regulations, and policies, could result in additional cost and liability to us, damage our reputation, inhibit sales, and adversely affect our business.\nFurthermore, the costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, the laws, regulations, and policies that are applicable to the businesses of our customers may limit the use and adoption of, and reduce the overall demand for, our solutions. Privacy and data security concerns, whether valid or not valid, may inhibit market adoption of our solutions, particularly in certain industries and foreign countries.\nReal or perceived errors, failures, or bugs in our solutions could adversely affect our operating results and growth prospects.\nBecause our solutions are complex, undetected errors, failures, vulnerabilities, or bugs may occur, especially when updates are deployed. Our solutions are often used in connection with large-scale computing environments with different operating systems, system management software, equipment, and networking configurations, which may cause errors or failures of our solutions or other aspects of the computing environment into which they are deployed. In addition, deployment of our solutions into complicated, large-scale computing environments may expose undetected errors, failures, vulnerabilities, or bugs in our solutions. We have discovered, and expect to continue to discover, software errors, failures, vulnerabilities, and bugs in our solutions, some of which have been or may only be discovered and remediated after deployment to customers. Real or perceived errors, failures, vulnerabilities, or bugs in our solutions could result in negative publicity, loss of or delay in market acceptance of our solutions, loss of competitive position, or claims by customers for losses sustained by them. In such an event, we may be required, or may choose, for customer relations or other reasons, to expend additional resources in order to help correct the problem.\nIncorrect or improper implementation or use of our product and platform solutions could result in customer dissatisfaction and negatively affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and growth prospects.\nOur product and platform solutions are deployed in a wide variety of technology environments and into a broad range of complex workflows. Increasingly, our solutions have been, and will continue to be, integrated into large-scale, complex\ntechnology environments and specialized use cases, and we believe our future success will depend on our ability to increase use of our solutions in such deployments. We often assist our customers in implementing our solutions, but many customers attempt to implement deployments, including complex deployments, themselves. If we or our customers are unable to implement our solutions successfully, or are unable to do so in a timely manner, customer perceptions of our solutions and of our company may be impaired, our reputation and brand may suffer, and customers may choose not to renew or expand the use of our solutions.\nOur customers and third-party partners may need training in the proper use of our solutions to maximize their potential. If our solutions are not implemented or used correctly or as intended, inadequate performance may result. Because our customers rely on our solutions to manage a wide range of operations and to drive a number of their internal processes, the incorrect or improper implementation or use of our solutions, our failure to train customers on how to efficiently and effectively use our solutions, or our failure to provide adequate product support to our customers, may result in negative publicity or legal claims against us. Also, as we continue to expand our customer base, any failure by us to properly provide these services will likely result in lost opportunities for additional subscriptions to our solutions.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property Matters\nIndemnity provisions in various agreements potentially expose us to substantial liability for intellectual property infringement and other losses.\nOur agreements with customers and other third parties may include indemnification or other provisions under which we agree to indemnify or otherwise be liable to them for losses suffered or incurred as a result of claims of intellectual property infringement, damages caused by us to property or persons, or other liabilities relating to or arising from our solutions or other acts or omissions. The term of these contractual provisions often survives termination or expiration of the applicable agreement. Large indemnity payments or damage claims from contractual breach could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. From time to time, customers require us to indemnify or otherwise be liable to them for breach of confidentiality or failure to implement adequate security measures with respect to their data stored, transmitted, or processed by our product and platform solutions. Although we normally contractually limit our liability with respect to such obligations, we may still incur substantial liability related to them. Any dispute with a customer with respect to such obligations could have adverse effects on our relationship with that customer and other current and prospective customers, reduce demand for our solutions, and harm our business and operating results.\nOur use of \u201copen source\u201d software could negatively affect our ability to sell our solutions and subject us to possible litigation.\nWe use open source software in our solutions and expect to continue to use open source software in the future. We may face claims from others claiming ownership of, or seeking to enforce the terms of, an open source license, including by demanding release of the open source software, derivative works, or our proprietary source code that was developed using such software. These claims could also result in litigation, require us to purchase a costly license, or require us to devote additional research and development resources to change our solutions, any of which would have a negative effect on our business and operating results. In addition, if the license terms for the open source software we utilize change, we may be forced to reengineer our solutions or incur additional costs. Although we have implemented policies to regulate the use and incorporation of open source software into our solutions, we cannot be certain that we have not incorporated open source software in our solutions in a manner that is inconsistent with such policies.\nAny failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand.\nOur success and ability to compete depend in part upon our intellectual property. We currently have fourteen issued patents and have a limited number of pending patent applications, none of which may result in an issued patent. We rely on copyright, trade secret, and trademark laws, patents, and confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, customers, partners, and others to protect our intellectual property rights. However, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property rights may be inadequate.\nIn order to protect our intellectual property rights, we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect these rights. Litigation brought to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly, time-consuming, and distracting to management, and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property. Furthermore, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims, and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. Our failure to secure, protect, and enforce our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our brand and adversely impact our business.\nWe have been, and may in the future be, sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights.\nThere is considerable patent and other intellectual property development activity in our industry. Our future success depends in part on not infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others. From time to time, our competitors or other third parties have claimed, and may in the future claim, that we, our solutions or our underlying technology are infringing upon or otherwise violating their intellectual property rights, and we may be found to be infringing or violating upon such rights. We may be unaware of the intellectual property rights of others that may cover some or all of our technology. Any claims or litigation could cause us to incur significant expenses and, if successfully asserted against us, could require that we pay substantial damages or ongoing royalty payments, prevent us from offering one or more of our solutions, or require that we comply with other unfavorable terms. We may also be obligated to indemnify our customers or business partners in connection with any such litigation and to obtain licenses, modify our solutions, or refund subscription fees, which could further exhaust our resources. In addition, we may incur substantial costs to resolve claims or litigation, whether or not successfully asserted against us, which could include payment of significant settlement, royalty, or license fees, modification of our solutions, or refunds to customers of subscription fees. Even if we were to prevail in the event of claims or litigation against us, any claim or litigation regarding our intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming and divert the attention of our management and other employees from our business operations. Such disputes could also disrupt our solutions, adversely impacting our customer satisfaction and ability to attract customers.\nRisks Related to Tax and Accounting Matters\nTaxing authorities may successfully assert that we should have collected, or in the future should collect, sales and use, value added, or similar taxes, and we could be subject to liability with respect to past or future sales, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe do not collect sales and use, value added, or similar taxes in all jurisdictions in which we have sales, based on our understanding that such taxes are not applicable. Sales and use, value added, and similar tax laws and rates vary greatly by jurisdiction. Certain jurisdictions in which we do not collect such taxes may assert that such taxes are applicable, which could result in tax assessments, penalties, and interest, and we may be required to collect such taxes in the future. Such tax assessments, penalties, and interest, or future requirements, may adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur international operations subject us to potentially adverse tax consequences.\nWe were founded in Denmark in 2007 and were headquartered in Denmark until we reincorporated in Delaware in 2009. Today, we generally conduct our international operations through subsidiaries and report our taxable income in various jurisdictions worldwide based upon our business operations in those jurisdictions. Our intercompany relationships and transactions are subject to complex regulations, including but not limited to transfer pricing regulations administered by taxing authorities in various jurisdictions. Our tax returns are generally subject to audit and/or further examination by taxing authorities and the relevant taxing authorities have and will disagree with our transfer pricing practices and procedures, including our determinations as to the value of assets sold or acquired or income and expenses attributable to specific jurisdictions or transactions. If our position were not sustained, we could be required to pay additional taxes, interest, and penalties, which could result in one-time tax charges, higher effective tax rates, reduced cash flows, and lower overall profitability of our operations.\nAdditionally, tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied. The United States continuously enacts tax legislation, including regulations related to the significant tax reform legislation enacted in 2017, and certain tax provisions may potentially adversely affect us in the future. For example, U.S. President Joseph Biden\u2019s plan to increase the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate could materially increase the amount of taxes we owe, thereby negatively impacting our results of operations as well as our cash flows from operations. In addition, governmental tax authorities are increasingly scrutinizing the tax positions of companies. Many countries in the European Union, as well as a number of other countries and organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, are actively considering changes to existing tax laws that, if enacted, could increase our tax obligations in\ncountries where we do business. If U.S. or other foreign tax authorities change applicable tax laws, our overall taxes could increase, and our business, financial condition, or results of operations may be adversely impacted.\nIf our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.\nWe review our intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually. As of December 31, 2021, we had a net balance of $197 million of goodwill and intangible assets related to business acquisitions. An adverse change in market conditions, particularly a change resulting in a significant decrease in our share price, or if such change has the effect of changing one of our critical assumptions or estimates, could result in a change to the estimation of fair value that could result in an impairment charge to our goodwill or intangible assets. Any such charges may have a material negative impact on our operating results.\nOur ability to use our net operating losses to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, of $1,601 million and $665 million, respectively, due to prior period losses. In general, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d (generally defined as a greater than 50-percentage-point cumulative change (by value) in the equity ownership of certain stockholders over a rolling three-year period) is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its NOLs to offset future taxable income. Our existing NOLs may be subject to limitations arising from previous ownership changes, including in connection with our initial public offering or our follow-on public offering. Future changes in our stock ownership, some of which are outside of our control, could result in an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code. Furthermore, our ability to utilize NOLs of companies that we may acquire in the future may be subject to limitations. Our NOLs generated before fiscal year 2018 are subject to a 20-year carryover limitation and may expire if unused within that period. There is also a risk that due to legislative changes, such as suspensions on the use of NOLs, or other unforeseen reasons, our existing NOLs could expire or otherwise be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities. Our NOLs may also be subject to limitations under state law. For example, California recently enacted legislation suspending the use of NOLs for taxable years 2020, 2021 and 2022 for many taxpayers. In addition, under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, as modified by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, the amount of NOLs that we are permitted to deduct in any taxable year is limited to 80% of our taxable income in such year, where taxable income is determined without regard to the NOL deduction itself. For these reasons, we may not be able to realize a tax benefit from the use of our NOLs, whether or not we attain profitability.\nOur reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, in the United States are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, the SEC and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change. For example, on January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, 606, \u201cRevenue from Contracts with Customers,\u201d which changed our accounting policies regarding revenue recognition and incremental costs to acquire customer contracts. We also adjusted our consolidated financial statements from amounts previously reported to reflect the adoption. Certain other standards that become effective in the future may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. See Note 2 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding the effect of new accounting pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements. Any difficulties in implementing these standards could cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations, which could result in regulatory discipline and harm investors\u2019 confidence in us.\nWe depend and rely upon SaaS technologies from third parties to operate our business and interruptions or performance problems with these technologies may adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe rely heavily on hosted SaaS applications from third parties in order to operate critical functions of our business, including billing and order management, enterprise resource planning, and financial accounting processes. If these services become unavailable due to extended outages or interruptions, or because they are no longer available on commercially reasonable terms, our expenses could increase, our ability to manage finances could be interrupted, and our processes for managing sales of our solutions and supporting our customers could be impaired until equivalent services, if available, are identified, obtained, and implemented, all of which could adversely affect our business.\nWe face exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nAs our international operations expand, our exposure to the effects of fluctuations in currency exchange rates grows. While we have primarily transacted with customers in U.S. dollars historically, we expect to continue to expand the number of transactions with our customers that are denominated in foreign currencies in the future. Fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may make our subscriptions more expensive for international customers, which could harm our business. Additionally, we incur expenses for employee compensation and other operating expenses at our non-U.S. locations in the local currency for such locations. Fluctuations in the exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies could result in an increase to the U.S. dollar equivalent of such expenses. These fluctuations could cause our results of operations to differ from our expectations or the expectations of our investors. Additionally, such foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations could make it more difficult to detect underlying trends in our business and results of operations.\nOur international subsidiaries maintain net assets that are denominated in currencies other than the functional operating currencies of these entities. Accordingly, changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar can affect our operating results due to transactional and translational remeasurements that are reflected in our results of operations. To the extent that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates cause our results of operations to differ from our expectations or the expectations of our investors, the trading price of our common stock could be adversely affected.\nWe currently operate a hedging program to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our cash flows and earnings. The use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place. Moreover, the use of hedging instruments may introduce additional risks if we are unable to structure effective hedges with such instruments, which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nRisks Related to Macroeconomic Conditions\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has and may continue to cause harm to our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus and resulting COVID-19 disease a global pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused adverse public health developments, including orders to shelter-in-place, travel restrictions, and mandated business closures, which have adversely affected workforces, organizations, customers, economies, and financial markets globally. In light of the uncertain and rapidly evolving situation relating to the spread of COVID-19, we have taken precautionary measures, including imposing travel restrictions for our employees, mandating a global work from home policy, and shifting customer events to virtual-only experiences. Operationally, we have increased our focus on being prudent in managing operating expenses. Although we continue to monitor the situation and may adjust our current policies as more information and public health guidance become available, precautionary measures that have been adopted could negatively affect our customer success efforts, customer retention, sales and marketing efforts, delay and lengthen our sales cycles, affect our revenue growth rate, or create operational or other challenges, any of which could harm our business and results of operations. Additionally, our customers and potential customers may and have been exposed to similar operational considerations, resulting in significant pressures on their expenditures, and subsequently resulting in a decreased demand for our solutions.\nIn addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has and may continue to disrupt the operations of our customers and partners for an indefinite period of time, including as a result of travel restrictions and/or business shutdowns, all of which could negatively impact our business and results of operations, including cash flows. More generally, the COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected economies and financial markets globally, potentially leading to prolonged and disproportionate impacts to certain industries, which could decrease technology spending and adversely affect demand for our offerings and harm our business and results of operations. Further, as companies adapt to the changing economic environment, they may have purchasing behavior which does not match historical trends, negatively impacting our ability to forecast our results.\nIt is not possible for us to estimate the duration or magnitude of the adverse results of the outbreak and its effects on our business, results of operations, or financial condition at this time as the impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nUnfavorable conditions in our industry or the global economy or reductions in information technology spending could limit our ability to grow our business and negatively affect our operating results.\nOur operating results may vary based on the impact of changes in our industry or the global economy on us or our customers. The revenue growth and potential profitability of our business depend on demand for business software applications and services generally and for customer service systems in particular. In addition, our revenue is dependent on the number of users of our solutions, which in turn is influenced by the employment and hiring patterns of our customers. To the extent that weak economic conditions cause our customers and prospective customers to freeze or reduce their hiring for personnel providing service and support, demand for our solutions may be negatively affected. Historically, during economic downturns there have been reductions in spending on information technology and customer service systems as well as pressure for extended billing terms and other financial concessions. If global economic conditions deteriorate, our customers and prospective customers may elect to decrease their information technology and customer service budgets, which would limit our ability to grow our business and negatively affect our operating results.\nCatastrophic events may disrupt, and have disrupted, our business.\nOur corporate headquarters are located in San Francisco, California and we operate in or utilize hosting resources that are located in North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia. Key features and functionality of our solutions are enabled by third parties that are headquartered in California and operate in or utilize data centers in the United States and Europe. Additionally, we rely on our network and third-party infrastructure and enterprise applications, internal technology systems, and our website for our development, marketing, operational support, hosted services, and sales activities. In the event of a major earthquake, hurricane, or catastrophic event such as fire, pandemic, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, cyber-attack, war, or terrorist attack, we may be unable to continue our operations and may endure system interruptions, reputational harm, delays in our application development, lengthy interruptions in our solutions, breaches of data security, disruption to our customer success efforts, and loss of critical data, all of which could have an adverse effect on our future operating results.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur stock price has been, and may continue to be, volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance, resulting in substantial losses for our stockholders.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile and could fluctuate widely regardless of our operating performance. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022the financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections, or our failure to meet these projections;\n\u2022failure of securities analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of our company, changes in financial estimates, and publication of other news by any securities analysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\n\u2022ratings changes by any securities analysts who follow our company;\n\u2022announcements by us or our competitors of significant technical innovations, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments;\n\u2022changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those in our industry in particular;\n\u2022price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time, including as a result of trends in the economy as a whole;\n\u2022the short and long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including on the global economy, our results of operations, software spending and business continuity;\n\u2022changes in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations, or principles;\n\u2022actual or anticipated developments in our business or our competitors\u2019 businesses or the competitive landscape generally;\n\u2022developments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or our solutions, or third-party proprietary rights;\n\u2022announced or completed acquisitions of businesses or technologies by us or our competitors;\n\u2022new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;\n\u2022any major change in our board of directors or management;\n\u2022sales of shares of our common stock by us or our stockholders;\n\u2022lawsuits threatened or filed against us; and\n\u2022other events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, public health crises or responses to these events.\nIn addition, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies. Stock prices of many technology companies have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. In the past, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. If we were to become involved in securities litigation in the future or if we are unsuccessful in defending securities-related litigation currently filed against us, it could subject us to substantial costs, make it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, divert resources and the attention of management from operating our business, and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nOur directors, officers, and principal stockholders beneficially own a significant percentage of our stock and will be able to exert significant influence over matters subject to stockholder approval.\nBased on public filings available as of the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as of December 31, 2021, our directors, officers, five percent or greater stockholders, and their respective affiliates beneficially owned in the aggregate approximately 30% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, these stockholders have the ability to influence us through this ownership position. These stockholders may be able to exert significant influence in matters requiring stockholder approval. For example, these stockholders may be able to exert significant influence in elections of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, and approval of any merger, sale of assets, or other major corporate transaction. This may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock that you may feel are in your best interest as one of our stockholders.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of our company more difficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management, and limit the market price of our common stock.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws include provisions that:\n\u2022authorize our board of directors to issue, without further action by our stockholders, shares of undesignated preferred stock with terms, rights, and preferences determined by our board of directors that may be senior to our common stock;\n\u2022require that any action to be taken by our stockholders be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting and not by written consent;\n\u2022specify that special meetings of our stockholders can be called only by our board of directors, the Chair of our board of directors, or our Chief Executive Officer;\n\u2022establish an advance notice procedure for stockholder proposals to be brought before an annual meeting, including proposed nominations of persons for election to our board of directors;\n\u2022establish that our board of directors is divided into three classes, Class I, Class II, and Class III, with each class serving three-year staggered terms;\n\u2022prohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n\u2022provide that our directors may be removed only for cause;\n\u2022provide that vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum; and\n\u2022require the approval of our board of directors or the holders of at least 75% of our outstanding shares of capital stock to amend our bylaws and certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (\u201cSection 203\u201d), which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any \u201cinterested\u201d stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an \u201cinterested\u201d stockholder. The provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws cited above and the applicability of Section 203 may tend to delay, defer or prevent a potential unsolicited offer or takeover attempt that is not approved by our board of directors but that our stockholders might consider to be in their best interest, including an attempt that might result in stockholders receiving a premium over the market price for their shares. Any delay or prevention of a change of control transaction or changes in our management could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nThe changing laws and regulations related to being a public company may strain our resources and divert management\u2019s attention.\nChanging laws, regulations, and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure can create uncertainty for public companies and increase legal and financial compliance costs. These laws, regulations, and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We intend to continue to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations, and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from business operations to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations, and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to their application and practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be adversely affected. Further, we may in the future hire lobbyists or engage in other permissible political activities with the intent of furthering our business interests or otherwise; such efforts may not be successful and would result in additional costs to the business.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock so any returns will be limited to changes in the value of our common stock.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation, and expansion of our business, and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. In addition, our ability to pay cash dividends on our common stock may be prohibited or limited by the terms of our future debt financing arrangements. Any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to the increase, if any, of our stock price, which may never occur.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not continue to publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our common stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our common stock could decrease, which might cause our common stock price and trading volume to decline.\nOur charter documents designate specific courts as the exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by the Company\u2019s stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for state law claims for (A) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; (B) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, or other employees to us or our stockholders; (C) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law or our certificate of incorporation or bylaws (including the interpretation, validity or enforceability thereof); or (D) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine (the \u201cDelaware Forum Provision\u201d). The Delaware Forum Provision will not apply to any causes of action arising under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act. Our bylaws further provide that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the district courts of the United States shall be the sole and exclusive forum for resolving any complaint\nasserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act (the \u201cFederal Forum Provision\u201d). In addition, our bylaws provide that any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock is deemed to have notice of and consented to the Delaware Forum Provision and the Federal Forum Provision; provided, however, that stockholders cannot and will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.\nThe Delaware Forum Provision and the Federal Forum Provision in our bylaws may impose additional litigation costs on stockholders in pursuing any such claims. Additionally, these forum selection clauses may limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that they find favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees, which may discourage the filing of lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and employees, even though an action, if successful, might benefit our stockholders. In addition, Section 22 of the Securities Act creates a concurrent jurisdiction for state and federal courts over all suits brought concerning a duty or liability created by the securities laws, rules and regulations thereunder. While the Delaware Supreme Court ruled in March 2020 that federal forum selection provisions purporting to require claims under the Securities Act be brought in federal court are \u201cfacially valid\u201d under Delaware law, there is uncertainty as to whether other courts will enforce our Federal Forum Provision. If the Federal Forum Provision is found to be unenforceable, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters. The Federal Forum Provision may also impose additional litigation costs on stockholders who assert that the provision is not enforceable or invalid. The Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the federal district courts of the United States may also reach different judgments or results than would other courts, including courts where a stockholder considering an action may be located or would otherwise choose to bring the action, and such judgments may be more or less favorable to us than our stockholders.\nRisks Related to our Outstanding Convertible Notes\nServicing our debt may require a significant amount of cash. We may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our indebtedness, and we may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle cash conversions of the Notes or to repurchase the Notes for cash upon a fundamental change, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIn March 2018, we issued $575 million in aggregate principal amount of 0.25% convertible senior notes due 2023 (the \u201c2023 Notes\u201d), in a private offering. The interest rate on the 2023 Notes is fixed at 0.25% per annum and is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year. In June 2020, we issued $1,150 million aggregate principal amount of 0.625% convertible senior notes due 2025 in a private offering (the \u201c2025 Notes,\u201d and together with the 2023 Notes, the \u201cNotes\u201d). The interest rate on the 2025 Notes is fixed at 0.625% per annum and is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, commencing on December 15, 2020. In connection with the offering of the 2025 Notes, the Company used $618 million of the net proceeds from the offering of the 2025 Notes to repurchase $426 million aggregate principal amount of the 2023 Notes in cash through individual privately negotiated transactions (the \u201c2023 Notes Partial Repurchase\u201d). As of the repurchase date, the carrying value of the 2023 Notes subject to the 2023 Notes Partial Repurchase, net of unamortized debt discount and issuance costs, was $367 million. The 2023 Notes Partial Repurchase resulted in a $26 million loss on early debt extinguishment. As of December 31, 2021, $149 million of principal remains outstanding on the 2023 Notes. Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness, including the Notes, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate cash flows from operations in the future that are sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flows, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional debt financing or equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance any future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations.\nHolders of the Notes have the right to require us to repurchase their Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture governing the Notes) at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. Upon conversion, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the Notes being converted. We may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases in connection with such conversion and our ability to pay may additionally be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our future indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase the Notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the indenture governing the Notes or to pay any cash payable on future conversions as required by such indenture would constitute a default under such indenture. A default under the indenture or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our future indebtedness. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the\nindebtedness and repurchase the Notes or make cash payments upon conversions thereof. Additionally, subject to certain exceptions, if we fail to timely file any document or report required under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, in certain circumstances we may be required to pay additional interest of up to 0.50% per annum on our Notes in order to avoid an event of default under the indenture, which may affect our ability to repay the Notes. Furthermore, if we do not remedy such failure within 360 days after receiving notice thereof from the noteholders, there would be an event of default under the indenture.\nThe conditional conversion feature of the Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nIn the event the conditional conversion feature of the Notes is triggered, holders of Notes will be entitled to convert the Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their Notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. As disclosed in Note 9 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the conditional conversion feature of the 2023 Notes that is based on the closing stock price of our common stock during the last 30 trading days of a calendar quarter was triggered as of December 31, 2021, and the 2023 Notes are convertible at the option of the holders, in whole or in part, between January 1, 2022 and March 31, 2022. Whether the 2023 Notes will be convertible following such calendar quarter will depend on the satisfaction of this conditional conversion feature or another conversion condition in the future. The 2025 Notes are not currently convertible.\nIn addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their Notes at a time when they are convertible, we are required to reclassify the outstanding principal of the Notes that are convertible as a current rather than long-term liability, resulting in a material reduction of our net working capital. We have classified the 2023 Notes as a current liability on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021.\nTransactions relating to our Notes may affect the value of our common stock.\nThe conversion of some or all of the Notes would dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders to the extent we satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering shares of our common stock upon any conversion of such Notes. Our Notes may become in the future convertible at the option of their holders under certain circumstances. If holders of our Notes elect to convert their Notes, we may settle our conversion obligation by delivering to them a significant number of shares of our common stock, which would cause dilution to our existing stockholders.\nIn addition, in connection with the issuance of the Notes, we entered into capped call transactions with certain financial institutions, or the Option Counterparties. The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock upon any conversion or settlement of the Notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap. From time to time, the Option Counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the Notes. This activity could cause a decrease in the market price of our common stock.\nWe are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the capped call transactions.\nThe Option Counterparties are financial institutions, and we are subject to the risk that any or all of them may default under the capped call transactions. Our exposure to the credit risk of the Option Counterparties will not be secured by collateral. Global economic conditions have resulted in actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of many institutions. If an Option Counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings, with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under our transactions with the Option Counterparty. Our exposure will depend on many factors, but generally, an increase in our exposure will be correlated to an increase in the market price and in the volatility of our common stock. In addition, upon default by an Option Counterparty, we may suffer adverse tax consequences and more dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to our common stock. We can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of the Option Counterparties.\nThe accounting method for convertible debt securities, such as the Notes, could have a material effect on our reported financial results.\nUnder FASB ASC 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options, or ASC 470-20, an entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments (such as the Notes) that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer\u2019s economic interest cost. ASC 470-20 requires the value of\nthe conversion option of the Notes, representing the equity component, to be recorded as additional paid-in capital within stockholders\u2019 equity in our consolidated balance sheet and as a discount to the Notes, which reduces their initial carrying value. The carrying value of the Notes, net of the discount recorded, is accreted up to the principal amount of the Notes from the issuance date until maturity, which results in non-cash charges to interest expense in our consolidated statement of operations. Accordingly, we have reported lower net income or higher net loss in our financial results because ASC 470-20 requires interest to include both the current period\u2019s accretion of the debt discount and the instrument\u2019s coupon interest, which could adversely affect our reported or future financial results, the trading price of our common stock and the trading price of the Notes.\nIn addition, under certain circumstances, convertible debt instruments (such as the Notes) that may be settled entirely or partly in cash are currently accounted for utilizing the treasury stock method, the effect of which is that the shares issuable upon conversion of the Notes are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share except to the extent that the conversion value of the Notes exceeds their principal amount. Under the treasury stock method, for diluted earnings per share purposes, the transaction is accounted for as if the number of shares of common stock that would be necessary to settle such excess, if we elected to settle such excess in shares, are issued.\nIn August 2020, the FASB published an Accounting Standard Update that, for most convertible instruments (such as the Notes), requires the entire debt amount to be classified as a liability. This would eliminate the recognition of non-cash charges to interest expense, and accordingly, would result in higher net income or lower net loss in our financial statements. Additionally, the new guidance eliminates the treasury stock method for most convertible instruments and instead requires application of the \u201cif-converted\u201d method. Under that method, diluted earnings per share would generally be calculated assuming that all the Notes were converted solely into shares of common stock at the beginning of the reporting period, unless the result would be antidilutive. Upon adoption of the standard, which we will adopt in fiscal year 2022, we will be unable to use the treasury stock method in accounting for the shares issuable upon conversion of the Notes. Accordingly, our diluted earnings per share is expected to be adversely affected in periods when we report net income after adoption of the standard.\nRisks Related to the Proposed Acquisition of Momentive\nWe may not complete the proposed acquisition of Momentive within the time frame we anticipate or at all.\nOn October 28, 2021, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \u201cMerger Agreement\u201d), by and among the Company, Milky Way Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (\u201cMerger Sub\u201d), and Momentive Global Inc., a Delaware corporation (\u201cMomentive\u201d), whereby Merger Sub will be merged with and into Momentive (the \u201cMerger\u201d), with Momentive continuing as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.\nThe completion of the Merger is subject to a number of conditions, including approval of the Company\u2019s stockholders, approval of Momentive\u2019s stockholders, and customary closing conditions. The failure to satisfy all of the required conditions could delay the completion of the Merger for a significant period of time or prevent it from occurring at all. A delay in completing the Merger could prevent us from realizing some or all of the expected benefits of the Merger within the time frame currently anticipated or at all, which could result in additional transaction costs or in other negative effects associated with uncertainty about the completion of the Merger.\nFurthermore, either the Company or Momentive may terminate the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances, including, among others, if the Merger is not completed by July 28, 2022. If the Merger is not completed, we would not realize any of the anticipated benefits of the Merger, and we may suffer other consequences that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and stock price, including the payment of a termination fee of $150 million under specified circumstances, transaction costs that are payable by us whether or not the Merger is completed, and possible legal proceedings related to the Merger or the failure to complete the Merger.\nWe may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the proposed acquisition of Momentive or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected.\nWe believe that there are significant benefits and synergies that may be realized through leveraging the products, platforms, scale and combined customer bases of the Company and Momentive. However, the efforts to realize these benefits and synergies will be a complex process and may disrupt both companies\u2019 existing operations if not implemented in a timely and efficient manner. The full benefits of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the anticipated sales or growth opportunities, may not be realized as expected or may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all. Failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of the Merger could adversely affect our results of operations or cash flows, cause dilution to our earnings per share, decrease or delay any accretive effect of the Merger and negatively impact the price of our common stock.\nFollowing completion of the Merger, our success will depend, in part, on our ability to manage our expansion, which poses numerous risks and uncertainties, including the need to integrate the operations and business of Momentive into our existing business in an efficient and timely manner, to combine systems and management controls and to integrate relationships with industry contacts and business partners.\nIn addition, we and Momentive will be required to devote significant attention and resources prior to closing to prepare for the post-closing integration and operation of the combined company, and we will be required post-closing to devote significant attention and resources to successfully align our business practices and operations with those of Momentive. This process may disrupt the businesses and, if ineffective, would limit the anticipated benefits of the Merger.\nUncertainty about the proposed acquisition of Momentive may adversely affect relationships with our customers, partners, suppliers, and employees, whether or not the Merger is completed.\nIn response to the announcement of our proposed acquisition of Momentive, our existing or prospective customers, partners, or suppliers may:\n\u2022delay, defer, or cease purchasing products or services from, or providing products or services to, us or the combined company;\n\u2022delay or defer other decisions concerning us or the combined company; or\n\u2022otherwise seek to change the terms on which they do business with us or the combined company.\nAny such delays or changes to terms could materially harm our business or, if the Merger is completed, the business of the combined company.\nIn addition, as a result of the announcement of our proposed acquisition of Momentive, our current and prospective employees could experience uncertainty about their future with us or the combined company. As a result, key employees may depart because of issues relating to such uncertainty or a desire not to remain with the Company following the completion of the Merger.\nLosses of customers, partners, employees, or other important strategic relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Such adverse effects could also be exacerbated by a delay in the completion of the Merger for any reason, including delays associated with obtaining the approval of our and Momentive\u2019s stockholders.\nOur existing stockholders will experience dilution if the Merger is completed.\nThe Merger, if completed, will dilute the ownership position of our existing stockholders. Upon completion of the Merger, our existing stockholders are expected to own approximately 78% of our outstanding shares of common stock and former Momentive stockholders are expected to own approximately 22% of our outstanding shares of common stock. Consequently, our existing stockholders may have less influence over our management and policies if the Merger is completed than they currently have over our management and policies.\nStockholder litigation could negatively affect our business and operations.\nTransactions such as the Merger are frequently subject to litigation or other legal proceedings. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, nine complaints have been filed by purported stockholders of the Company and purported stockholders of Momentive, each of which seeks to enjoin the Merger and other relief. The complaints assert claims against certain defendants under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder for allegedly false and misleading statements in the joint proxy statement/prospectus and against certain defendants under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act for alleged \u201ccontrol person\u201d liability with respect to such allegedly false and misleading statements. The Company and Momentive intend to defend against the lawsuits filed, but might not be successful in doing so. An adverse outcome in such matters, as well as the costs and efforts of a defense even if successful, could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operation or financial position, including through the possible diversion of the Company\u2019s resources or distraction of key personnel.\nFurthermore, one of the conditions to the completion of the Merger is that no injunction by any governmental body of competent jurisdiction will be in effect that prevents the consummation of the Merger. As such, if any of the plaintiffs are successful in obtaining an injunction preventing the consummation of the Merger, that injunction may prevent the Merger from becoming effective or from becoming effective within the expected time frame.\nActions of activist shareholders or unsolicited bidders could impair our ability to consummate the Merger or otherwise negatively affect our business.\nWe value constructive input from investors and regularly engage in dialogue with our shareholders regarding strategy and performance. Our board of directors and management team are committed to acting in the best interests of all of our shareholders. There is no assurance that the actions taken by our board of directors and management in seeking to maintain constructive engagement with certain shareholders will be successful.\nRecently, an activist shareholder holding shares of the Company\u2019s stock has publicly opposed the Merger. The actions of this or other shareholder activists may make it more difficult to obtain approvals from the Company\u2019s and Momentive\u2019s respective stockholders for the Merger.\nResponding to actions by activist shareholders and third parties making unsolicited bids to acquire the Company or a portion of its business may be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations and divert the attention of management, our board of directors and our employees. A proxy contest or other activist campaign and related actions could also require us to incur substantial legal, public relations and other advisor fees and proxy solicitation expenses.\nAdditionally, perceived uncertainties as to our future strategy, performance, operations or governance as a result of shareholder activism, changes to the composition of our board of directors, or an unsolicited bid for the Company or a portion of its business may lead to the perception of a change in the direction of our business or other instability, which may be exploited by our competitors and/or other activist shareholders or other unsolicited bidders and cause concern to our current or potential customers, employees, investors, strategic partners and other constituencies. This could result in lost sales and the loss of business opportunities, including the anticipated benefits of the Merger, and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners. If customers choose to delay, defer or reduce transactions with us or do business with our competitors instead of us, then our business, financial condition and operating results would be adversely affected. In addition, our share price could experience periods of increased volatility as a result of shareholder activism.", "PERMNO": 14641, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "ZEN"}
