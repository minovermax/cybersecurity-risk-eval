Risk Factors\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND RISK FACTORS.\nWe caution that any forward-looking statements (as such term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or made by us, our management or our spokespeople involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various factors, many of which may be beyond our control. Words such as \u201cestimate,\u201d \u201cproject,\u201d \u201cplan,\u201d \u201cbelieve,\u201d \u201cexpect,\u201d \u201canticipate,\u201d \u201cintend\u201d and similar expressions may identify forward-looking statements. Except as may be required by applicable law, we assume no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict.\nThe current outbreak of COVID-19 has caused business disruption beginning in January 2020. In March 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak was declared to be a global pandemic by the World Health Organization. Further, the Company has seen, and expects to continue to see a direct, material adverse impact to sales and operations as a result of COVID-19. The rapidly evolving COVID-19 situation also poses various risks to the Company, certain of which are detailed throughout this Item 1A. Risk Factors. Any one of these risks, or a combination of risks could result in further adverse impacts on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, the following factors, categorized by the primary nature of the associated risk, could affect our financial performance and cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any of the forward-looking statements.\nMacroeconomic and industry risks include:\n\u2022\nChanges in global economic and financial conditions, and the resulting impact on consumer confidence and consumer spending, as well as other changes in consumer discretionary spending habits could have a material adverse impact on our business;\n\u2022\nFailure to engage our customers, anticipate customer demand and changing fashion trends, and manage our inventory commensurately could have a material adverse impact on our business;\n\u2022\nOur failure to operate in a highly competitive and constantly evolving industry could have a material adverse impact on our business;\n\u2022\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse impact on our business;\n\u2022\nOur ability to attract customers to our stores depends, in part, on the success of the shopping malls or area attractions that our stores are located in or around;\n\u2022\nThe impact of war, acts of terrorism, mass casualty events or civil unrest could have a material adverse impact on our business; and\n\u2022\nThe impact of extreme weather, infectious disease outbreaks, including COVID-19, and other unexpected events could result in an interruption to our business, as well as to the operations of our third-party partners, and have a material adverse impact on our business.\nStrategic risks include:\n\u2022\nFailure to successfully develop an omnichannel shopping experience, a significant component of our growth strategy, or failure to successfully invest in customer, digital and omnichannel initiatives could have a material adverse impact on our business;\n\u2022\nOur failure to optimize our global store network could have a material adverse impact on our business; and\n\u2022\nOur failure to execute our international growth strategy successfully and inability to conduct business in international markets as a result of legal, tax, regulatory, political and economic risks could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nOperational risks include:\n\u2022\nFailure to protect our reputation could have a material adverse impact on our business;\n\u2022\nIf our information technology systems are disrupted or cease to operate effectively it could have a material adverse impact on our business;\n\u2022\nWe may be exposed to risks and costs associated with cyber-attacks, data protection, credit card fraud and identity theft that could have a material adverse impact on our business;\n\u2022\nOur reliance on our distribution centers makes us susceptible to disruptions or adverse conditions affecting our supply chain;\n\u2022\nChanges in the cost, availability and quality of raw materials, labor, transportation, and trade relations could have a material adverse impact on our business;\n\u2022\nWe depend upon independent third parties for the manufacture and delivery of all our merchandise, and a disruption of the manufacture or delivery of our merchandise could have a material adverse impact on our business; and\n\u2022\nWe rely on the experience and skills of our executive officers and associates, and the failure to attract or retain this talent, or effectively manage succession could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nLegal, tax, regulatory and compliance risks include:\n\u2022\nFluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate may result in volatility in our results of operations could have a material adverse impact on our business;\n\u2022\nOur litigation exposure, or any securities litigation and shareholder activism, could have a material adverse impact on our business;\n\u2022\nFailure to adequately protect our trademarks could have a negative impact on our brand image and limit our ability to penetrate new markets which could have a material adverse impact on our business;\n\u2022\nChanges in the regulatory or compliance landscape could have a material adverse impact on our business; and\n\u2022\nOur credit facilities include restrictive covenants that limit our flexibility in operating our business and our inability to obtain credit on reasonable terms in the future could have an adverse impact on our business.\nThe factors listed above are not our only risks. Additional risks may arise, and current evaluations of risks may change, which could lead to material, adverse effects on our business, operating results and financial condition. The following sets forth a description of the preceding risk factors that we believe may be relevant to an understanding of our business. These risk factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any of our forward-looking statements.\nMACROECONOMIC AND INDUSTRY RISKS.\nChanges in global economic and financial conditions, and the resulting impact on consumer confidence and consumer spending, as well as other changes in consumer discretionary spending habits could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nOur business depends on consumer demand for our merchandise. Consumer preferences and discretionary spending habits, including purchases of our merchandise, can be adversely impacted by recessionary periods and other periods where disposable income is adversely affected. Our performance is subject to factors that affect worldwide economic conditions including unemployment, consumer credit availability, consumer debt levels, reductions in net worth based on declines in the financial, residential real estate and mortgage markets, sales and personal income tax rates, fuel and energy prices, interest rates, consumer confidence in future economic and political conditions, consumer perceptions of personal well-being and security, the value of the U.S. Dollar versus foreign currencies and other macroeconomic factors.\nGlobal uncertainty, such as the terms surrounding the United Kingdom\u2019s recent exit from the European Union, uncertainty with respect to trade policies and COVID-19, has in the past, and could in the future, cause changes in consumer confidence and in consumers\u2019 discretionary spending habits globally, resulting in a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity and capital resources.\nThe economic conditions and factors described above could adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity and capital resources, and may exacerbate other risks within this section of Item 1A \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d Changes in economic conditions could also impact our ability to fund growth and/or result in our becoming reliant on external financing, the availability and cost of which may be uncertain.\nFailure to engage our customers, anticipate customer demand and changing fashion trends, and manage our inventory commensurately could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nOur success largely depends on our ability to anticipate and gauge the fashion preferences of our customers and provide merchandise that satisfies constantly shifting demands in a timely manner. Because we may enter into agreements for the manufacture and purchase of merchandise well in advance of the applicable selling season, we are vulnerable to changes in consumer preferences and demand, pricing shifts, and the sub-optimal selection and timing of merchandise purchases.\nMoreover, there can be no assurance that we will continue to anticipate consumer demands and accurately plan inventory successfully in the future. Changing consumer preferences and fashion trends, whether we are able to anticipate, identify and respond to them or not, could adversely impact our sales. Inventory levels for certain merchandise styles no longer considered to be \u201con trend\u201d may increase, leading to higher markdowns to sell through excess inventory and, therefore, lower than planned margins. Conversely, if we underestimate consumer demand for our merchandise, or if our manufacturers fail to supply quality products in a timely manner, we may experience inventory shortages, which may negatively impact customer relationships, diminish brand loyalty and result in lost sales.\nWe could also be at a competitive disadvantage if we are unable to leverage data analytics to retrieve timely, customer insights to appropriately respond to customer demands and improve customer engagement. Any of these events could significantly harm our operating results and financial condition.\nIn addition to our own execution, we also need to react to factors affecting inventory flow that are outside our control, such as natural disasters or other unforeseen events that may significantly impact anticipated customer demand as we have seen with COVID-19. If we are not able to adjust appropriately to such factors, our inventory management may be affected, which could adversely impact our performance and our reputation.\nOur failure to operate in a highly competitive and constantly evolving industry could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nThe sale of apparel, personal care products and accessories for men, women and kids is a highly competitive business with numerous participants, including individual and chain specialty apparel retailers, local, regional, national and international department stores, discount stores and online-exclusive businesses. Proliferation of the digital channel within the last few years has encouraged the entry of many new competitors and an increase in competition from established companies. These increases in competition could reduce our ability to retain and grow sales, resulting in an adverse impact to our operating results and business.\nWe also face a variety of challenges in the highly competitive and constantly evolving retail industry, including:\n\u2022\nanticipating and quickly responding to changing consumer shopping preferences better than our competitors;\n\u2022\nmaintaining favorable brand recognition and effective marketing of our products to consumers in several diverse demographic markets;\n\u2022\nretaining customers, including our loyalty club members, as if we were to fail, it could result in increased marketing costs to acquire new customers;\n\u2022\ndeveloping innovative, high-quality merchandise in styles that appeal to consumers and in ways that favorably distinguish us from our competitors;\n\u2022\ncountering the aggressive pricing and promotional activities of many of our competitors without diminishing the aspirational nature of our brands and brand equity; and,\n\u2022\nidentifying and assessing disruptive innovation, by existing or new competitors, that could alter the competitive landscape by: improving the customer experience and heightening customer expectations; transforming supply chain and corporate operations through digital technologies and artificial intelligence; and enhancing management decision-making through use of data analytics to develop new, consumer insights.\nIn light of the competitive challenges we face, we may not be able to compete successfully in the future.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nDue to our international operations, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to our sales, profits, assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In addition, certain of our subsidiaries transact in currencies other than their functional currency, including intercompany transactions, which results in foreign currency transaction gains or losses. Furthermore, we purchase substantially all of our inventory in U.S. Dollars. As a result, our sales, gross profit and gross profit rate from international operations will be negatively impacted during periods of a strengthened U.S. dollar relative to the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries, as was the case in Fiscal 2019.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely impact consumer spending, delay or prevent successful penetration into new markets or could adversely affect the profitability of our international operations. Certain events, such as the uncertainty as to the ultimate scope and duration of COVID-19, the uncertainty surrounding the terms of United Kingdom\u2019s recent exit from the European Union and uncertainty with respect to trade policies, tariffs and government regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries, have increased global economic and political uncertainty in recent years and could result in volatility of foreign currency exchange rates as these events develop. For example, volatility of foreign currency exchange rates and changes in sales assumptions in response to COVID-19 has resulted in changes in the effectiveness of our hedging instruments, and we could see similar impacts in future periods.\nOur ability to attract customers to our stores depends, in part, on the success of the shopping malls or area attractions that our stores are located in or around.\nOur stores are primarily located in shopping malls and other shopping centers, certain of which have been experiencing declines in customer traffic. Our sales at these stores, as well as sales at our flagship locations, are partially dependent upon the volume of traffic in those shopping centers and the surrounding area. Our stores may benefit from the ability of a shopping center\u2019s other tenants and area attractions to generate consumer traffic in the vicinity of our stores and the continuing popularity of the shopping center. We cannot control the loss of a significant tenant in a shopping mall or area attraction, the development of new shopping malls in the U.S. or around the world, the availability or cost of appropriate locations or the success of individual shopping malls and there is competition with other retailers for prominent locations.\nIf the popularity of shopping malls declines among our customers, our sales may decline, and it may be appropriate to exit leases earlier than originally anticipated. In addition, COVID-19 has caused public health officials to recommend precautions to mitigate the spread of the virus, especially when congregating in heavily populated areas, such as shopping malls, and has caused us to recently enact widespread temporary store closures and our landlords to temporarily close certain of the malls in which our stores operate. There is significant uncertainty surrounding the ultimate duration of these closures and consumer willingness to visit shopping malls once they reopen. The impact of these temporary store and shopping mall closures on our current rent obligations remains uncertain and we may be limited in our ability to obtain rent abatements or landlord concessions of rent otherwise payable during this period of temporary store closures.\nAll of these factors may impact our ability to meet our productivity or our growth objectives for our stores and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Part of our future growth is dependent on our ability to operate\nstores in desirable locations, with capital investment and lease costs providing the opportunity to earn a reasonable return. We cannot be sure when or whether such desirable locations will become available at reasonable costs.\nThe impact of war, acts of terrorism, mass casualty events or civil unrest could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nIn the past, the impact of war, acts of terrorism, mass casualty events or civil unrest and the associated heightened security measures in response to these events have disrupted commerce. Further events of this nature, domestic or abroad, including the ongoing protests in China\u2019s Hong Kong SAR, may disrupt commerce and undermine consumer confidence and consumer spending by causing a decline in traffic, store closures and a decrease in digital demand adversely affecting our operating results.\nFurthermore, the existence or threat of any other unforeseen interruption of commerce, could negatively impact our business by interfering with the availability of raw materials or our ability to obtain merchandise from foreign manufacturers. With a substantial portion of our merchandise being imported from foreign countries, failure to obtain merchandise from our foreign manufacturers or substitute other manufacturers, at similar costs and in a timely manner, could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nThe impact of extreme weather, infectious disease outbreaks, including COVID-19, and other unexpected events could result in an interruption to our business, as well as to the operations of our third-party partners, and have a material adverse impact on our business.\nOur retail stores, corporate offices, distribution centers, infrastructure projects and digital operations, as well as the operations of our vendors and manufacturers, are vulnerable to disruption from natural disasters, infectious disease outbreaks and other unexpected events. These events could disrupt the operations of our corporate offices, global stores and supply chain and those of our third-party partners, including our vendors and manufacturers. In addition to impacts on global operations, these events could result in the potential loss of customers and revenues as a result of store closures, delay in merchandise deliveries, reduced consumer confidence or changes in consumers\u2019 discretionary spending habits.\nThese events could reduce the availability and quality of the fabrics or other raw materials used to manufacture our merchandise, which could result in delays in responding to consumer demand resulting in the potential loss of customers and revenues or we may incur increased costs to meet demand and may not be able to pass all or a portion of higher costs on to our customers, which could adversely affect our gross margin and results of our operations.\nWe could also be adversely affected if government authorities impose mandatory store closures, or restrict the import or export of products, in response to an unexpected event such as an infectious disease outbreak. Even if such measures are not implemented or infectious disease does not spread significantly, the perceived risk of infection or health risk may adversely affect our business and operating results.\nOur business has been materially, adversely impacted by COVID-19. At this point in time, there is significant uncertainty relating to the ultimate impact COVID-19 will have on the Company\u2019s business and the Company could experience further adverse impacts as the scope of COVID-19 evolves or if the duration of business disruptions from COVID-19 continues longer than initially anticipated, either of which could further adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity and capital resources. Refer to \u201cITEM 7. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.,\u201d for further discussion.\nIn addition, historically, our operations have been seasonal, and extreme weather conditions, including natural disasters, unseasonable weather or changes in weather patterns, may diminish demand for our seasonal merchandise and could also influence consumer preferences and fashion trends, consumer traffic and shopping habits. In addition, we may incur costs that exceed our applicable insurance coverage for any necessary repairs to damages or business disruption. Any of the factors listed above could reduce sales and profitability and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nSTRATEGIC RISKS.\nFailure to successfully develop an omnichannel shopping experience, a significant component of our growth strategy, or failure to successfully invest in customer, digital and omnichannel initiatives could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nAs omnichannel retailing continues to grow and evolve, our customers increasingly interact with our brands through a variety of media including smart phones and tablets, and expect seamless integration across all touchpoints. As our success depends on our ability to respond to shifting consumer traffic patterns and ability to engage our customers, we have made significant investments and significant operational changes to develop our digital and omnichannel capabilities globally, including the development of localized fulfillment, shipping and customer service operations, investments in digital media to attract new customers and the rollout of omnichannel capabilities listed in \u201cITEM 1. BUSINESS.\u201d\nWhile we must keep up to date with emerging technology trends in the retail environment in order to develop a successful omnichannel shopping experience, it is possible these initiatives may not prove to be successful, may increase our costs, may not succeed in\ndriving sales or attracting customers and could result in significant investments that do not provide the anticipated benefits or desired rates of return.\nIn addition, digital operations are subject to numerous risks, including reliance on third-party computer hardware/software and service providers, data breaches, violations of state, federal or international laws, including those relating to online privacy, credit card fraud, telecommunication failures and electronic break-ins and similar disruptions, and disruption of internet service. Changes in foreign governmental regulations may also negatively impact our ability to deliver product to our customers. Failure to successfully respond to these risks may adversely affect sales as well as damage the reputation of our brands.\nOur failure to optimize our global store network could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWhile the majority of sales occur within the stores channel, with the evolution of digital and omnichannel capabilities, customer expectations have shifted and there has been greater pressure for a seamless omnichannel experience across all channels. As a result, global store network optimization is an important part of our business and failure to optimize our global store network could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nOpportunities to open new stores experiences and modify existing leases requires partnership with our landlords. If our partnerships with our landlords were to deteriorate, this could adversely affect the pace of opening new store experiences. Pursuing the wrong opportunities and any delays, cost increases, disruptions or other uncertainties related to those opportunities could adversely affect our results of operations. If our investments in new stores or remodeling and right-sizing existing stores do not achieve appropriate returns, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nAlthough we attempt to open new stores in prominent locations, it is possible that prominent locations when we opened our stores may cease to be viewed as prominent. For example, our flagship stores, large-format stores in tourist locations with higher than average construction and operating costs, were initially successful upon opening, but are now outdated and, in aggregate, have a disproportionate adverse impact on operating results. The cost involved to modernize many of these flagship stores is significant and oftentimes without promise of a return. As a result, we may elect to exit these leases and other of our store leases earlier than originally anticipated, or modify the leases, which could result in material incremental charges, as seen in the second quarter of Fiscal 2019 when we closed the SoHo, New York City Hollister flagship store.\nOur failure to execute our international growth strategy successfully and inability to conduct business in international markets as a result of legal, tax, regulatory, political and economic risks could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nInternational expansion is a significant component of our growth strategy and may require significant investment, which could strain our resources and adversely impact current store performance, while adding complexity to our current operations.\nOperational issues that could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations if we fail to address them include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\naddress the different operational characteristics present in each country in which we operate, including employment and labor, transportation, logistics, real estate, lease provisions and local reporting or legal requirements;\n\u2022\nsupport global growth by successfully implementing local customer and product-facing teams and certain corporate support functions at our regional headquarters located in Shanghai, China and London, United Kingdom;\n\u2022\nhire, train and retain qualified personnel;\n\u2022\nmaintain good relations with individual associates and groups of associates;\n\u2022\navoid work stoppages or other labor-related issues in our European stores where associates are represented by workers\u2019 councils and unions;\n\u2022\nretain acceptance from foreign customers;\n\u2022\nmanage inventory effectively to meet the needs of existing stores on a timely basis; and\n\u2022\nmanage foreign currency exchange rate risks effectively.\nWe are subject to domestic laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, in addition to the laws of the foreign countries in which we operate. If any of our overseas operations, or our associates or agents, violate such laws, we could become subject to sanctions or other penalties that could negatively affect our reputation, business and operating results.\nIn addition, there continues to be global uncertainty, such as the uncertainty as to the ultimate scope and duration of COVID-19, the uncertainty surrounding the terms of United Kingdom\u2019s recent exit from the European Union and uncertainty with respect to trade policies, tariffs and government regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries, and similar events of global unrest. These events have increased global economic and political uncertainty in recent years and could affect our international expansion plans.\nOPERATIONAL RISKS.\nFailure to protect our reputation could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nOur ability to maintain our reputation is critical and public perception about our products or operations, whether justified or not, could impair our reputation, involve us in litigation, damage our brands and have a material adverse impact on our business. In addition, the broad use of social media allows for anyone to provide public feedback that could influence perceptions of our brands and reduce demand for our merchandise.\nEvents that could jeopardize our reputation, include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nWe fail to maintain high standards for merchandise quality and integrity;\n\u2022\nWe fall victim to a cyber-attack, which resulted in customer data being compromised;\n\u2022\nWe fail to comply with ethical, social, product, labor, health and safety, accounting or environmental standards, or related political considerations;\n\u2022\nOur associates\u2019 actions don\u2019t align with our values and fail to comply with our Associate Code of Conduct;\n\u2022\nOur third parties with which we have a business relationship, including our brand representatives, fail to represent our brands in a manner consistent with our brand image or act in a way that harms their reputation; and\n\u2022\nOur third party vendors fail to comply with our Vendor Code of Conduct or if any third parties with which we have a business relationship with fail to represent our brands in a manner consistent with our brand image.\nOur position or perceived lack of position on environmental, social, governance, public policy or other similar issues, including any actions we have taken in response to COVID-19, and any perceived lack of transparency about those matters could also harm our reputation with consumers or investors.\nDamage to our reputation and loss of consumer confidence for these or any other reasons could lead to adverse consumer actions, including boycotts, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation.\nIf our information technology systems are disrupted or cease to operate effectively it could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe rely heavily on our information technology systems in both our customer-facing and corporate operations to: operate our websites and mobile apps; record and process transactions; respond to customer inquiries; manage inventory, including our recently implemented markdown and size optimization tools; purchase, sell and ship merchandise, on a timely basis; maintain cost-efficient operations; create a customer relationship management database through our loyalty programs; and complete other customer-facing and business objectives. Given the significant number of transactions that are completed annually, it is vital to maintain constant operation of our computer hardware, telecommunication systems and software systems, and maintain data security. Despite efforts to prevent such an occurrence, our information technology systems may be vulnerable from time to time to damage or interruption from computer viruses, power system failures, third-party intrusions, inadvertent or intentional breach by our associates or third-party service providers, and other technical malfunctions. If our systems are damaged, fail to function properly, or are obsolete in comparison to those of our competition, we may have to make monetary investments to repair or replace the systems, and we could endure delays in our operations. The effectiveness of these investments can be less predictable than others and may fail to provide the expected benefits.\nWhile we regularly evaluate our information technology systems and requirements, we are aware of the inherent risks associated with replacing and modifying these systems, including inaccurate system information, system disruptions and user acceptance and understanding. Any material disruption or slowdown of our systems, including a disruption or slowdown caused by our failure to successfully upgrade our systems could cause information to be lost or delayed, including data related to customer orders. Such a loss or delay, especially if the disruption or slowdown occurred during our peak selling seasons, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe may be exposed to risks and costs associated with cyber-attacks, data protection, credit card fraud and identity theft that could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nIn the standard course of business, we receive and maintain confidential information about customers, associates and other third parties. In addition, third parties also receive and maintain certain confidential information. The protection of this information is critical to our business and subjects us to numerous laws, rules and regulations domestically and in foreign jurisdictions. The retail industry in particular has been the target of many recent cyber-attacks and it is possible that an individual or group could defeat our security measures, or those of a third-party service provider, and access confidential information.\nWe could experience increased costs associated with protecting confidential information through the implementation of security technologies, processes and procedures, including training programs for associates to raise awareness about phishing, malware and other cyber risks, especially as we implement new technologies, such as new payment capabilities or updates to our mobile apps and websites. Additionally, the techniques and sophistication used to conduct cyber-attacks and breaches of information technology systems change frequently and increase in complexity and are often not recognized until such attacks are launched or\nhave been in place for a period of time. We may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate, prevent, or immediately identifying cyber-attacks.\nFurthermore, the global regulatory environment is increasingly complex and demanding with frequent new and changing requirements surrounding cybersecurity, information security and privacy, including the China Cybersecurity Law, the California Consumer Privacy Act, and the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation. We may incur significant costs related to compliance with these laws and failure to comply with these regulatory standards, and others, could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nIn addition, our business has been adversely impacted by COVID-19, and as a result, we have seen an increase in the number of corporate associates working offsite. Offsite working by associates, increased use of public Wi-Fi, and use of office equipment off premises may be necessary, and may make our business more vulnerable to cybersecurity breach attempts. In addition, this period of uncertainty could result in an increase in phishing and other scams, fraud, money laundering, theft and other criminal activity.\nIf we, or a third-party partner, were to fall victim to a successful cyber-attack, suffer intentional or unintentional data and security breaches by associates or third-parties, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, especially an event that compromises customer data or results in the unauthorized release of confidential business or customer information. These and similar events could result in negative consequences, which may include but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nremediation costs, such as liability for stolen assets or information, potential legal settlements to affected parties, repairs of system damage, and incentives to customers or business partners in an effort to maintain relationships after an attack;\n\u2022\nincreased cybersecurity protection costs, which may include the costs of making organizational changes, deploying additional personnel and protection technologies, training associates, and engaging third party experts and consultants;\n\u2022\nlost revenues resulting from the unauthorized use of proprietary information or the failure to retain or attract customers following an attack;\n\u2022\nlitigation and legal risks, including costs of litigation and regulatory, fines, penalties or actions by domestic or international governmental authorities;\n\u2022\nincreased insurance premiums;\n\u2022\nreputational damage that adversely affects customer or investor confidence; and\n\u2022\ndamage to the company\u2019s competitiveness, stock price, and long-term shareholder value.\nAlthough we maintain cybersecurity insurance, there can be no assurance that it will be sufficient for a specific cyber incident, or that insurance proceeds will be paid to us in a timely fashion.\nOur reliance on our distribution centers makes us susceptible to disruptions or adverse conditions affecting our supply chain.\nOur distribution center operations are susceptible to local and regional factors, such as system failures, accidents, labor disputes, economic and weather conditions, natural disasters, demographic and population changes, as well as other unforeseen events and circumstances, including COVID-19. We rely on our distribution centers to manage the receipt, storage, sorting, packing and distribution of our merchandise. If our distribution operations were disrupted, and we were unable to relocate operations or find other property adequate for conducting business, our ability to replace inventory in our stores and process digital and third-party orders could be interrupted, potentially resulting in adverse impacts to sales or increased costs. Refer to \u201cITEM 1. BUSINESS,\u201d for a listing of certain distribution centers on which we utilize.\nChanges in the cost, availability and quality of raw materials, labor, transportation, and trade relations could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nChanges in the cost, availability and quality of the fabrics or other raw materials used to manufacture our merchandise and fluctuations in the cost of transportation could have a material adverse effect on our cost of sales, or our ability to meet customer demand. The prices for such fabrics depend largely on the market prices for the raw materials used to produce them, particularly cotton, as well as the cost of compliance with sourcing laws. The price and availability of such raw materials may fluctuate significantly, depending on many factors, including crop yields, weather patterns and other unforeseen events.\nIn addition, we have experienced increasing wage pressures in recent years, specifically with the cost of labor at our third-party manufacturers, at our distribution centers and at our stores. We may not be able to pass all or a portion of higher labor costs on to our customers, which could adversely affect our gross margin and results of operations.\nWe primarily use one contract carrier to ship merchandise and related materials to our North American stores and digital customers. If the shipping operations of this third-party were disrupted, and we are unable to respond in a quick and efficient manner, our ability to replace inventory in our stores and process digital and third-party orders could be interrupted, potentially resulting in adverse impacts to sales or increased costs.\nIn addition, there continues to be global uncertainty, such as to the ultimate scope and duration of COVID-19, the uncertainty surrounding the terms of United Kingdom\u2019s recent exit from the European Union and uncertainty with respect to trade policies, tariffs and government regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries, and similar events of global, political unrest.\nThese events have increased global uncertainty in recent years and could impact the cost, availability and quality of merchandise, and could impact the cost, availability and quality of the fabrics or other raw materials used to manufacture our merchandise.\nWe may not be able to pass all or a portion of higher raw materials prices or labor or transportation costs on to our customers, which could adversely affect our gross margin and results of operations. Such factors listed above may be exacerbated by legislation and regulations associated with global trade policies and climate change.\nWe depend upon independent third parties for the manufacture and delivery of all our merchandise, and a disruption of the manufacture or delivery of our merchandise could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities. As a result, the continued success of our operations is tied to our timely receipt of quality merchandise from third-party manufacturers. We source the majority of our merchandise outside of the U.S. through arrangements with approximately 120 vendors, primarily located in southeast Asia. Political, social or economic instability in the regions in which our manufacturers are located could cause disruptions in trade, including exports to the U.S. In addition, the inability of vendors to access liquidity, or the insolvency of vendors, could lead to their failure to deliver merchandise to us. A manufacturer\u2019s inability to ship orders in a timely manner or meet our quality standards could cause delays in responding to consumer demand and negatively affect consumer confidence or negatively impact our competitive position, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAll factories that we partner with are contractually required to adhere to the Company\u2019s Vendor Code of Conduct, go through social audits which include on-site walk-throughs to appraise the physical working conditions and health and safety practices, and review payroll and age documentation. If our factories are unwilling or not able to meet the standards set forth within the Vendor Code of Conduct it could limit the options available to us and could result in an increase of costs of manufacturing, which we may not able to pass on to our customers.\nOther events that could disrupt the timely delivery of our merchandise include new trade law provisions or regulations, reliance on a limited number of shipping carriers, significant labor disputes, significant delays in the delivery of cargo due to port security considerations or capacity limitations and other unexpected events, such as COVID-19. Furthermore, we are susceptible to increases in fuel costs which may increase the cost of distribution. If we are not able to pass this cost on to our customers, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on the experience and skills of our executive officers and associates, and the failure to attract or retain this talent, or effectively manage succession could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nOur ability to succeed may be adversely impacted if we are not able to attract, retain and develop talent and future leaders, including our executive officers. Our executive officers closely supervise all aspects of our operations, including the design of our merchandise, have substantial experience and expertise in the retail business and have an integral role in the growth and success of our brands. If we were to lose the benefit of the involvement of executives or other personnel, without adequate succession plans, our business could be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain talent at the associate level without adequate succession plans, our business could adversely be impacted as competition for such qualified talent is intense, and we cannot be sure we will be able to attract, retain and develop a sufficient number of qualified individuals in future periods.\nIn addition, COVID-19 has caused public health officials to recommend precautions to mitigate the spread of the virus, especially when congregating in heavily populated areas, such as shopping malls. Our business could be adversely affected if store associates are either unwilling or unable to staff our stores as a result of COVID-19 concerns.\nLEGAL, TAX, REGULATORY AND COMPLIANCE RISKS.\nFluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate may result in volatility in our results of operations could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe are subject to income taxes in many U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. In addition, our products are subject to import and excise duties and/or sales, consumption or value-added taxes (\u201cVAT\u201d) in many jurisdictions. We record tax expense based on our estimates of future payments, which include reserves for estimates of probable settlements of foreign and domestic tax audits. At any one time, many tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions. The results of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may affect the ultimate settlement of these issues. As a result, we expect that throughout the year, there could be ongoing variability in our quarterly tax rates as taxable events occur and exposures are evaluated. In addition, our effective tax rate in any given financial reporting period may be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings or losses by taxing jurisdictions or by changes to existing accounting rules or regulations. Fluctuations in duties could also have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nIn some international markets, we are required to hold and submit VAT to the appropriate local tax authorities. Failure to correctly calculate or submit the appropriate amounts could subject us to substantial fines and penalties that could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nTax law may be enacted in the future, domestically or abroad, that impacts our current or future tax structure and effective tax rate, such as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and Swiss Tax Reform discussed further in Note 11, \u201cINCOME TAXES.\u201d\nOur litigation exposure, or any securities litigation and shareholder activism, could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe, along with third parties we do business with, are involved, from time to time, in litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. Litigation matters may include, but are not limited to, contract disputes, employment-related actions, labor relations, commercial litigation, intellectual property rights, product safety and shareholder actions.\nShareholder activism, which could take many forms or arise in a variety of situations, has been increasing in publicly traded companies recently. Due to the potential volatility of our stock price and for a variety of other reasons, we may become the target of securities litigation or shareholder activism.\nAny litigation that we become a party to could be costly and time consuming and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. Our current litigation exposure could be impacted by various factors, including, but not limited to: litigation trends; discovery of additional facts with respect to legal matters pending against us; or determinations by judges, juries or other finders of fact that are not in accordance with management\u2019s evaluation of existing claims. Should management\u2019s evaluation prove incorrect, our exposure could greatly exceed expectations and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nFailure to adequately protect our trademarks could have a negative impact on our brand image and limit our ability to penetrate new markets which could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe believe our core trademarks, Abercrombie & Fitch\u00ae, abercrombie\u00ae, Hollister\u00ae, Gilly Hicks\u00ae and the \u201cMoose\u201d and \u201cSeagull\u201d logos, are essential to the effective implementation of our strategy. We have obtained or applied for federal registration of these trademarks with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and the registries of countries in key markets within the Company\u2019s sales and distribution channels. In addition, these trademarks are either registered, or the Company has applications for registration pending, with the registries of many of the foreign countries in which the manufacturers of the Company\u2019s products are located. There can be no assurance that we will obtain registrations that have been applied for or that the registrations we obtain will prevent the imitation of our products or infringement of our intellectual property rights by others. Although brand security initiatives are in place, we cannot guarantee that our efforts against the counterfeiting of our brands will be successful. If a third party copies our products in a manner that projects lesser quality or carries a negative connotation, our brand image could be materially adversely affected.\nBecause we have not yet registered all of our trademarks in all categories, or in all foreign countries in which we source or offer our merchandise now, or may in the future, our international expansion and our merchandising of products using these marks could be limited. The pending applications for international registration of various trademarks could be challenged or rejected in those countries because third parties of whom we are not currently aware have already registered similar marks in those countries. Accordingly, it may be possible, in those foreign countries where the status of various applications is pending or unclear, for a third-party owner of the national trademark registration for a similar mark to prohibit the manufacture, sale or exportation of branded goods in or from that country. Failure to register our trademarks or purchase or license the right to use our trademarks or logos in these jurisdictions could limit our ability to obtain supplies from, or manufacture in, less costly markets or penetrate new markets should our business plan include selling our merchandise in those non-U.S. jurisdictions.\nAdditionally, if a third party claims to have licensing rights with respect to merchandise we have produced or purchased from a vendor, we may be obligated to remove this merchandise from our inventory offering and incur related costs, and could be subject to liability under various civil and criminal causes of action, including actions to recover unpaid royalties and other damages.\nChanges in the regulatory or compliance landscape could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe are subject to numerous laws and regulations, including customs, truth-in-advertising, securities laws, consumer protection, general privacy, health information privacy, identity theft, online privacy, general employment laws, employee health and safety, minimum wage laws, unsolicited commercial communication and zoning and occupancy laws and ordinances that regulate retailers generally and/or govern the importation, intellectual property, promotion and sale of merchandise and the operation of retail stores, digital operations and distribution centers. If these laws and regulations were to change, or were violated by our management, associates, suppliers, vendors or other parties with whom we do business, the costs of certain merchandise could increase, or we could experience delays in shipments of our merchandise, be subject to fines or penalties, temporary or permanent store closures, increased regulatory scrutiny or suffer reputational harm, which could reduce demand for our merchandise and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Any changes in regulations, the imposition of additional regulations, or the enactment of any new or more stringent legislation including the areas referenced above, could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nLaws and regulations at the local, state, federal and various international levels frequently change, and the ultimate cost of compliance cannot be precisely estimated. In addition, there continues to be uncertainty as to the terms surrounding the United Kingdom\u2019s recent exit from the European Union and final terms could result in additional administrative burdens to adhere to changes in regulatory frameworks concerning critical areas, including, but not limited to, the movement of goods or the movement of people. Changes in the legal or regulatory environment affecting responsible sourcing, supply chain transparency, or environmental protection, among others, could also cause our costs to increase.\nThere is heightened uncertainty as to the ultimate scope and duration of COVID-19 and, as a result, government authorities have taken certain precautionary actions to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. These actions that have impacted our operations and any changes in regulations, the imposition of additional regulations, or the enactment of any new or more stringent legislation, could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations, including, but not limited to, the following actions: imposing restrictions on public gatherings and human interactions; requiring mandatory store closures or seeking voluntary store closures; restricting hours of store operations; imposing curfews; or restricting the import or export of products.\nIn addition, we are subject to a variety of regulatory, reporting requirements, including, but not limited to, those related to corporate governance and public disclosure. Stockholder activism, the current political environment, financial reform legislation, government intervention and regulatory reform may lead to substantial new regulations and disclosure obligations. New requirements or changes in current regulatory reporting requirements may introduce additional complexities, lead to additional compliance costs, divert management\u2019s time and attention from strategic business activities, and could have a significant effect on our reported results for the affected periods. Failure to comply with such regulations could result in fines, penalties, or lawsuits and could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nOur credit facilities include restrictive covenants that limit our flexibility in operating our business and our inability to obtain credit on reasonable terms in the future could have an adverse impact on our business.\nOur Asset-Based Revolving Credit Agreement, as amended, expires on October 19, 2022 and our Term Loan Agreement, as amended, has a maturity date of August 7, 2021. Both our Asset-Based Revolving Credit Agreement and our Term Loan Agreement contain restrictive covenants that, subject to specified exemptions, restrict our ability to incur indebtedness, grant liens, make certain investments, pay dividends or distributions on our capital stock and engage in mergers. In addition, the inability to obtain credit on commercially reasonable terms in the future could adversely impact our liquidity and results of operations. Changes in market conditions could potentially impact the size and terms of a replacement facility or facilities in the future.", "PERMNO": 83976, "SIC": 5651, "TIC": "ANF"}
