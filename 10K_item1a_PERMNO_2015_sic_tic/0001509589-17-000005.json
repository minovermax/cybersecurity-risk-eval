{"cik": "1509589", "company": "Bonanza Creek Energy, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nOur business involves a high degree of risk. If any of the following risks, or any risk described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer. The risks described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks not presently known to us or which we currently consider immaterial also may adversely affect us.\nRisks Related to Bankruptcy:\nWe are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with our Chapter 11 cases.\nOn January 4, 2017, the Company along with six of its subsidiaries, including Bonanza Creek Energy Operating Company, LLC, Bonanza Creek Energy Resources, LLC, Holmes Eastern Company, LLC, Rocky Mountain Infrastructure, LLC, Bonanza Creek Energy Upstream LLC, and Bonanza Creek Energy Midstream, LLC, filed voluntary petitions seeking relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code.\nOur operations and ability to develop and execute our business plan, our financial condition, our liquidity and our continuation as a going concern, are subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with our bankruptcy. These risks include the following:\n\u2022\nour ability to prosecute, confirm and consummate a plan of reorganization with respect to the Chapter 11 cases\u037e\n\u2022\nthe high costs of bankruptcy cases and related fees;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain sufficient financing to allow us to emerge from bankruptcy and execute our business plan post-emergence;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain our relationships with our suppliers, service providers, customers, employees, and other third parties\u037e\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain contracts that are critical to our operations\u037e\n\u2022\nour ability to safely and efficiently re-start operations after a protracted period of minimal activity;\n\u2022\nour ability to execute competitive contracts with third party contractors while tainted with a bankruptcy legacy;\n\u2022\nour ability to execute our business plan in the current commodity price environment\u037e\n\u2022\nour ability to attract, motivate and retain key employees;\n\u2022\nthe ability of third parties to seek and obtain court approval to terminate contracts and other agreements with us\u037e\n\u2022\nour ability to retain our current management team if a trustee is appointed;\n\u2022\nthe ability of third parties to seek and obtain court approval to convert the Chapter 11 cases to a Chapter 7 proceeding\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe actions and decisions of our creditors and other third parties who have interests in our Chapter 11 cases that may be inconsistent with our plans.\nDelays in our Chapter 11 cases increase the risks of our being unable to reorganize our business and emerge from bankruptcy and increase our costs associated with the bankruptcy process.\nThese risks and uncertainties could affect our business and operations in various ways. For example, negative events or publicity associated with our Chapter 11 cases could adversely affect our relationships with our suppliers, service providers, customers, employees, and other third parties, which in turn could adversely affect our operations and financial condition. Also, pursuant to the Bankruptcy Code, we need the prior approval of the Bankruptcy Court for transactions outside the ordinary course of business, which may limit our ability to respond timely to certain events or take advantage of certain opportunities. We also need Bankruptcy Court confirmation of the Plan. Because of the risks and uncertainties associated with our Chapter 11 cases, we cannot accurately predict or quantify the ultimate impact of events that occur during our Chapter 11 cases will have on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and there is no certainty as to our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe may not be able to obtain confirmation of a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization.\nTo emerge successfully from Bankruptcy Court protection as a viable entity, we must meet certain statutory requirements with respect to adequacy of disclosure with respect to a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization, solicit and obtain the requisite acceptances of such a reorganization plan and fulfill other statutory conditions for confirmation of such a plan. Although we have distributed to our creditors a disclosure statement with respect to the Plan and our solicitation of the Plan has been completed, certain parties in interest have filed objections to the Plan in an effort to persuade the Bankruptcy Court that we have not satisfied the confirmation requirements under section 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code. Those objections have not yet been addressed or ruled on by the Bankruptcy Court. The precise requirements and evidentiary showing for confirming a plan, notwithstanding its rejection by one or more impaired classes of claims or equity interests, depends upon a number of factors including, without limitation, the status and seniority of the claims or equity interests in the rejecting class (i.e., secured claims or unsecured claims, subordinated or senior claims, preferred or common stock).\nA confirmation hearing on the Prepackaged Plan has been scheduled to begin on April 3, 2017, but it is possible that hearing could be delayed. It is also possible that the Bankruptcy Court will not confirm the Prepackaged Plan. If the Prepackaged Plan is not confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court, it is unclear whether we would be able to reorganize our business and what, if anything, holders of claims against us would ultimately receive with respect to their claims.\nEven if a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization is consummated, we may not be able to achieve our stated goals and continue as a going concern.\nEven if the Prepackaged Plan or another Chapter 11 plan of reorganization is consummated, we will continue to face a number of risks, including further deterioration in commodity prices or other changes in economic conditions, changes in our industry, changes in demand for our oil and gas and increasing expenses. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee that the Plan or any other Chapter 11 plan of reorganization will achieve our stated goals.\nOur proposed Prepackaged Plan contemplates a $200 million rights offering that would strengthen our liquidity at emergence. However, if this rights offering is not approved by the Bankruptcy Court or otherwise does not occur, and even if our debts are reduced or discharged through a different confirmed plan, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing or other various means to fund our business after the completion of our Chapter 11 cases. Our access to additional financing is, and for the foreseeable future will likely continue to be, extremely limited, if it is available at all. Therefore, adequate funds may not be available when needed or may not be available on favorable terms, if they are available at all. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to raise additional capital. As a result, we cannot give any assurance of our ability to continue as a going concern, even if a plan is confirmed.\nWe have substantial liquidity needs and may not be able to obtain sufficient liquidity to confirm a plan of reorganization and exit bankruptcy.\nAlthough we have lowered our capital budget and reduced the scale of our operations significantly, our business remains capital intensive. In addition to the cash requirements necessary to fund ongoing operations, we have incurred significant professional fees and other costs in connection with our Chapter 11 cases and expect that we will continue to incur significant professional fees and costs throughout our Chapter 11 cases. Although we currently have $80.6 million of cash on hand, there are no assurances that our current liquidity is sufficient to allow us to satisfy our obligations related to the Chapter 11 cases, allow us to proceed with the confirmation of a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization and allow us to emerge from bankruptcy. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to secure additional interim financing or exit financing sufficient to meet our liquidity needs or, if sufficient funds are available, offered to us on acceptable terms.\nIn certain instances, a Chapter 11 case may be converted to a case under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.\nUpon a showing of cause, the Bankruptcy Court may convert our Chapter 11 case to a case under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. In such event, a Chapter 7 trustee would be appointed or elected to liquidate our assets for distribution in accordance with the priorities established by the Bankruptcy Code. We believe that liquidation under Chapter 7 would result in significantly smaller distributions being made to our creditors than those provided for in our Plan because of (i) the likelihood that the assets would have to be sold or otherwise disposed of in a distressed fashion over a short period of time rather than in a controlled manner and as a going concern, (ii) additional administrative expenses involved in the appointment of a Chapter 7 trustee, and (iii) additional expenses and claims, some of which would be entitled to priority, that would be generated during the liquidation and from the rejection of leases and other executory contracts in connection with a cessation of operations.\nWe believe it is highly likely that the shares of our existing common stock will be canceled in our Chapter 11 cases.\nThe Prepackaged Plan provides, among other things, that upon our emergence from bankruptcy, our existing common stock will be canceled, and the holders of our existing common stock will receive 4.5 percent of our post-emergence common stock (subject to dilution from a $200 million rights offering, a new management incentive plan, and warrants for existing equity holders) plus warrants to acquire up to 7.5 percent of the post-emergence common stock. If the Prepackaged Plan is confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court, the existing shareholders\u2019 post-emergence shares of common stock and warrants may be subject to further dilution due to subsequent capital raising activities. Additionally, the Prepackaged Plan may not be confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court, in which case, the chance that the existing shareholders will receive little or no distribution in our Chapter 11 cases may increase. Accordingly, any trading in shares of our common stock during the pendency of the Chapter 11 cases is highly speculative.\nWe may be subject to claims that will not be discharged in our Chapter 11 cases, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Bankruptcy Code provides that the confirmation of a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization discharges a debtor from substantially all debts arising prior to confirmation. With few exceptions, all claims that arose prior to confirmation of the plan of reorganization (i) would be subject to compromise and/or treatment under the plan of reorganization and (ii) would be discharged in accordance with the Bankruptcy Code and the terms of the plan of reorganization. Any claims not ultimately discharged through a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization could be asserted against the reorganized entities and may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations on a post-reorganization basis.\nOur financial results may be volatile and may not reflect historical trends.\nDuring the Chapter 11 cases, we expect our financial results to continue to be volatile as asset impairments, asset dispositions, restructuring activities and expenses, contract terminations and rejections, and claims assessments may significantly impact our consolidated financial statements. As a result, our historical financial performance is likely not indicative of our financial performance after the date of the bankruptcy filing.\nIn addition, if we emerge from Chapter 11, the amounts reported in subsequent consolidated financial statements may materially change relative to historical consolidated financial statements, including as a result of revisions to our operating plans pursuant to a plan of reorganization. We expect to be required to adopt fresh start accounting, in which case our assets and liabilities will be recorded at fair value as of the fresh start reporting date, which may differ materially from the recorded values of assets\nand liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Our financial results after the application of fresh start accounting also may be different from historical trends.\nTransfers of our equity, or issuances of equity in connection with our Chapter 11 cases, may impair our ability to utilize our federal income tax net operating loss carryforwards and depreciation, depletion and amortization deductions in future years.\nUnder federal income tax law, a corporation is generally permitted to deduct from taxable income net operating losses carried forward from prior years. We have net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $618.5 million as of December 31, 2016. Our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income and to reduce federal income tax liability is subject to certain requirements and restrictions. If we experience an \u201cownership change,\u201d as defined in section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, then our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and amortizable tax basis in our properties may be substantially limited, which could have a negative impact on our financial position and results of operations. Generally, there is an \u201cownership change\u201d if one or more stockholders owning 5% or more of a corporation\u2019s common stock have aggregate increases in their ownership of such stock of more than 50 percentage points over the prior three-year period. Following the implementation a plan of reorganization, it is possible that an \u201cownership change\u201d may be deemed to occur. Under section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, absent an applicable exception, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d the amount of its net operating losses that may be utilized to offset future taxable income generally is subject to an annual limitation. Further, future deductions for depreciation, depletion and amortization could be limited if the fair value of our assets is determined to be less than the tax basis.\nOur plan for reorganizing the Company may be delayed or altered due to actions by current equity security holders who disagree with our approach to restructuring.\nCertain holders of the Bonanza Creek Energy, Inc.\u2019s common shares have formed an ad hoc committee of equity security holders (the \u201cAd Hoc Equity Committee\u201d) and have filed motions and other pleadings in the Chapter 11 Cases adverse to the Restructuring contemplated by the RSA. In particular, on February 3, 2017, the Ad Hoc Equity Committee filed a motion (the \u201cTrustee Motion\u201d) for an order appointing a trustee pursuant to section 1104(a) of the Bankruptcy Code or, in the alternative, appointing an examiner pursuant to section 1104(c) of the Bankruptcy Code. If the Trustee Motion were granted with respect to the Ad Hoc Equity Committee\u2019s request for the appointment of a trustee, then the Debtors would cease to be debtors in possession and the affairs and management of the business would be controlled by a court-appointed trustee.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nFurther declines, in oil and, to a lesser extent, natural gas prices, will adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations and our ability to meet our capital expenditure obligations or targets and financial commitments.\nThe price we receive for our oil and, to a lesser extent, natural gas and NGLs, heavily influences our revenue, profitability, cash flows, liquidity, the borrowing base under any revolving credit facility that we are able to enter into following emergence from our Chapter 11 cases, access to capital, present value and quality of our reserves, the nature and scale of our operations and future rate of growth. Oil and natural gas are commodities and, therefore, their prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand. In recent years, the markets for oil and natural gas have been volatile. These markets will likely continue to be volatile in the future. Further, oil prices and natural gas prices do not necessarily fluctuate in direct relation to each other. Because approximately 75% of our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2016 were oil and NGLs, our financial results are more sensitive to movements in oil prices. Since mid-2014, the price of crude oil has significantly declined. As a result, we experienced significant decreases in crude oil revenues and recorded asset impairment charges due to commodity price declines. A prolonged period of low market prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs, like the current commodity price environment, or further declines in the market prices for oil and natural gas, will result in capital expenditures being further curtailed and will adversely affect our business, financial condition and liquidity and our ability to meet obligations, targets or financial commitments. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the daily NYMEX WTI oil spot price ranged from a high of $54.01 per Bbl to a low of $26.19 per Bbl, and the NYMEX natural gas HH spot price ranged from a high of $3.80 per MMBtu to a low of $1.49 per MMBtu. As of March 10, 2016, the daily NYMEX WTI oil spot price and NYMEX natural gas HH spot price was $48.49 per Bbl and $3.01 per MMBtu, respectively.\nThe prices we receive for our production, and the levels of our production, depend on numerous factors beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nworldwide and regional economic conditions impacting the global supply and demand for oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nthe actions from members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other oil producing nations;\n\u2022\nthe price and quantity of imports of foreign oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\npolitical conditions in or affecting other oil-producing and natural gas-producing countries, including the current conflicts in the Middle East and conditions in South America and Russia;\n\u2022\nthe level of global oil and natural gas exploration and production;\n\u2022\nthe level of global oil and natural gas inventories;\n\u2022\nlocalized supply and demand fundamentals and transportation availability;\n\u2022\nweather conditions and natural disasters;\n\u2022\ndomestic and foreign governmental regulations;\n\u2022\nspeculation as to the future price of oil and the speculative trading of oil and natural gas futures contracts;\n\u2022\nthe price and availability of competitors' supplies of oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\ntechnological advances affecting energy consumption;\n\u2022\nvariability in subsurface reservoir characteristics, particularly in areas with immature development history;\n\u2022\nthe availability of pipeline capacity and infrastructure; and\n\u2022\nthe price and availability of alternative fuels.\nSubstantially all of our production is sold to purchasers under contracts at market-based prices. Declines in commodity prices may have the following effects on our business:\n\u2022\nreduction of our revenues, profit margins, operating income and cash flows;\n\u2022\nreduction in the amount of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs that we can produce economically and may lead to reduced liquidity and the inability to pay our liabilities as they come due;\n\u2022\ncertain properties in our portfolio becoming economically unviable;\n\u2022\ndelay or postponement of some of our capital projects;\n\u2022\nsignificant reductions in future capital programs, resulting in a reduced ability to develop our reserves;\n\u2022\nlimitations on our financial condition, liquidity and/or ability to finance planned capital expenditures and operations;\n\u2022\nreduction to the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility or limitations in our access to sources of capital, such as equity or debt;\n\u2022\ndeclines in our stock price;\n\u2022\nrefinery industry demand for crude oil;\n\u2022\nstorage availability for crude oil;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our vendors, suppliers, and customers to continue operations due to the prevailing adverse market conditions;\n\u2022\nasset impairment charges resulting from reductions in the carrying values of our crude oil and natural gas properties at the date of assessment.\nOur production is not hedged, and we are exposed to fluctuations in the price of oil and will be affected by continuing and prolonged declines in the price of oil and natural gas.\nOil and natural gas prices are volatile, and the Company currently has none of its anticipated future production hedged. As a result, all of our future production will be sold at market prices, exposing us to the fluctuations in the price of oil and natural gas, unless we enter into new hedging transactions. To the extent that the price of oil and natural gas decline below current levels, our results of operations and financial condition would be materially adversely impacted. See the Derivative Activity section in Part I, Item I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a summary of our hedging activity.\nDue to reduced commodity prices and lower operating cash flows we may be unable to maintain adequate liquidity and our ability to make interest payments in respect of our indebtedness could be adversely affected.\nRecent declines in commodity prices have caused a reduction in our available liquidity, and we are now in bankruptcy. While we anticipate that substantially all of our $800.0 million of long-term unsecured indebtedness will be discharged upon confirmation of a plan of reorganization, we will continue to have substantial capital needs upon emergence from bankruptcy, including in connection with the continued development of our oil and gas assets. We may not have the ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations and, therefore, sufficient liquidity to meet our anticipated working capital, debt service and other liquidity needs.\nConcerns over general economic, business or industry conditions may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nConcerns over global economic conditions, energy costs, geopolitical issues, inflation, the availability and cost of credit, the European, Asian and the United States financial markets have contributed to increased economic uncertainty and diminished expectations for the global economy. In addition, continued hostilities in the Middle East and the occurrence or threat of terrorist attacks in the United States or other countries could adversely affect the global economy. These factors, combined with volatility in commodity prices, business and consumer confidence and unemployment rates, have precipitated an economic slowdown. Concerns about global economic growth have had a significant adverse impact on global financial markets and commodity prices. If the economic climate in the United States or abroad deteriorates, worldwide demand for petroleum products could diminish further, which could impact the price at which we can sell our production, affect the ability of our vendors, suppliers and customers to continue operations and ultimately adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nBorrowings under our revolving credit facility are limited by our borrowing base, which is subject to periodic redetermination.\nWe anticipate that the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility upon our emergence from bankruptcy will be redetermined on a periodic basis based upon a number of factors, including commodity prices and reserve levels. In addition, our lenders will also have substantial flexibility to reduce our borrowing base due to subjective factors. Upon a redetermination, we could be required to repay a portion of our bank debt to the extent our outstanding borrowings at such time exceed the redetermined borrowing base. We may not have sufficient funds to make such repayments, which could result in a default under the terms of the facility and an acceleration of the loans thereunder requiring us to negotiate renewals, arrange new financing or sell significant assets, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nDrilling for and producing oil and natural gas are high-risk activities with many uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur future financial condition and results of operations will depend on the success of our exploitation, exploration, development and production activities. Our oil and natural gas exploration and production activities are subject to numerous risks beyond our control, including the risk that drilling will not result in commercially viable oil or natural gas production. Our decisions to purchase, explore, develop or otherwise exploit drilling locations or properties will depend in part on the evaluation of data obtained through geophysical and geological analyses, production data and engineering studies, the results of which are often inconclusive or subject to varying interpretations. For a discussion of the uncertainty involved in these processes, see Our estimated proved reserves are based on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. Any significant inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves below. Our cost of drilling, completing and operating wells is often uncertain before drilling commences. Overruns in budgeted expenditures are common risks that can make a particular project uneconomical. Further, many factors, including, but not limited to, the following, may result in substantial losses, including personal injury or loss of life, penalties, damage or destruction of property and equipment, and curtailments, delays or cancellations of our scheduled drilling projects:\n\u2022\nshortages of or delays in obtaining equipment and qualified personnel;\n\u2022\nfacility or equipment malfunctions;\n\u2022\nunexpected operational events;\n\u2022\nunanticipated environmental liabilities;\n\u2022\npressure or irregularities in geological formations;\n\u2022\nadverse weather conditions, such as blizzards, ice storms, tornadoes, floods, and fires;\n\u2022\nreductions in oil and natural gas prices;\n\u2022\ndelays imposed by or resulting from compliance with regulatory requirements, such as permitting delays;\n\u2022\nproximity to and capacity of transportation facilities;\n\u2022\ntitle problems;\n\u2022\nsafety concerns, and\n\u2022\nlimitations in the market for oil and natural gas.\nOur estimated proved reserves and our ultimate number of prospective well development locations are based on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. Any significant inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves.\nThe process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves and the production possible from our oil and gas wells is complex. It requires interpretations of available technical data and many assumptions, including assumptions relating to current and future economic conditions and commodity prices. Any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves shown in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. See Estimated Proved Reserves under Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information about our estimated oil and natural gas reserves and the PV-10 (a non-GAAP financial measure) as of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.\nIn order to prepare our estimates, we must project production rates and the timing of development expenditures. We must also analyze available geological, geophysical, production and engineering data. The extent, quality and reliability of this data can vary. The process also requires economic assumptions about matters such as oil and natural gas prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds, and given the current volatility in pricing, such assumptions are difficult to make. Although the reserve information contained herein is reviewed by independent reserve engineers, estimates of oil and natural gas reserves are inherently imprecise particularly as they relate to state-of-the-art technologies being employed such as the combination of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling.\nActual future production, oil and natural gas prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves will vary from our estimates. Any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves shown in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our impairment charges. In addition, we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history, results of exploration and development, prevailing oil and natural gas prices and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nThe present value of future net revenues from our proved reserves will not necessarily be the same as the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves.\nYou should not assume that the present value of future net revenues from our proved reserves is the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we based the estimated discounted future net revenues from our proved reserves on the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month commodity prices for the preceding twelve months (after adjustment for location and quality differentials), without giving effect to derivative transactions. Actual future net revenues from our oil and natural gas properties will be affected by factors such as:\n\u2022\nactual prices we receive for oil and natural gas and hedging instruments;\n\u2022\nactual cost of development and production expenditures;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of actual production;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of future development costs;\n\u2022\nwellbore productivity realizations above or below type curve forecast models;\n\u2022\nthe supply and demand of oil and natural gas; and\n\u2022\nchanges in governmental regulations or taxation.\nThe timing of both our production and our incurrence of expenses in connection with the development and production of oil and natural gas properties will affect the timing and amount of actual future net revenues from proved reserves, and thus\ntheir actual present value. In addition, the 10% discount factor (the factor required by the SEC) used when calculating discounted future net revenues may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and natural gas industry in general.\nAs a result of the sustained decrease in prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs, we have taken write-downs of the carrying value of our properties and may be required to take further write-downs if oil and natural gas prices remain depressed or decline further or if we have substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves, increases in our estimates of development costs or deterioration in our drilling results.\nWe review our proved oil and natural gas properties for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that a decline in the recoverability of their carrying value may have occurred. Based on specific market factors and circumstances at the time of prospective impairment reviews, and the continuing evaluation of development plans, production data, economics and other factors, from time to time, we may be required to write-down the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties. A write-down constitutes a non-cash charge to earnings. Oil, natural gas and NGL prices have significantly declined since mid-2014 and have remained depressed through 2016. Due to a bid received while assets were held for sale, we recorded a $10.0 million impairment of oil and gas properties for the year ended December 31, 2016. Additionally, given the history of price volatility in the oil and natural gas markets, prices could remain depressed or decline further or other events may arise that would require us to record further impairments of the book values associated with oil and natural gas properties. Accordingly, we may incur significant impairment charges in the future which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and could reduce our earnings and stockholders\u2019 equity for the periods in which such charges are taken.\nWe intend to pursue the further development of our properties in the Wattenberg Field through horizontal drilling. Horizontal drilling operations can be more operationally challenging and costly relative to our historic vertical drilling operations.\nHorizontal drilling is generally more complex and more expensive on a per well basis than vertical drilling. As a result, there is greater risk associated with a horizontal well drilling program. Risks associated with our horizontal drilling program include, but are not limited to, the following, any of which could materially and adversely impact the success of our horizontal drilling program and thus, our cash flows and results of operations:\n\u2022\nlanding our well bore in the desired drilling zone;\n\u2022\neffectively controlling the level of pressure flowing from particular wells;\n\u2022\nstaying in the desired drilling zone while drilling horizontally through the formation;\n\u2022\nrunning our casing the entire length of the wellbore;\n\u2022\nrunning tools and other equipment consistently through the horizontal wellbore;\n\u2022\nfracture stimulating the planned number of stages;\n\u2022\npreventing downhole communications with other wells;\n\u2022\nsuccessfully cleaning out the well bore after completion of the final fracture stimulation stage; and\n\u2022\ndesigning and maintaining efficient forms of artificial lift throughout the life of the well.\nUltimately, the success of these drilling and completion techniques can only be evaluated over time as more wells are drilled and production profiles are established over a sufficiently long time period. If our drilling results are less than anticipated or we are unable to execute our drilling program because of capital constraints, lease expirations, access to gathering systems, limited takeaway capacity or depressed natural gas and oil prices, the return on our investment in these areas may not be as attractive as anticipated. Further, as a result of any of these developments, we could incur material impairments of our oil and gas properties and the value of our undeveloped acreage could decline in the future.\nOur ability to produce natural gas and oil economically and in commercial quantities could be impaired if we are unable to acquire adequate supplies of water for our drilling operations or are unable to dispose of or recycle the water we use at a reasonable cost and in accordance with applicable environmental rules.\nThe hydraulic fracture stimulation process on which we depend to produce commercial quantities of oil and natural gas requires the use and disposal of significant quantities of water. Our inability to secure sufficient amounts of water (including as a result of droughts), or to dispose of or recycle the water used in our operations, could adversely impact our operations. The imposition of new environmental initiatives and regulations could include restrictions on our ability to conduct\ncertain operations such as hydraulic fracturing or disposal of waste, including, but not limited to, produced water, drilling fluids and other wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of natural gas. Compliance with environmental regulations and permit requirements governing the withdrawal, storage and use of surface water or groundwater necessary for hydraulic fracturing of wells may increase our operating costs and cause delays, interruptions or termination of our operations, the extent of which cannot be predicted, and all of which could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.\nThe unavailability or high cost of additional drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, personnel and oilfield services could adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans within our budget and on a timely basis.\nShortages or the high cost of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, personnel or oilfield services could delay or adversely affect our development and exploration operations or cause us to incur significant expenditures that are not provided for in our capital budget, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations and may lead to reduced liquidity and the inability to pay our liabilities as they come due.\nOur exploration, development and exploitation projects require substantial capital expenditures. We may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms, which could lead to expiration of our leases or a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves or anticipated production volumes.\nOur exploration, development and exploitation activities are capital intensive. We make and expect to continue to make substantial capital expenditures in our business for the development, exploitation, production and acquisition of oil and natural gas reserves. Until such time as we obtain confirmation of a plan of reorganization in our bankruptcy proceeding and enter into a new revolving credit facility or obtain a different, comparable source of liquidity, there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient capital to meet these needs Without sufficient capital, we may face a further curtailment of our operations relating to development of our drilling locations, which in turn could lead to a possible expiration of our undeveloped leases and a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves, and an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIncreased costs of capital could adversely affect our business.\nRecent and continuing disruptions and volatility in the global financial markets may lead to an increase in interest rates or a contraction in credit availability, impacting our ability to finance our operations. Our business and operating results can be harmed by factors such as the terms and cost of capital, increases in interest rates or a reduction in credit rating. Changes in any one or more of these factors could cause our cost of doing business to increase, limit our access to capital, limit our ability to pursue acquisition opportunities, reduce our cash flows available for drilling, render us unable to replace reserves and production and place us at a competitive disadvantage.\nConcentration of our operations in a few core areas may increase our risk of production loss.\nOur assets and operations are concentrated in two core areas: the Wattenberg Field in Colorado and the Dorcheat Macedonia Field in southern Arkansas. These core areas currently provide approximately 99% of our current sales volumes and the vast majority of our development projects.\nThe Wattenberg and Dorcheat Macedonia Fields represent 81% and 19%, respectively, of our 2016 total sales volumes. Because our operations are not as diversified geographically as some of our competitors, the success of our operations and our profitability may be disproportionately exposed to the effect of any regional events, including: fluctuations in prices of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs produced from wells in the area, accidents or natural disasters, restrictive governmental regulations and curtailment of production or interruption in the availability of gathering, processing or transportation infrastructure and services, and any resulting delays or interruptions of production from existing or planned new wells. Similarly, the concentration of our assets within a small number of producing formations exposes us to risks, such as changes in field-wide rules, which could adversely affect development activities or production relating to those formations. In addition, in areas where exploration and production activities are increasing, as has been the case in recent years in the Wattenberg Field, we are subject to increasing competition for drilling rigs, oilfield equipment, services, supplies and qualified personnel, which may lead to periodic shortages or delays. These constraints and the resulting shortages or high costs could delay our operations and materially increase our operating and capital costs.\nWe do not maintain business interruption (loss of production) insurance for our oil and gas producing properties. Loss of production or limited access to reserves in either of our core operating areas could have a significant negative impact on our cash flows and profitability.\nWe have limited control over activities on properties in which we own an interest but we do not operate, which could reduce our production and revenues.\nWe do not operate all of the properties in which we have an interest. As a result, we may have a limited ability to exercise influence over normal operating procedures, expenditures or future development of underlying properties and their associated costs. For all of the properties that are operated by others, we are dependent on their decision-making with respect to day-to-day operations over which we have little control. The failure of an operator of wells in which we have an interest to adequately perform operations, or an operator\u2019s breach of applicable agreements, could reduce production and revenues we receive from that well. The success and timing of our drilling and development activities on properties operated by others depend upon a number of factors outside of our control, including the timing and amount of capital expenditures, the available expertise and financial resources, the inclusion of other participants and the use of technology. Our lack of control over non-operated properties also makes it more difficult for us to forecast capital expenditures, revenues, production and related matters.\nWe are dependent on third party pipeline, trucking and rail systems to transport our production and, in the Wattenberg Field, gathering and processing systems to prepare our production. These systems have limited capacity and at times have experienced service disruptions. Curtailments, disruptions or lack of availability in these systems interfere with our ability to market the oil and natural gas we produce, and could materially and adversely affect our cash flow and results of operations.\nMarket conditions or the unavailability of satisfactory oil and natural gas transportation arrangements may hinder our access to oil and natural gas markets or delay our production getting to market. The marketability of our oil and natural gas and production, particularly from our wells located in the Wattenberg Field, depends in part on the availability, proximity and capacity of gathering, processing, pipeline, trucking and rail systems. The amount of oil and natural gas that can be produced and sold is subject to limitation in certain circumstances, such as pipeline interruptions due to scheduled and unscheduled maintenance, excessive pressure, physical damage to the gathering or transportation system, or lack of contracted capacity on such systems. A portion of our production may also be interrupted, or shut in, from time to time for numerous other reasons, including as a result of accidents, maintenance, weather, field labor issues or disruptions in service. Curtailments and disruptions in these systems may last from a few days to several months. Any significant curtailment in gathering, processing or pipeline system capacity, significant delay in the construction of necessary facilities or lack of availability of transport, would interfere with our ability to market the oil and natural gas we produce, and could materially and adversely affect our cash flow and results of operations, and the expected results of our drilling program.\nCurrently, there are no natural gas pipeline systems that service wells in the North Park Basin, which is prospective for the Niobrara formation. In addition, we are not aware of any plans to construct a facility necessary to process natural gas produced from this basin. If neither we nor a third party constructs the required pipeline system and processing facility, we may not be able to fully develop our resources in the North Park Basin.\nThe development of our proved undeveloped reserves may take longer and may require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate. Therefore, our undeveloped reserves may not be ultimately developed or produced.\nApproximately 44% of our total proved reserves were classified as proved undeveloped as of December 31, 2016. Development of these reserves may take longer and require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate or that may be available to us. Delays in the development of our reserves or increases in costs to drill and develop such reserves will reduce the value of our estimated proved undeveloped reserves and future net revenues estimated for such reserves and may result in some projects becoming uneconomic. In addition, delays in the development of reserves could cause us to have to reclassify our proved reserves as unproved reserves.\nUnless we replace our oil and natural gas reserves, our reserves and production will decline, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn general, production from oil and gas properties declines as reserves are depleted, with the rate of decline depending on reservoir characteristics. Our current proved reserves will decline as reserves are produced and, therefore, our level of production and cash flows will be affected adversely unless we conduct successful exploration and development activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves. Thus, our future oil and natural gas production and, therefore, our cash flow and income are highly dependent upon our level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves. However, we cannot assure you that our future acquisition, development and exploration activities will result in any specific amount of additional proved reserves or that we will be able to drill productive wells at acceptable costs.\nWe may incur substantial losses and be subject to substantial liability claims as a result of our oil and natural gas operations. Additionally, we may not be insured for, or our insurance may be inadequate to protect us against, these risks, including those related to our hydraulic fracturing operations.\nOur oil and natural gas exploration and production activities are subject to all of the operating risks associated with drilling for and producing oil and natural gas, including, but not limited to, the possibility of:\n\u2022\nenvironmental hazards, such as spills, uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas, brine, well fluids, natural gas, hazardous air pollutants or other pollution into the environment, including groundwater and shoreline contamination;\n\u2022\nreleases of natural gas and hazardous air pollutants or other substances into the atmosphere (including releases at our gas processing facilities);\n\u2022\nhazards resulting from the presence of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) or other contaminants in natural gas we produce;\n\u2022\nabnormally pressured formations resulting in well blowouts, fires or explosions;\n\u2022\nmechanical difficulties, such as stuck oilfield drilling and service tools and casing collapse;\n\u2022\ncratering (catastrophic failure);\n\u2022\ndownhole communication leading to migration of contaminants;\n\u2022\npersonal injuries and death; and\n\u2022\nnatural disasters.\nAny of these risks could adversely affect our ability to conduct operations or result in substantial losses to us as a result of:\n\u2022\ninjury or loss of life;\n\u2022\ndamage to and destruction of property, natural resources and equipment;\n\u2022\npollution and other environmental damage;\n\u2022\nregulatory investigations and penalties;\n\u2022\nsuspension of our operations; and\n\u2022\nrepair and remediation costs.\nThe presence of H2S, a toxic, flammable and colorless gas, is a common risk in the oil and gas industry and may be present in small amounts for brief periods from time to time at our well locations. Additionally, at one of our Arkansas properties, we produce a small amount of gas from four wells where we have identified the presence of H2S at levels that would be hazardous in the event of an uncontrolled gas release or unprotected exposure. In addition, our operations in Arkansas and Colorado are susceptible to damage from natural disasters such as flooding, wildfires or tornados, which involve increased risks of personal injury, property damage and marketing interruptions. The occurrence of one of these operating hazards may result in injury, loss of life, suspension of operations, environmental damage and remediation and/or governmental investigations and penalties. The payment of any of these liabilities could reduce, or even eliminate, the funds available for exploration and development, or could result in a loss of our properties.\nAs is customary in the oil and gas industry, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these potential risks and losses. Although we believe the coverage and amounts of insurance that we carry are consistent with industry practice, we do not have insurance protection against all risks that we face, because we choose not to insure certain risks, insurance is not available at a level that balances the costs of insurance and our desired rates of return, or actual losses exceed coverage limits. Insurance costs will likely continue to increase which could result in our determination to decrease coverage and retain more risk to mitigate those cost increases. In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. If we incur substantial liability, and the damages are not covered by insurance or are in excess of policy limits, then our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.\nBecause hydraulic fracturing activities are part of our operations, they are covered by our insurance against claims made for bodily injury, property damage and clean-up costs stemming from a sudden and accidental pollution event. However,\nwe may not have coverage if the operator is unaware of the pollution event and unable to report the \u201coccurrence\u201d to the insurance company within the required time frame. We also do not have coverage for gradual, long-term pollution events.\nUnder certain circumstances, we have agreed to indemnify third parties against losses resulting from our operations. Pursuant to our surface leases, we typically indemnify the surface owner for clean-up and remediation of the site. As owner and operator of oil and gas wells and associated gathering systems and pipelines, we typically indemnify the drilling contractor for pollution emanating from the well, while the contractor indemnifies us against pollution emanating from its equipment.\nDrilling locations that we decide to drill may not yield oil or natural gas in commercially viable quantities.\nWe describe some of our drilling locations and our plans to explore those drilling locations in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our drilling locations are in various stages of evaluation, ranging from a location that is ready to drill to a location that will require substantial additional evaluation. There is no way to predict in advance of drilling and testing whether any particular location will yield oil or natural gas in sufficient quantities to recover drilling or completion costs or to be economically viable. Prior to drilling, the use of 2-D and 3-D seismic technologies, various other technologies and the study of producing fields in the same area will not enable us to know conclusively whether oil or natural gas will be present or, if present, whether oil or natural gas will be present in sufficient quantities to be economically viable. In addition, the use of 2-D and 3-D seismic data and other technologies requires greater pre-drilling expenditures than traditional drilling strategies, and we could incur greater drilling and testing expenses as a result of such expenditures which may result in a reduction in our returns or increase our losses. Even if sufficient amounts of oil or natural gas exist, we may damage the potentially productive hydrocarbon bearing formation or experience mechanical difficulties while drilling or completing the well, resulting in a reduction in production from the well or abandonment of the well. If we drill any dry holes in our current and future drilling locations, our profitability and the value of our properties will likely be reduced. We cannot assure you that the analogies we draw from available data from other wells, more fully explored locations or producing fields will be applicable to our drilling locations. Further, initial production rates reported by us or other operators may not be indicative of future or long-term production rates. In sum, the cost of drilling, completing and operating any well is often uncertain, and new wells may not be productive.\nOur potential drilling locations are scheduled to be developed over several years, making them susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling. In addition, we may not be able to raise the substantial amount of capital that would be necessary to drill a substantial portion of our potential drilling locations.\nOur management has identified and scheduled drilling locations as an estimation of our future multi-year drilling activities on our existing acreage. These potential drilling locations, including those without proved undeveloped reserves, represent a significant part of our growth strategy. Our ability to drill and develop these locations is subject to a number of uncertainties, including uncertainty in the level of reserves, the availability of capital to us and other participants, seasonal conditions, regulatory approvals, oil, natural gas and NGL prices, availability of permits, costs and drilling results. Because of these uncertainties, we do not know if the numerous potential drilling locations we have identified will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce oil or natural gas from these or any other potential drilling locations. Pursuant to existing SEC rules and guidance, subject to limited exceptions, proved undeveloped reserves may only be booked if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years of the date of booking, and we may therefore be required to downgrade to probable or possible any proved undeveloped reserves that are not developed within this five-year time frame. These limitations may limit our potential to book additional proved undeveloped reserves as we pursue our drilling program.\nCertain of our undeveloped leasehold acreage is subject to leases that will expire over the next several years unless production is established on units containing the acreage.\nThe terms of our oil and gas leases stipulate that the lease will terminate if not held by production, rentals, or production. As of the filing date of this report, the majority of our acreage in Arkansas was held by unitization, production, or drilling operations and therefore not subject to lease expiration. As of the filing date of this report, approximately 9,341 net acres of our properties in the Rocky Mountain region were not held by production. For these properties, if production in paying quantities is not established on units containing these leases during the next year, then approximately 4,809 net acres will expire in 2017, approximately 4,079 net acres will expire in 2018, and approximately 453 net acres will expire in 2019 and thereafter. While some expiring leases may contain predetermined extension payments, other expiring leases will require us to negotiate new leases at the time of lease expiration. It is possible that market conditions at the time of negotiation could require us to agree to new leases on less favorable terms to us than the terms of the expired leases. If our leases expire, we will lose our right to develop the related properties.\nWe may incur losses as a result of title deficiencies.\nThe existence of a title deficiency can diminish the value of an acquired leasehold interest and can adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Title insurance covering mineral leasehold interests is not generally available. As is industry standard, we may rely upon a land professional\u2019s careful examination of public records prior to purchasing or leasing a mineral interest. Once a mineral or leasehold interest has been acquired, we typically defer the expense of obtaining further title verification by a practicing title attorney until approval to drill the related drilling block is required. We perform the necessary curative work to correct deficiencies in the marketability of the title and we have compliance and control measures to ensure any associated business risk is approved by the appropriate Company authority. In cases involving more serious title deficiencies, all or part of a mineral or leasehold interest may be determined to be invalid or unleased, and, as a result, the target area may be deemed to be undrillable until owners can be contacted and curative measures performed to perfect title. In other cases, title deficiencies may result in our failure to have paid royalty owners correctly. Certain title deficiencies may also result in litigation to effectively agree or render a decision upon title ownership. Additional title issues are present in some of our southern Arkansas operations where significant delays in the title examination process are possible due to, among other challenges, the large volume of instruments contained in abstracts, poor indexing at the county clerk and recorder\u2019s office, unrecorded conveyances, misfiling of instruments, instruments with missing or inadequate legal descriptions and unclear conveyance terms.\nWe face various risks associated with the trend toward increased activism against oil and gas exploration and development activities.\nOpposition toward oil and gas drilling and development activity has been growing globally and is particularly pronounced in the United States. Companies in the oil and gas industry are often the target of activist efforts from both individuals and non-governmental organizations regarding safety, environmental compliance and business practices. Anti-development activists are working to, among other things, reduce access to federal and state government lands and delay or cancel certain projects such as the development of oil or gas shale plays. For example, environmental activists continue to advocate for increased regulations or bans on shale drilling in the United States, even in jurisdictions that are among the most stringent in their regulation of the industry. In fact, New York State enacted a permanent moratorium on all hydraulic fracturing operations, which became final in June 2015. Future activist efforts could result in the following:\n\u2022\ndelay or denial of drilling permits;\n\u2022\nshortening of lease terms or reduction in lease size;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on installation or operation of production, gathering or processing facilities;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the use of certain operating practices, such as hydraulic fracturing, or the disposal of related waste materials, such as hydraulic fracturing fluids and produced water;\n\u2022\nincreased severance and/or other taxes;\n\u2022\ncyber-attacks;\n\u2022\nlegal challenges or lawsuits;\n\u2022\nnegative publicity about us or the oil and gas industry in general;\n\u2022\nincreased costs of doing business;\n\u2022\nreduction in demand for our products; and\n\u2022\nother adverse effects on our ability to develop our properties and expand production.\nWe may need to incur significant costs associated with responding to these initiatives. Complying with any resulting additional legal or regulatory requirements that are substantial could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to health, safety and environmental laws and regulations that may expose us to significant costs and liabilities.\nWe are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations governing health and safety aspects of our operations, the discharge of materials into the environment and the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations may impose on our operations numerous requirements, including the obligation to obtain a permit before\nconducting drilling or underground injection activities; restrictions on the types, quantities and concentration of materials that may be released into the environment; limitations or prohibitions of drilling activities that impact threatened or endangered species or that occur on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas; the application of specific health and safety criteria to protect workers; and the responsibility for cleaning up any pollution resulting from operations. Numerous governmental authorities, such as the EPA and analogous state agencies, have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them, oftentimes requiring difficult and costly actions. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties; the imposition of investigatory or remedial obligations; the issuance of injunctions limiting or preventing some or all of our operations; delays in granting permits, or even the cancellation of leases.\nThere is an inherent risk of incurring significant environmental costs and liabilities in the performance of our operations, some of which may be material, due to our handling of petroleum hydrocarbons and wastes, our emissions into air and water, the underground injection or other disposal of our wastes, the use and disposition of hydraulic fracturing fluids, and historical industry operations and waste disposal practices. Under certain environmental laws and regulations, we may be liable for the full cost of removing or remediating contamination, regardless of whether we were at fault, and even when multiple parties contributed to the release and the contaminants were released in compliance with all applicable laws. In addition, accidental spills or releases on our properties may expose us to significant liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Aside from government agencies, the owners of properties where our wells are located, the owners or operators of facilities where our petroleum hydrocarbons or wastes are taken for reclamation or disposal, and other private parties may be able to sue us to enforce compliance with environmental laws and regulations, collect penalties for violations, or obtain damages for any related personal injury, property, or natural resource damage. Some sites we operate are located near current or former third-party oil and natural gas operations or facilities, and there is a risk that historic contamination has migrated from those sites to ours. Changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes that result in more stringent or costly requirements could require us to make significant expenditures to attain and maintain compliance or may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our own results of operations, competitive position or financial condition. We may not be able to recover some or any of these costs from insurance.\nNew environmental legislation or regulatory initiatives, including those related to hydraulic fracturing, could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays.\nWe are subject to extensive federal, state, and local laws and regulations concerning health, safety, and environmental protection. Governmental authorities frequently add to those requirements, and both oil and gas development generally, and hydraulic fracturing specifically, are receiving increasing regulatory attention. Our operations utilize hydraulic fracturing, an important and commonly used process in the completion of oil and natural gas wells in low-permeability formations. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, proppant, and chemicals under pressure into rock formations to stimulate hydrocarbon production.\nIn August 2012, the EPA issued final NSPS (known as \u201cQuad O\u201d) that establish new air emission controls for natural gas processing operations, as well as for oil and natural gas production. Among other things, Quad O imposes reduced emission completion (or \u201cgreen completion\u201d) requirements and also imposes stringent control and other standards on certain storage tanks, compressors and associated equipment. After several parties challenged the Quad O regulations in court, the EPA administratively reconsidered certain requirements. As a result of such administrative reconsideration, the EPA issued final amendments to the Quad O regulations in September 2013 and December 2014. In May 2016, the EPA finalized amendments to Quad O, now called Quad Oa, focused on achieving additional reductions in methane and volatile organic compound emissions at oil and natural gas operations. These rules, among other things, require leak detection and repair, additional control requirements for pneumatic controllers and pumps, and additional control requirements for oil well completions, gathering, boosting, and compressor stations. At this point, we cannot predict the cost to comply with such air regulatory requirements.\nOn December 17, 2014, the EPA proposed to revise and lower the existing 75 ppb NAAQS for ozone under the federal Clean Air Act to a range within 65-70 ppb. On October 1, 2015, EPA finalized a rule lowering the standard to 70 ppb. This lowered ozone NAAQS could result in an expansion of ozone nonattainment areas across the United States, including areas in which we operate. In a related development, in 2015 the State of Colorado received a bump-up to its existing ozone non-attainment status from \u201cmarginal\u201d to \u201cmoderate.\u201d This increased status will result in additional requirements under the CAA for the State of Colorado and will include a state rulemaking to implement such requirements. This rulemaking process started in early 2017. Oil and natural gas operations in ozone nonattainment areas may be subject to increased regulatory burdens in the form of more stringent emission controls, emission offset requirements, and increased permitting delays and costs.\nIn February 2014, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment\u2019s Air Quality Control Commission finalized regulations imposing strict new requirements relating to air emissions from oil and gas facilities in Colorado that are\neven more stringent than comparable federal rules. These new Colorado rules include storage tank control, monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting requirements as well as leak detection and repair requirements for both well production facilities and compressor stations and associated equipment. These new requirements, which represent the first time a state has directly regulated methane (a greenhouse gas) emissions from the upstream oil and gas sector, have and will continue to impose additional costs on our operations.\nSome activists have attempted to link hydraulic fracturing to various environmental problems, including potential adverse effects to drinking water supplies as well as migration of methane and other hydrocarbons and increased earthquakes. The federal government is studying the environmental risks associated with hydraulic fracturing and evaluating whether to adopt additional regulatory requirements. For example, the EPA has commenced a multi-year study of the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources. A draft assessment was published for public comment in 2015. The assessment concludes that while there are mechanisms by which hydraulic fracturing can impact drinking water resources, there was no evidence that these mechanisms have led to widespread, systemic impacts on drinking water resources in the United States. EPA\u2019s science advisory board, however, has subsequently questioned several elements and conclusions in EPA\u2019s draft assessment. In addition, in 2011, the EPA announced its intention to propose regulations under the federal Clean Water Act to regulate wastewater discharges from hydraulic fracturing and other natural gas production. EPA published these proposed rules in early 2015. The EPA also has issued guidance for issuing underground injection permits for hydraulic fracturing operations that use diesel fuel under the agency\u2019s SDWA authority.\nIn the United States Congress, bills have been introduced that would amend the SDWA to eliminate an existing exemption for certain hydraulic fracturing activities from the definition of \u201cunderground injection,\u201d thereby requiring the oil and natural gas industry to obtain SDWA permits for fracturing not involving diesel fuels, and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the process. If adopted, such legislation could establish an additional level of regulation and permitting at the federal level, but some form of chemical disclosure is already required by most oil and gas producing states. At this time, it is not clear what action, if any, the United States Congress will take on this exemption.\nMoreover, the U.S. Department of the Interior finalized new rules for hydraulic fracturing activities on federal lands that, in general, would cover disclosure of fracturing fluid components, well bore integrity, and handling of flowback water. The rule, while final, has been stayed pending the outcome of ongoing litigation. The BLM also proposed rules to address venting and flaring on BLM land, which the U.S. House of Representatives has passed a bill to repeal, and the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration has proposed stricter standards for worker exposure to silica, which would apply to use of sand as a proppant for hydraulic fracturing.\nApart from these ongoing federal initiatives, state governments where we operate have moved to impose stricter requirements on hydraulic fracturing and other aspects of oil and gas production. Colorado, for example, comprehensively updated its oil and gas regulations in 2008 and adopted significant additional amendments in 2011, 2014 and 2015. Among other things, the updated and amended regulations require operators to reduce methane emissions associated with hydraulic fracturing, compile and report additional information regarding well bore integrity, publicly disclose the chemical ingredients used in hydraulic fracturing, increase the minimum distance between occupied structures and oil and gas wells, undertake additional mitigation for nearby residents, implement additional groundwater testing and incur increased monetary penalties for violations of the State\u2019s oil and gas conservation commission rules and regulations. Similarly, in February 2015, a task force created by the State of Colorado aimed at making recommendations for minimizing land use and other conflicts concerning the location of new oil and gas facilities agreed upon nine consensus proposals which were sent to Governor Hickenlooper for his review. Three of the proposals require further legislative action, while the other six proposals require rulemaking or other regulatory action. The proposals support (i) a senate bill that would postpone expiration of recently adopted regulations regarding air emissions; (ii) tasking the COGCC with crafting new rules related to siting of \u201clarge-scale\u201d pads and facilities; (iii) requiring the industry to provide advance information about development plans to local governments; (iv) improving the COGCC\u2019s local government liaison and designee programs; (v) adding 11 full-time staffers to the COGCC to improve inspections and field operations; (vi) bolstering the inspection staff and equipment for monitoring oil and gas facility air emissions and setting up a hotline for citizen health complaints at the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment; (vii) creating a statewide oil and gas information clearinghouse; (viii) studying ways to ameliorate the impact of oil and gas truck traffic and (ix) creating a compliance-assistance program at the COGCC to help operators comply with the state's changing rules and ensure consistent enforcement of rules by state inspectors. A number of additional proposals did not receive sufficient task force support to be included with the nine consensus proposals, but may nevertheless be forwarded to the Governor as well. In early 2016, COGCC finalized a rulemaking to implement two of the nine recommendations noted above (numbers (ii) and (iii) specifically). With regard to recommendation (ii), the COGCC finalized rules applicable to the permitting of large-scale facilities in urban mitigation areas. For recommendation (iii), the COGCC finalized rules requiring operators to provide certain municipalities with notice prior to engaging in certain operations.\nIn some instances certain local governments are adopting new requirements on hydraulic fracturing and other oil and gas operations. Some counties in Colorado, for instance, have amended their land use regulations to impose new requirements on oil and gas development, while other local governments have entered memoranda of agreement with oil and gas producers to accomplish the same objective. In addition, voters in Colorado have proposed or advanced ballot initiatives restricting or banning oil and gas development in Colorado. Because a substantial portion of our operations and reserves are located in Colorado, the risks we face with respect to such ballot initiatives are greater than other companies with more geographically diverse operations. The adoption of future federal, state or local laws or implementing regulations imposing new environmental obligations on, or otherwise limiting, our operations could make it more difficult and more expensive to complete oil and natural gas wells, increase our costs of compliance and doing business, delay or prevent the development of certain resources (including especially shale formations that are not commercial without the use of hydraulic fracturing), or alter the demand for and consumption of our products and services. We cannot assure you that any such outcome would not be material, and any such outcome could have a material adverse impact on our cash flows and results of operations.\nClimate change laws and regulations restricting emissions of \u201cgreenhouse gases\u201d could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce, while the physical effects of climate change could disrupt our production and cause us to incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to those effects.\nThere is a growing belief that human-caused (anthropogenic) emissions of GHGs may be linked to climate change. Climate change and the costs that may be associated with its impacts and the regulation of GHGs have the potential to affect our business in many ways, including negatively impacting the costs we incur in providing our products and services and the demand for and consumption of our products and services (due to potential changes in both costs and weather patterns).\nIn December 2009, the EPA determined that atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane and certain other GHGs present an endangerment to public health and welfare, because such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to the warming of the earth\u2019s atmosphere and other climatic changes. Consistent with its findings, the EPA has proposed or adopted various regulations under the Clean Air Act to address GHGs. Among other things, the EPA began limiting emissions of GHGs from new cars and light duty trucks beginning with the 2012 model year. In addition, in 2010 the EPA published a final rule to address the permitting of GHG emissions from stationary sources under the Prevention of Significant Deterioration, or \u201cPSD,\u201d and Title V permitting programs. Under this rule, the EPA imposed certain GHG permitting requirements on the largest major sources first. As noted above, in June 2014, the United States Supreme Court invalidated part of the EPA\u2019s stationary source GHG program in Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA, No. 12-1146. Specifically, the Supreme Court ruled that major sources subject to the PSD or Title V programs because of non-GHG emissions could potentially be still subject to certain \u201cbest available control technology\u201d requirements applicable to their GHG emissions. Under the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion, sources subject to the PSD or Title V programs due solely to their GHG emissions can no longer be subject to the EPA\u2019s GHG permitting requirements. The D.C. Circuit issued an amended judgment following remand, and the EPA intends to conduct future rulemaking to revise its GHG major stationary source permitting program to conform to the court rulings. In a related development, in May 2016, the EPA finalized a rule to further define \u201cadjacency\u201d under the CAA for purposes of determining and permitting major stationary sources, including GHG major sources.\nThe EPA also adopted regulations requiring the reporting of GHG emissions from specific categories of higher GHG emitting sources in the United States, including certain oil and natural gas production facilities, which include certain of our operations, beginning in 2012 for emissions occurring in 2011. Information in such report may form the basis for further GHG regulation. Further, the EPA has continued with its comprehensive strategy for further reducing methane emissions from oil and gas operations, with a final rule being issued In May 2016 as part of the 2012 Quad O reconsideration known as \u201cQuad Oa.\u201d The EPA\u2019s GHG rules could adversely affect our operations and restrict or delay our ability to obtain air permits for new or modified facilities.\nMoreover, Congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs or promote the use of renewable fuels. As an alternative, some proponents of GHG controls have advocated mandating a national \u201cclean energy\u201d standard. The EPA recently finalized rules for both new and existing power plants known as the \u201cClean Power Plan\u201d designed to decrease GHG emissions from these sources. We are unable to predict how, or if, the Clean Power Plan will affect our operations. In addition, the United States reached agreement during the December 2015 United Nations climate change conference to reduce its GHG emissions by 26-28% by 2025 compared with 2005 levels, and also to provide periodic updates on its progress.\nIn the meantime, many states already have taken such measures, which have included renewable energy standards, development of GHG emission inventories or cap and trade programs. Cap and trade programs typically work by requiring major sources of emissions or major producers of fuels to acquire and surrender emission allowances, with the number of available allowances reduced each year until the overall GHG emission reduction goal is achieved. These allowances would be expected to escalate significantly in cost over time.\nThe adoption of legislation or regulatory programs to reduce emissions of GHGs could require us to incur increased operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems, to acquire emissions allowances or comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements. If we are unable to recover or pass through a significant level of our costs related to complying with climate change regulatory requirements imposed on us, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Any such legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, the oil and natural gas we produce. Consequently, legislation and regulatory programs to reduce emissions of GHGs could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCompetition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense, making it more difficult for us to acquire properties, market oil and natural gas and secure trained personnel.\nOur ability to acquire additional drilling locations and to find and develop reserves in the future will depend heavily on our financial resources and ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment for acquiring properties, marketing oil and natural gas and securing equipment and trained personnel. Also, there is substantial competition for capital available for investment in the oil and natural gas industry. Many of our competitors possess and employ financial, technical and personnel resources substantially greater than ours. Those companies may be able to pay more for productive oil and natural gas properties and exploratory drilling locations or to identify, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and locations than our financial or personnel resources permit. Furthermore, these companies may also be better able to withstand unsuccessful drilling attempts, sustained periods of volatility in financial markets and generally adverse global and industry-wide economic conditions, and may be better able to absorb the burdens resulting from changes in relevant laws and regulations, which would adversely affect our competitive position. In addition, companies may be able to offer better compensation packages to attract and retain qualified personnel than we are able to offer. We may not be able to compete successfully in the future in acquiring prospective reserves, developing reserves, marketing hydrocarbons, attracting and retaining quality personnel and raising additional capital, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf we fail to retain our existing senior management or technical personnel or attract qualified new personnel, such failure could adversely affect our operations. The volatility in commodity prices and business performance may affect our ability to retain senior management and the loss of these key employees may affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nTo a large extent, we depend on the services of our senior management and technical personnel. The loss of the services of our senior management, technical personnel, or any of the vice presidents of the Company, could have a material adverse effect on our operations or strategy. The volatility in commodity prices and our business performance may affect our ability to incentivize and retain senior management or key employees. Our current bankruptcy proceeding also has significant potential to adversely affect our ability to retain senior management and key employees. Competition for experienced senior management, technical and other professional personnel remains strong. If we cannot retain our current personnel or attract additional experienced personnel, our ability to compete could be adversely affected. Also, the loss of experienced personnel could lead to a loss of technical expertise. We do not maintain, nor do we plan to obtain, any insurance against the loss of any of these individuals.\nOur derivative activities could result in financial losses or could reduce our income.\nTo achieve more predictable cash flows and to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in the prices of oil and natural gas, we may in the future enter into derivative arrangements for a portion of our oil and natural gas production, including collars and fixed-price swaps. We have not in the past designated any of our derivative instruments as hedges for accounting purposes and have recorded all derivative instruments on our balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of our derivative instruments are recognized in earnings. Accordingly, our earnings may fluctuate significantly as a result of changes in the fair value of our derivative instruments.\nDerivative arrangements also expose us to the risk of financial loss in some circumstances, including when:\n\u2022\nproduction is less than the volume covered by the derivative instruments;\n\u2022\nthe counterparty to the derivative instrument defaults on its contract obligations; or\n\u2022\nthere is an increase in the differential between the underlying price in the derivative instrument and actual prices received.\nIn addition, these types of derivative arrangements may limit the benefit we would receive from increases in the prices for oil and natural gas and may expose us to cash margin requirements.\nWe are exposed to credit risks of our hedging counterparties, third parties participating in our wells and our customers.\nOur principal exposures to credit risk are through receivables resulting from commodity derivatives instruments, which were zero at December 31, 2016 (but would increase if we resume a hedging program), joint interest and other receivables of $6.8 million at December 31, 2016 and the sale of our oil, natural gas and NGLs production of $14.5 million in receivables at December 31, 2016, which we market to energy marketing companies, refineries and affiliates.\nJoint interest receivables arise from billing entities who own partial interest in the wells we operate. These entities participate in our wells primarily based on their ownership in leases on which we wish to drill. We can do very little to choose who participates in our wells.\nWe are also subject to credit risk due to concentration of our oil, natural gas and NGLs receivables with significant customers. This concentration of customers may impact our overall credit risk since these entities may be similarly affected by changes in economic and other conditions. For the year ended December 31, 2016, sales to Silo Energy, LLC, Lion Oil Trading & Transport, Inc., and Duke Energy Field Services accounted for approximately 50%, 18% and 14%, respectively, of our total sales. Beginning in 2017 and continuing for seven years, we have contracted to sell all of our crude oil produced for a one-rig program in the Wattenberg Field to NGL Crude Logistics, LLC.\nWe are exposed to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty, principally with respect to hedging agreements but also insurance contracts and bank lending commitments. We do not require most of our customers to post collateral. The inability or failure of our significant customers to meet their obligations to us or their insolvency or liquidation may adversely affect our financial results. Deterioration in the credit markets may impact the credit ratings of our current and potential counterparties and affect their ability to fulfill their existing obligations to us and their willingness to enter into future transactions with us.\nCurrent or proposed financial legislation and rulemaking could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of commodity price, interest rate and other risks associated with our business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act establishes, among other provisions, federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities that participate in that market. The Dodd-Frank Act also establishes margin requirements and certain transaction clearing and trade execution requirements. The Dodd-Frank Act may require us to comply with margin requirements in our derivative activities, although the application of those provisions to us is uncertain at this time. The financial reform legislation may also require the counterparties to our derivative instruments to spin off some of their derivatives activities to separate entities, which may not be as creditworthy as the current counterparties.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act and any new regulations could significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts (including through requirements to post collateral, which could adversely affect our available liquidity), materially alter the terms of derivative contracts, reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we encounter, reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts and increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties. If we reduce our use of derivative as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations, our results of operations may be more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures.\nWe may be involved in legal cases that may result in substantial liabilities.\nLike many oil and gas companies, we are from time to time involved in various legal and other cases, such as title, royalty or contractual disputes, regulatory compliance matters and personal injury or property damage matters, in the ordinary course of our business. Such legal cases are inherently uncertain and their results cannot be predicted. Regardless of the outcome, such cases could have an adverse impact on us because of legal costs, diversion of management and other personnel and other factors. In addition, it is possible that a resolution of one or more such cases could result in liability, penalties or sanctions, as well as judgments, consent decrees or orders requiring a change in our business practices, which could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Accruals for such liability, penalties or sanctions may be insufficient. Judgments and estimates to determine accruals or range of losses related to legal and other cases could change from one period to the next, and such changes could be material.\nWe are subject to federal, state, and local taxes, and may become subject to new taxes and certain federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to oil and gas exploration and development may be eliminated as a result of future legislation.\nThe federal, state and local governments in the areas in which we operate impose taxes on the oil and natural gas products we sell, and, for many of our wells, sales and use taxes on significant portions of our drilling and operating costs. Many states have raised state taxes on energy sources or state taxes associated with the extraction of hydrocarbons and additional increases may occur. In addition, there has been a significant amount of discussion by legislators and presidential administrations concerning a variety of energy tax proposals.\nThere have been proposals for legislative changes that, if enacted into law, would eliminate certain key U.S. federal income tax incentives currently available to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies. Such changes include, but are not limited to, (i) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas properties; (ii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs; (iii) the elimination of the deduction for certain U.S. production activities; and (iv) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. It is unclear whether these or similar changes will be enacted and, if enacted, how soon any such changes could become effective. Any such changes in U.S. federal income tax law could eliminate or defer certain tax deductions within the industry that are currently available with respect to oil and gas exploration and development, and any such change could negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nChanges to federal tax deductions, as well as any changes to or the imposition of new state or local taxes (including production, severance or similar taxes) could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to cyber security risks. A cyber incident could occur and result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption or financial loss.\nThe oil and gas industry has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct certain exploration, development, production, processing and distribution activities. For example, we depend on digital technologies to interpret seismic data, manage drilling rigs, production equipment and gathering and transportation systems, conduct reservoir modeling and reserves estimation and process and record financial and operating data. Pipelines, refineries, power stations and distribution points for both fuels and electricity are becoming more interconnected by computer systems. At the same time, cyber incidents, including deliberate attacks or unintentional events, have increased. Our technologies, systems, networks and those of our vendors, suppliers and other business partners may become the target of cyber-attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of proprietary and other information, or other disruption of our business operations. In addition, weaknesses in the cyber security of our vendors, suppliers, and other business partners could facilitate an attack on our technologies, systems and networks. In addition, certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance, may remain undetected for an extended period. Given the politically sensitive nature of hydraulic fracturing and the controversy generated by its opponents, our technologies, systems and networks may be of particular interest to certain groups with political agendas, which may seek to launch cyber-attacks as a method of promoting their message. Our systems and insurance coverage for protecting against cyber security risks may not be sufficient.\nWe depend on digital technology, including information systems and related infrastructure, as well as cloud applications and services, to process and record financial and operating data, communicate with our employees and business parties, analyze seismic and drilling information, estimate quantities of oil and gas reserves as well as other activities related to our business. Our business partners, including vendors, service providers, purchasers of our production and financial institutions, are also dependent on digital technology. The technologies needed to conduct our oil and gas exploration and development activities make certain information the target of theft or misappropriation.\nAlthough to date we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber-attacks, we may suffer such losses in the future.\nRisks Relating to our Common Stock\nWe do not intend to pay, and we are currently prohibited from paying, dividends on our common stock and, consequently, our stockholders\u2019 only opportunity to achieve a return on their investment is if the price of our stock appreciates.\nWe do not plan to declare dividends on shares of our common stock in the foreseeable future. Additionally, we are currently prohibited from making any cash dividends pursuant to the terms of our revolving credit facility and our Senior Notes. Consequently, our stockholders\u2019 only opportunity to achieve a return on their investment in us will be if the market price of our common stock appreciates, which may not occur, and the stockholders sell their shares at a profit. There is no guarantee that the price of our common stock will ever exceed the price that the stockholders paid.\nWe have experienced recent volatility in the market price and trading volume of our common stock and may continue to do so in the future.\nThe trading price of shares of our common stock has fluctuated widely and in the future may be subject to similar fluctuations. As an example, during the year ended December 31, 2016, the sales price of our common stock ranged from a low of $0.60 per share to a high of $5.50 per share. The trading price of our common stock may be affected by a number of factors, including our bankruptcy proceeding, the volatility of oil, natural gas, and NGL prices, our operating results, changes in our earnings estimates, additions or departures of key personnel, our financial condition and liquidity, drilling activities, legislative and regulatory changes, general conditions in the oil and natural gas exploration and development industry, general economic conditions, and general conditions in the securities markets. In particular, a significant or extended decline in oil, natural gas and NGL prices could have a material adverse effect our sales price of our common stock. Other risks described in this annual report could also materially and adversely affect our share price.\nAlthough our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, we cannot assure you that an active public market will continue for our common stock or that will be able to continue to meet the listing requirements of the NYSE. If an active public market for our common stock does not continue, the trading price and liquidity of our common stock will be materially and adversely affected. If there is a thin trading market or \"float\" for our stock, the market price for our common stock may fluctuate significantly more than the stock market as a whole. Without a large float, our common stock would be less liquid than the stock of companies with broader public ownership and, as a result, the trading prices of our common stock may be more volatile. In addition, in the absence of an active public trading market, investors may be unable to liquidate their investment in us.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as Delaware law, contain provisions that could discourage acquisition bids or merger proposals, even if such acquisition or merger may be in our stockholders\u2019 best interests.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval. If our board of directors elects to issue preferred stock, it could be more difficult for a third party to acquire us. In addition, some provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the change of control would be beneficial to our stockholders, including:\n\u2022\na classified board of directors, so that only approximately one-third of our directors are elected each year;\n\u2022\nadvance notice provisions for stockholder proposals and nominations for elections to the board of directors to be acted upon at meetings of stockholders; and\n\u2022\nlimitations on the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings or act by written consent.\nDelaware law prohibits us from engaging in any business combination with any \u201cinterested stockholder,\u201d meaning generally that a stockholder who beneficially owns more than 15% of our stock cannot acquire us for a period of three years from the date this person became an interested stockholder, unless various conditions are met, such as approval of the transaction by our board of directors.", "PERMNO": 13116, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "BCEI"}
