{"cik": "866729", "company": "SCHOLASTIC CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-07-24", "item_1A": "Item 1A | Risk Factors\nSet forth below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in other documents that the Corporation files with the SEC are risks that should be considered in evaluating the Corporation\u2019s common stock, as well as risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual future results of the Company to differ from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements contained in this Report and in other public statements the Company makes. Additionally, because of the following risks and uncertainties, as well as other variables affecting the Company\u2019s operating results, the Company\u2019s past financial performance should not be considered an indicator of future performance.\nIf we cannot anticipate trends and develop new products or adapt to new technologies responding to changing customer preferences, this could adversely affect our revenues or profitability.\nThe Company operates in highly competitive markets that are subject to rapid change, including, in particular, changes in customer preferences and changes and advances in relevant technologies. There are substantial uncertainties associated with the Company\u2019s efforts to develop successful trade publishing, educational, and media products and services, including digital products and services, for its customers, as well as to adapt its print and other materials to new digital technologies, including the internet cloud technologies, ebook readers, tablets and other devices and school-based technologies. The Company makes significant investments in new products and services that may not be profitable, or whose profitability may be significantly lower than the Company anticipates or has experienced historically. In particular, in the context of the Company\u2019s current focus on key digital opportunities, including ebooks for children and schools, the markets are continuing to develop and the Company may be unsuccessful in establishing itself as a significant factor in any market which does develop. Many aspects of an ebook market which could develop for children and schools, such as the nature of the relevant software and hardware, the size of the market, relevant methods of delivery and relevant content, as well as pricing models, are still evolving and will, most likely, be subject to change on a recurrent basis until a pattern develops and becomes more defined. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in implementing its ebook strategy, including the continuing development of its ereading applications for consumer and classroom markets, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s revenues and growth opportunities. In this connection, the Company previously determined to cease its support for its ereading applications offered to consumers through its school and ecommerce channels in favor of concentrating its efforts towards the introduction of a universal cross-platform streaming application, to be made available initially to the classroom market. There can be no assurance that the Company will ultimately be successful in its redirected strategy of introducing a streaming model directed to the classroom market or the subsequent development of a broader streaming model. In addition, the Company faces market risks associated with systems development and service delivery in its evolving school ordering and ecommerce businesses.\nOur financial results would suffer if we fail to successfully differentiate our offerings and meet market needs in school-based book clubs and book fairs, two of our core businesses.\nThe Company\u2019s school-based book clubs and book fairs are core businesses, which produce a substantial part of the Company\u2019s revenues. The Company is subject to the risks that it will not successfully continue to develop and execute new promotional strategies for its school-based book clubs or book fairs in response to future customer trends, including any trends relating to a demand for ebooks on the part of customers, or technological changes or that it will not otherwise meet market needs in these businesses in a timely or cost-effective fashion and successfully engage a newer millennial teacher population in order to increase current teacher sponsorship in its book club business, as well as maintain school sponsorship at the planned level in its book fair business and ordering levels in each of these businesses, which would have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial results. The Company differentiates itself from competitors by providing curated offerings in its school-based book clubs and book fairs designed to make reading attractive for children, in furtherance of its mission as a champion of literacy. Competition from mass market and on-line distributors using customer-specific curation tools could reduce this differentiation, posing a risk to the Company's results.\nIf we fail to maintain the continuance of strong relationships with our authors, illustrators and other creative talent, as well as to develop relationships with new creative talent, our business could be adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s business, in particular the trade publishing and media portions of the business, is highly dependent on maintaining strong relationships with the authors, illustrators and other creative talent who produce the products and services that are sold to its customers. Any overall weakening of these relationships, or the failure to develop successful new relationships, could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business and financial performance.\nWe own certain significant real estate assets which are subject to various risks related to conditions affecting the real estate market.\nThe Company has direct ownership of certain significant real estate assets, in particular, the Company\u2019s headquarters location in New York City and its primary distribution center in Jefferson City, Missouri. The New York headquarters location serves a dual purpose as it also contains premium retail space that is, from time to time, leased to retail tenants in order to generate rental income and cash flow, and the Company is currently engaged in a renovation of its New York headquarters which will include making additional space available for retail use. Accordingly, the Company is sensitive to various risk factors such as changes to real estate values and property taxes, pricing and demand for high end retail spaces in Soho, New York City, interest rates, cash flow of underlying real estate assets, supply and demand, and the credit worthiness of any retail tenants. There is also no guarantee that investment objectives for the retail component of the Company\u2019s real estate will be achieved.\nIf we fail to adapt to new purchasing patterns or trends, our business and financial results could be adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s business is affected significantly by changes in customer purchasing patterns or trends in, as well as the underlying strength of, the trade, educational and media markets for children. In particular, the Company\u2019s educational publishing business may be adversely affected by budgetary restraints and other changes in educational funding as a result of new policies which could result from the recent change in administration and changes in the Department of Education at the federal level or otherwise resulting from new legislation or regulatory action, whether at the federal, state or local level, as well as changes in the procurement process, to which the Company may be unable to adapt successfully. In addition, there are many competing demands for educational funds, and there can be no guarantee that the Company will otherwise be successful in continuing to obtain sales of its educational materials and programs from any available funding.\nThe competitive pressures we face in our businesses could adversely affect our financial performance and growth prospects.\nThe Company is subject to significant competition, including from other trade and educational publishers and media, entertainment and internet companies, as well as retail and internet distributors, many of which are substantially larger than the Company and have much greater resources. To the extent the Company cannot meet these challenges from existing or new competitors, including in the educational publishing business, and develop new product offerings to meet customer preferences or needs, the Company\u2019s revenues and profitability could be adversely affected.\nAdditionally, demand for many of the Company\u2019s product offerings, particularly books sold through school channels, is subject to price sensitivity. Failure to maintain a competitive pricing model could reduce revenues and profitability.\nOur reputation is one of our most important assets, and any adverse publicity or adverse events, such as a significant data privacy breach or violation of privacy laws or regulations, could cause significant reputational damage and financial loss.\nThe businesses of the Company focus on children\u2019s reading, learning and education, and its key relationships are with educators, teachers, parents and children. In particular, the Company believes that, in selecting its products, teachers, educators and parents rely on the Company\u2019s reputation for quality books and educational materials and programs appropriate for children. Negative publicity, either through traditional media or through social media, could tarnish this relationship.\nAlso, in certain of its businesses the Company holds or has access to personal data, including that of customers. Adverse publicity stemming from a data breach, whether or not valid, could reduce demand for the Company\u2019s products or adversely affect its relationship with teachers or educators, impacting participation in book clubs or book fairs or decisions to purchase educational materials or programs produced by the Company's Education segment. Further, a failure to adequately protect personal data, including that of customers or children, or other data security failure, such as cyber attacks from third parties, could lead to penalties, significant remediation costs and reputational damage, including loss of future business.\nThe Company is subject to privacy laws and regulations in the conduct of its business in the United States and in other jurisdictions in which it conducts its international operations, many of which vary significantly, relating to use of information obtained from customers of, and participants in, the Company\u2019s on-line offerings. In addition, the Company is also subject to the regulatory requirements of the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act (\"COPPA\") in\nthe United States relating to access to, and the use of information received from, children in respect to the Company\u2019s on-line offerings. Since the businesses of the Company are primarily centered on children, failures of the Company to comply with the requirements of COPPA and similar laws in particular, as well as failures to comply generally with applicable privacy laws and regulations, could lead to significant reputational damage and other penalties and costs, including loss of future business.\nWe maintain an experienced and dedicated employee base that executes the Company\u2019s strategies. Failure to attract, retain and develop this employee base could result in difficulty with executing our strategy.\nThe Company\u2019s employees, notably its Chief Executive Officer, senior executives and other editorial staff members, have substantial experience in the publishing and education markets. Inability to adequately maintain a workforce of this nature could negatively impact the Company\u2019s operations.\nIf we are unsuccessful in implementing our corporate strategy we may not be able to maintain our historical growth.\nThe Company\u2019s future growth depends upon a number of factors, including the ability of the Company to successfully implement its strategies for its respective business units in a timely manner, the introduction and acceptance of new products and services, including the success of its digital strategy and its ability to implement and successfully market new programs in its educational publishing business, as well as through the Company's developing educational publishing operation in Singapore, its ability to expand in the global markets that it serves, its ability to meet demand for content meeting current standards in the United States and its continuing success in implementing on-going cost containment and reduction programs. Difficulties, delays or failures experienced in connection with any of these factors could materially affect the future growth of the Company.\nFailure of one or more of our information technology platforms could affect our ability to execute our operating strategy.\nThe Company relies on a variety of information technology platforms to execute its operations, including human resources, payroll, finance, order-to-cash, procurement, vendor payment, inventory management, distribution and content management systems and its internal operating systems. Many of these systems are integrated via internally developed interfaces and modifications. Failure of one or more systems could lead to operating inefficiencies or disruptions and a resulting decline in revenue or profitability. As the Company continues to implement its new enterprise-wide customer and content management systems and the migration to software as a service (\"SaaS\") and cloud-based technology solutions, in its initiatives to integrate its separate legacy platforms into a cohesive enterprise-wide system, there can be no assurance that it will be successful in its efforts or that the staged implementation of these initiatives in the Company's global operations will not involve disruptions in its systems or processes having a short term adverse impact on its operations and ability to service its customers.\nIncreases in certain operating costs and expenses, which are beyond our control and can significantly affect our profitability, could adversely affect our operating performance.\nThe Company\u2019s major expense categories include employee compensation and printing, paper and distribution (such as postage, shipping and fuel) costs. Compensation costs are influenced by general economic factors, including those affecting costs of health insurance, post-retirement benefits and any trends specific to the employee skill sets that the Company requires.\nPaper prices fluctuate based on worldwide demand and supply for paper in general, as well as for the specific types of paper used by the Company. If there is a significant disruption in the supply of paper or a significant increase in paper costs, or in its shipping or fuel costs, beyond those currently anticipated, which would generally be beyond the control of the Company, or if the Company\u2019s strategies to try to manage these costs, including additional cost savings initiatives, are ineffective, the Company\u2019s results of operations could be adversely affected.\nFailure of third party providers to provide contracted outsourcing of business processes and information technology services could cause business interruptions and could increase the costs of these services to the Company.\nThe Company outsources business processes to reduce complexity and increase efficiency for activities such as distribution, manufacturing, product development, transactional processing, information technologies and various administrative functions. Increasingly, the Company is engaging third parties to provide SaaS, which can reduce the\nCompany\u2019s internal execution risk, but increases the Company\u2019s dependency upon third parties to execute business critical information technology tasks. If SaaS providers are unable to provide these services, or if outsource providers fail to execute their contracted functionality, the Company could experience disruptions to its distribution and other business activities and may incur higher costs.\nThe inability to obtain and publish best-selling new titles such as Harry Potter could cause our future results to decline in comparison to historical results.\nThe Company invests in authors and illustrators for its Trade publication business, and has a history of publishing hit titles such as Harry Potter. The inability to publish best-selling new titles in future years could negatively impact the Company.\nThe loss of or failure to obtain rights to intellectual property material to our businesses would adversely affect our financial results.\nThe Company\u2019s products generally comprise intellectual property delivered through a variety of media. The ability to achieve anticipated results depends in part on the Company\u2019s ability to defend its intellectual property against infringement, as well as the breadth of rights obtained. The Company\u2019s operating results could be adversely affected by inadequate legal and technological protections for its intellectual property and proprietary rights in some jurisdictions, markets and media, as well as by the costs of dealing with claims alleging infringement of the intellectual property rights of others, including claims involving business method patents in the ecommerce and internet area, and the Company\u2019s revenues could be constrained by limitations on the rights that the Company is able to secure to exploit its intellectual property in different media and distribution channels, as well as geographic limitations on the exploitation of such rights.\nBecause we sell our products and services in foreign countries, changes in currency exchange rates, as well as other risks and uncertainties, could adversely affect our operations and financial results.\nThe Company has various operating subsidiaries domiciled in foreign countries. In addition, the Company sells products and services to customers located in foreign countries where it does not have operating subsidiaries, and a significant portion of the Company\u2019s revenues are generated from outside of the United States. The Company\u2019s business processes, including distribution, sales, sourcing of content, marketing and advertising, are, accordingly, subject to multiple national, regional and local laws, regulations and policies. The Company could be adversely affected by noncompliance with foreign laws, regulations and policies, including those pertaining to foreign rights and exportation. The Company is also exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and to business disruption caused by political, financial or economic instability or the occurrence of natural disasters in foreign countries. In addition, the Company and its foreign operations could be adversely impacted by a downturn in general economic conditions on a more global basis caused by general political instability or unrest or changes in economic affiliations. For example, the results of the Referendum on the United Kingdom\u2019s (or the UK) Membership in the European Union (EU) (referred to as Brexit), advising for the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union, could affect our sales in the UK, as the uncertainty caused by the vote and the uncertain future course of negotiations between the EU and the UK could negatively impact the economies of the UK and other nations.\nFailure to meet the demands of regulators, and the associated high cost of compliance with regulations, as well as failure to enforce compliance with our Code of Ethics and other policies, could negatively impact us.\nThe Company operates in multiple countries and is subject to different regulations throughout the world. In the United States, the Company is regulated by the Internal Revenue Service, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Trade Commission and other regulating bodies. Failure to comply with these regulators, including providing these regulators with accurate financial and statistical information that often is subject to estimates and assumptions, or the high cost of complying with relevant regulations, could negatively impact the Company.\nIn addition, the decentralized and global nature of the Company\u2019s operations makes it more difficult to communicate and monitor compliance with the Company\u2019s Code of Ethics and other material Company policies and to assure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, some of which have global applicability, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in the United States and the UK Bribery Act in the United Kingdom. Failures to comply with the Company\u2019s Code of Ethics and violations of such laws or regulations, including through employee misconduct, could result in significant liabilities for the Company, including criminal liability, fines and civil litigation risk, and result in damage to the reputation of the Company.\nCertain of our activities are subject to weather risks, which could disrupt our operations or otherwise adversely affect our financial performance.\nThe Company conducts certain of its businesses and maintains warehouse and office facilities in locations that are at risk of being negatively affected by severe weather events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, floods or snowstorms. Notably, much of the Company\u2019s domestic distribution facilities are located in central Missouri. A disruption of these or other facilities could impact the Company\u2019s school-based book clubs, school-based book fairs and education businesses. Additionally, weather disruptions could result in school closures, resulting in reduced demand for the Company\u2019s products in its school channels during the affected periods. Accordingly, the Company could be adversely affected by any future significant weather event.\nControl of the Company resides in our Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer and other members of his family through their ownership of Class A Stock, and the holders of the Common Stock generally have no voting rights with respect to transactions requiring stockholder approval.\nThe voting power of the Corporation\u2019s capital stock is vested exclusively in the holders of Class A Stock, except for the right of the holders of Common Stock to elect one-fifth of the Board of Directors and except as otherwise provided by law or as may be established in favor of any series of preferred stock that may be issued. Richard Robinson, the Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer, and other members of the Robinson family beneficially own all of the outstanding shares of Class A Stock and are able to elect up to four-fifths of the Corporation\u2019s Board of Directors and, without the approval of the Corporation\u2019s other stockholders, to effect or block other actions or transactions requiring stockholder approval, such as a merger, sale of substantially all assets or similar transaction.\nNote\nThe risk factors listed above should not be construed as exhaustive or as any admission regarding the adequacy of disclosures made by the Company prior to and including the date hereof.\nForward-Looking Statements:\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements. Additional written and oral forward-looking statements may be made by the Company from time to time in SEC filings and otherwise.
