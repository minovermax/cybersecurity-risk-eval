RISK FACTORS\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENT RELEVANT TO FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K includes \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. All statements, other than statements of historical fact, in this report, including, without limitation, statements regarding our future financial position, business strategy, budgets, projected revenues, projected costs and plans and objectives of management for future operations, are, or may be deemed to be, forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements involve assumptions, known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the Company, to be materially different from historical earnings and those presently anticipated or projected or any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements contained in this report.\nIn addition, forward-looking statements generally can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as \u201canticipate,\u201d \u201cbelieve,\u201d \u201ccontinue,\u201d \u201ccould,\u201d \u201cestimate,\u201d \u201cexpect,\u201d \u201cforecast,\u201d \u201cgoal,\u201d \u201cintend,\u201d \u201cmay,\u201d \u201cobjective,\u201d \u201cplan,\u201d \u201cpotential,\u201d \u201cpredict,\u201d \u201cproject,\u201d \u201cshould,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201cwill likely,\u201d or similar expressions. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, such expectations may not prove to be correct. We caution you not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. Important factors that could affect our financial performance and that could cause actual results for future periods to differ materially from our expectations include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe supply, demand and market prices of oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nour current and future indebtedness;\n\u2022\nour ability to raise capital to fund our current and future operations;\n\u2022\nour ability to develop oil and gas reserves;\n\u2022\ncompetition from other companies in the energy market;\n\u2022\npolitical instability and foreign government regulations over international operations;\n\u2022\nour lack of diversification of production and reserves;\n\u2022\ncompliance and enforcement of restriction on production and exports;\n\u2022\ncompliance and enforcement of environmental laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nour ability to achieve profitability;\n\u2022\nour dependency on third parties to enable us to produce and deliver oil and gas; and\n\u2022\nother factors disclosed under Item 1. Description of Business, Item 1A. Risk Factors, Item 2. Properties, Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk and elsewhere in this report.\nWe have based our forward-looking statements on our management\u2019s beliefs and assumptions based on information available to our management at the time the statements are made. We caution you that assumptions, beliefs, expectations, intentions and projections about future events may and often do vary materially from actual results. Therefore, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements. You should consider carefully the statements under the\n\u201cRisk Factors\u201d section of this report and other sections of this report which describe factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements, and the following factors:\n\u2022\nthe possibility that our future acquisitions may involve unexpected costs;\n\u2022\nthe volatility in commodity prices for oil and gas;\n\u2022\nthe accuracy of internally estimated proved reserves;\n\u2022\nthe presence or recoverability of estimated oil and gas reserves;\n\u2022\nthe ability to replace oil and gas reserves;\n\u2022\nthe availability and costs of drilling rigs and other oilfield services;\n\u2022\nrisks inherent in natural gas and oil drilling and production activities, including risks of fire, explosion, blowouts, pipe failure, casing collapse, unusual or unexpected formation pressures, environmental hazards, and other operating and production risks;\n\u2022\ndelays in receipt of drilling permits;\n\u2022\nrisks relating to the availability of capital to fund drilling operations that can be adversely affected by adverse drilling results, production declines and declines in natural gas and oil prices;\n\u2022\nrisks relating to unexpected adverse developments in the status of properties;\n\u2022\nrisks relating to the absence or delay in receipt of government approvals or other third party consents;\n\u2022\nenvironmental risks;\n\u2022\nexploration and development risks;\n\u2022\ncompetition;\n\u2022\nthe inability to realize expected value from acquisitions;\n\u2022\nthe availability and cost of alternative fuel sources;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain the listing of our common stock on the NYSE American;\n\u2022\nour ability to meet the covenants in our loan agreements and the consequences of not meeting such covenants;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our management team to execute its plans to meet its goals; and\n\u2022\nother economic, competitive, governmental, legislative, regulatory, geopolitical and technological factors that may negatively impact our businesses, operations and pricing.\nShould one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual outcomes may vary materially from those indicated. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by reference to these risks and uncertainties. You should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of the particular statement, and, except as required by law, we undertake no duty to update or revise any forward-looking statement.\nFor a detailed description of these and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statement, please see \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in Item 1A of Part I of this report and in other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Business\nWe have substantial indebtedness and may incur substantially more debt. Higher levels of indebtedness make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our business.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $65.6 million outstanding under the Mauritius Commercial Bank Limited (\"MCB\") Finance Facility, $11.7 million outstanding under the James Street Capital Partners Limited, (\"JSC\") Note, $50.0 million outstanding in aggregate principal under the 2014 Convertible Subordinated Note, $48.5 million, net of discount, under our borrowing facility with Allied in the form of a convertible note (the \"2015 Convertible Note\"), $78.0 million, net of discount, under our credit facility (the \"Term Loan Facility\") with Zenith Bank PLC (\"Zenith\"), $24.9 million under our borrowing facility with Allied in the form of a promissory note (the \"2011 Promissory Note\"), and $6.4 million under a Promissory Note agreement entered into with an entity related to the Company's majority shareholder (the \"2016 Promissory Note\") and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future. Our level of indebtedness has, or could have, important consequences to our business because:\n\u2022\na substantial portion of our cash flows from operations will be dedicated to interest and principal payments and may not be available for operations, working capital, capital expenditures, expansion, acquisitions, general corporate or other purposes;\n\u2022\nit may impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for acquisitions, capital expenditures or general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nit may limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry; and\n\u2022\nwe may be substantially more leveraged than some of our competitors, which may place us at a relative competitive disadvantage and make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business, our industry or the economy in general.\nIn addition, the terms of the Term Loan Facility and the MCB Finance Facility restrict, and the terms of any future indebtedness including any future credit facility may restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness and grant liens because of debt or financial covenants we are, or may be, required to meet. Thus, we may not be able to obtain sufficient capital to grow our business or implement our business strategy and may lose opportunities to acquire interests in oil properties or related businesses because of our inability to fund such growth.\nOur ability to comply with restrictions and covenants, including those in the Term Loan Facility, the MCB Finance Facility or in any future credit facility, is uncertain and will be affected by the levels of cash flow from our operations and events or circumstances beyond our control. Our failure to comply with any of the restrictions and covenants in the Term Loan Facility and the MCB Finance Facility could result in a default, which could permit the lenders to accelerate repayments and foreclose on the collateral securing such indebtedness.\nEvents of default may occur under our outstanding promissory notes, credit agreements and financing agreements. If events of default occur or such holders of our indebtedness accelerate the repayment obligations thereunder as to matters not covered or no longer covered by the waivers, we may be forced to repay the obligations that become immediately due, which funds may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.\nAllied, a related party, was the holder of each of the 2011 Promissory Note, the 2014 Convertible Subordinated Note, and the 2015 Convertible Note (collectively the \"Related Party Notes\"). In April 2017, Oltasho became the holder of each of the Related Party Notes. Each of the Related Party Notes contain certain default and cross-default provisions, including failure to pay interest and principal amounts when due and default under other indebtedness. As of December 31, 2017, the Company was not in compliance with certain default provisions of the Related Party Notes with respect to the payment of quarterly interest. Further, the risk of cross-default exists for each of the Related Party Notes if the holder of the Term Loan Facility exercises its right to terminate the Term Loan Facility and accelerate its maturity. In July 2017, Oltasho agreed to waive through their respective maturity dates its rights under all default provisions of each of the Related Party Notes.\nFor additional information regarding defaults, cross-defaults and potential cross-defaults, please see the discussion regarding each debt instrument in Note 8 - Debt to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included herein. If any of our debt obligations are accelerated due to the events of default or future events of default or cross-defaults, we may not be able to repay the obligations that become immediately due and will have severe liquidity restraints.\nDue to our lack of liquidity, we may not be able to make the required principal and interest payments under the Term Loan Facility, the MCB Facility and other indebtedness or to satisfy our obligations under our trade payables.\nAs a result of the current low commodity prices and a prior history of low oil production volumes due to the shut-in of well Oyo-8 from September 2015 to May 2016 and the currently shut-in well Oyo 7, the Company has not been able to generate sufficient cash from operations to satisfy certain obligations as they become due. The Company has been relying on drawdowns under the MCB Finance Facility and short-term promissory notes, such as the 2016 Promissory Note, with an entity related to the Company\u2019s then majority shareholder which notes have been foreclosed on and transferred to an unrelated party to supplement the Company\u2019s liquidity needs, but we may not be able to continue to borrow funds under the MCB Facility in the future or the related party may not continue to provide such short-term loans in the future.\nPursuant to the Term Loan Facility, Zenith has the right to review the terms and conditions of the Term Loan Facility.\nThe Company did not make the principal payment due and a portion of interest due on December 31, 2017. Also, on June 27, 2017, a vendor filed a suit against a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company seeking an amount in excess of $10.0 million (see Note 10 - Commitments and Contingencies for further information). These constitute events of default under the MCB Finance Facility. The Company is currently in discussions with MCB on a revised principal repayment schedule. Our failure to make the required payments under the MCB Facility or the Term Loan Facility, or to comply with its applicable debt covenants could result in a default under the applicable facility and a cross-default under the other facility and the Related Party Notes\n(defined and described above under \u201cNote 8 - Debt - Long-Term Debt - Related Party\u201d, from the notes to the unaudited consolidated financial statements set forth under \u201cPart IV Exhibits, Financial Statements and Schedules\u201d - \u201cItem 15 - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d), which could result in the acceleration of the payment of such indebtedness, termination of commitments to make further loans to us, prevention of our development drilling on the Oyo field and other operations, loss of our ownership interests in the secured properties or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Also, if we are unable to service our debt obligations or obligations under our trade payables generally, Company may be unable to continue in its current state or continue to operate as a going concern.\nWe have potential significant liability associated with penalty and interest related to outstanding transactional tax obligations in Nigeria, which we have not accrued as of the date of this report.\nOur operations and assets in Nigeria subject us to various Nigerian tax obligations, including the obligation to withhold taxes and pay value-added taxes, Nigerian Oil and Gas Industry Content Development Act (NCD) taxes, Cabotage (transportation) taxes, and Niger Delta Development Corporation taxes (NDDC). As of the date of this report, we have not accrued penalty and interest thereon; however, we believe that, based on our experience with local practices in Nigeria, the likelihood of being assessed penalty and interest is reasonably possible, with an estimated liability up to $27.4 million. As described above, this amount has not been accrued and is not included as a liability in the attached consolidated financial statements and in the event we are required to pay that amount, a significant portion thereof, or an amount greater than our estimates, it could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and liquidity and could cause the value of our securities to decline in value. Furthermore, the amount of assets and liabilities shown in the attached consolidated financial statements and our working capital associated therewith, would be materially different if such attached consolidated financial statements included an accrual for the amounts described above.\nWe owe certain obligations which are secured by a security interest in substantially all of our assets.\nThe stock of the Company\u2019s subsidiary that holds the exploration licenses in The Gambia were pledged as collateral to secure the 2011 Promissory Note, pursuant to an Equitable Share Mortgage arrangement. Our senior lenders and note holders also hold security interests over certain other of our material assets. If an event of default occurs under our secured indebtedness, the holders of such indebtedness may enforce their security interests over our assets which secure the repayment of such obligations, and we could be forced to curtail or abandon our current business plans and operations. If that were to happen, any investment in us could become worthless.\nWe may be unable to continue as a going concern.\nThe Company has incurred losses from operations in each of the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. As of December 31, 2017, the Company's total current liabilities of $398.3 million exceeded its total current assets of $51.3 million, resulting in a working capital deficit of $347.0 million. Additionally, as mentioned in the risk factors above, we have substantial debt obligations and may not be able to maintain adequate liquidity throughout 2018. As a result, the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been prepared under the assumption that it will continue as a going concern, which assumes the continuity of operations, the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities as they come due in the normal course of business. Our consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Although the Company believes that it will be able to generate sufficient liquidity, its current circumstances raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue to operate as a going concern. If we become unable to continue as a going concern, we may have to liquidate our assets, and the values we receive for our assets in liquidation or dissolution could be significantly lower than the values reflected in our financial statements.\nWe may not be able to generate or obtain sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness or trade payables, and we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness and trade payables, which may not be successful.\nWe may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or to obtain alternative sources of financing in an amount sufficient to fund our liquidity needs or on favorable terms. Our operating cash inflows are typically used for capital expenditures, operating expenses, debt service costs and working capital needs.\nAs a result of the current low commodity prices and the Company\u2019s low oil production volumes due to the shut-in of well Oyo-8 from September 2015 to May 2016 and the currently shut-in well Oyo 7, we have experienced a reduction in our available liquidity and we may not have the ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations and, therefore, sufficient liquidity to meet our anticipated working capital, debt service and other liquidity needs. As of December 31, 2017, we had available\nunrestricted cash of approximately $22.1 million and total current assets of approximately $51.3 million. Conversely, we had total current liabilities of $398.3 million, of which $277.4 million is accounts payable and accrued liabilities. Based upon the current commodity prices, we do not expect our cash flow from operations to be sufficient to repay our indebtedness or trade payables in the near term. We are currently evaluating strategic alternatives to address our liquidity issues and high debt levels. These efforts include, among others, i) obtaining additional funds from public or private financing sources, ii) restructuring existing debts from lenders, iii) obtaining forbearance of debt from trade creditors, iv) reducing ongoing operating costs, v) minimizing projected capital costs for the 2018 exploration and development campaign, vi) farming-out a portion of our rights to certain of our oil and gas properties, and vii) exploring potential business combination transactions. Sufficient liquidity may not be able to be raised from one or more of these actions and these actions may not be consummated within the period needed to meet future obligations.\nWe will continue to evaluate our ability to make debt payments in light of our liquidity constraints as we continue to explore various strategic initiatives. Any failure to make future principal or interest payments on our indebtedness or to cure any payment default within any applicable grace period may result in an event of default under the applicable debt agreement or instrument. As a result, if we are unable to service our debt obligations generally, and if we are unable to successfully refinance our debt obligations or effect a similar alternative transaction, the Company may not be able to continue in its current state and any investment in the Company may not retain any value.\nOur business operations require substantial additional capital. If we are unable to raise additional capital on acceptable terms in the future, our ability to execute our business plan may be impaired.\nThe Company\u2019s business operations require substantial capital from outside sources as well as from internally-generated sources. Although our majority shareholder has historically provided the Company with additional funding in the past, our majority shareholder may not provide any funds in the future or, if the funds are provided, the terms under which the funds are provided may not be favorable or acceptable to us. The Company\u2019s ability to finance a portion of its working capital and capital expenditure requirements with cash flow from operations will be subject to a number of variables, such as:\n\u2022\nthe level of production from existing and new wells;\n\u2022\nthe prices of oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nthe success and timing of the development of proved undeveloped reserves;\n\u2022\nremedial work undertaken to improve our well\u2019s producing capability;\n\u2022\nthe direct costs and general and administrative expenses of operations;\n\u2022\nreserves, including a reserve for the estimated costs of eventually plugging and abandoning our wells;\n\u2022\nindemnification obligations of the Company for losses or liabilities incurred in connection with the Company\u2019s activities;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond the Company\u2019s control; and\n\u2022\nour ability to farm-out portions of the Company\u2019s rights under its various petroleum licenses.\nThe significant decline in oil and natural gas prices as well as our substantial indebtedness and general lack of liquidity may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional financing. The Company might not generate or sustain cash flows at sufficient levels to finance its business activities. When and if the Company generates significant revenues, if such revenues were to decrease due to lower oil prices, decreased production or other factors, and if the Company were unable to obtain capital through reasonable financing arrangements, its ability to execute its business plan would be limited, and it could be required to discontinue operations.\nThe Company may continue to incur losses for a significant period of time and may not be able to achieve profitability.\nIn addition to our interests in the OMLs, including the Oyo field, we have signed production sharing contracts in Kenya, two exploration licenses in The Gambia and a petroleum agreement in Ghana. As we are still in the early stages of exploration and have yet to drill on our Gambian, and Ghanaian blocks, we expect to continue to incur significant expenses relating to our identification of drilling prospects and investment costs relating to exploration activities in the foreseeable future. Additionally, fixed commitments, including salaries and fees for employees and consultants, rent and other contractual commitments may be substantial and are likely to increase as exploration drilling is scheduled and personnel are retained. Drilling projects generally require a significant period of time before they produce resources and generate profits. Our production in the Oyo field may or may not result in net earnings in excess of our losses on other ventures under development or in the start-up phase. We may not achieve or sustain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis, or at all.\nThe geographic concentration of our properties offshore Nigeria, The Gambia and Ghana subjects us to an increased risk of loss of revenue or curtailment of production from factors specifically affecting offshore Nigeria, The Gambia and Ghana.\nOur properties are concentrated in three countries: Nigeria, The Gambia and Ghana, and all of the value of our production and reserves is concentrated in a single oilfield offshore Nigeria. Any failure to sustain production, production problems or reduction in reserve estimates related to the Oyo field would adversely impact our business. In addition, some or all of these properties could be affected should such regions experience:\n\u2022\nsevere weather or natural disasters;\n\u2022\nmoratoria on drilling or permitting delays;\n\u2022\ndelays in or the inability to obtain regulatory approvals;\n\u2022\ndelays or decreases in production;\n\u2022\ndelays or decreases in the availability of drilling rigs and related equipment, facilities, personnel or services;\n\u2022\ndelays or decreases in the availability of the capacity to transport, gather or process production; and/or\n\u2022\nchanges in the regulatory, political and fiscal environments.\nWe maintain insurance coverage for only a portion of these risks. There also may be certain risks covered by insurance where the policy does not reimburse us for all of the costs related to a loss. We do not carry business interruption insurance.\nDue to the concentrated nature of our portfolio of properties, a number of our properties could experience any of the same conditions at the same time, resulting in a relatively greater impact on our results of operations than they might have on other companies that have a more diversified portfolio of properties.\nThe loss of key employees could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to operate.\nThe Company believes that its success depends on the continued service of its key employees, as well as the Company\u2019s ability to hire additional key employees, as needed. Each of the Company\u2019s key employees has the right to terminate his/her employment at any time without penalty under his/her employment agreement. The unexpected loss of the services of any of these key employees, or the Company\u2019s failure to find suitable replacements within a reasonable period of time thereafter, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s ability to execute its business plan and, therefore, on its financial condition and results of operations.\nOur failure to effectively execute our exploration and development projects could result in significant delays and/or cost over-runs, including the delay of any future production, which could negatively impact our operating results, liquidity and financial position.\nWe currently have a number of exploration projects, all of which are in the early stages of the project development life-cycle, in addition to our Oyo field development project. Our exploration projects will require substantial additional evaluation and analysis, including drilling and, in the event a commercial discovery occurs, the expenditure of substantial amounts of capital, prior to preparing a development plan and seeking formal project sanction. First production from these exploration projects, in the event a discovery is made, is not expected for several years. Our Oyo field development project and some of our exploration projects are located in challenging deepwater environments and may entail significant technical challenges, including subsea tiebacks to a floating, production, storage and offloading vessel or production platform, pressure maintenance systems, gas re-injection systems, and other specialized infrastructure.\nThis level of development activity and complexity requires significant effort from our management and technical personnel and places additional requirements on our financial resources and internal financial controls. In addition, we have increased dependency on third-party technology and service providers and other supply chain participants for these complex projects. We may not be able to fully execute these projects due to:\n\u2022\nour inability to obtain sufficient and timely financing;\n\u2022\nour inability to attract and/or retain a sufficient quantity of personnel with the skills required to bring these complex projects to production on schedule and on budget;\n\u2022\nsignificant delays in the delivery of essential items or performance of services, cost overruns, supplier insolvency, or other critical supply failure could adversely affect project development;\n\u2022\nlack of partner or government approval for projects;\n\u2022\ncivil disturbances, anti-development activities, legal challenges or other interruptions which could prevent access; and\n\u2022\ndrilling hazards or accidents or natural disasters.\nWe may not be able to compensate for, or fully mitigate, these risks.\nThe Company\u2019s failure to capitalize on existing petroleum agreements could result in an inability by the Company to generate sufficient revenues and continue operations.\nThe Company has a 100% economic interest in, and operatorship of, the OMLs in Nigeria, including the Oyo field. The Company has also entered into definitive petroleum agreements with Kenya, The Gambia, and Ghana. The Company\u2019s business strategy includes spreading the risk of oil and natural gas exploration, development and drilling, and ownership of interests in oil and natural gas properties by participating in multiple projects and joint ventures. Failure by the Company to capitalize on its existing contracts could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nUnder the terms of our various petroleum agreements and leases, we are required to drill wells, declare any discoveries, conduct certain development activities and make certain payments in order to retain exploration and production rights, and our failure to do so may result in substantial license renewal costs or penalties or loss of our interests in the undeveloped parts of our license areas.\nIn order to protect our exploration and production rights in our license areas, we must meet various drilling, declaration and payment requirements. In general, unless we make and declare discoveries within certain time periods specified in our various petroleum agreements and leases, our interests in the undeveloped parts of our license areas may lapse and we may be subject to significant penalties or be required to make additional payments in order to maintain such licenses. We may not receive an extension of the relevant exploration periods for any of our prospects and the terms of the extensions may be on unfavorable terms. Additionally, these agreements require us to make certain payments, including royalty payments, training fee payments and other payments, to our counterparties. A failure to make such payments, even if subject to dispute, may result in significant penalties being imposed on us and the possible loss of exploration and production rights under the applicable agreement. Such penalties and losses of rights could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur proved reserves are based on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. Any significant inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions could materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves. Of our total estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2017, 7.1 million Bbls may ultimately be less than currently estimated.\nThe process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex. It requires interpretations of available technical data and many assumptions, including assumptions relating to current and future economic conditions and commodity prices. Any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantities. In the case of production sharing contracts, the quantities allocable to a part-interest owner\u2019s share are affected by the assumptions of that owner\u2019s future participation in funding of operating and capital costs. Actual future production, prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves will vary from estimates. Any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves disclosed. In addition, estimates of proved reserves reflect production history, results of exploration and development, prevailing prices and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Due to the limited production history, the estimates of future production associated with such properties may be subject to greater variance to actual production than would be the case with properties having a longer production history.\nOur exploration projects remain subject to varying degrees of additional evaluation, analysis and partner and regulatory approvals prior to official project sanction and production.\nA discovery made by the initial exploration well on a prospect does not ensure that we will ultimately develop or produce hydrocarbons from such prospect or that a development project will be economically viable or successful. Following a discovery by an initial exploration well, substantial additional evaluation, analysis, expenditure of capital and partner and regulatory approvals will need to be performed and obtained prior to official project sanction and development, which may include (i) the drilling of appraisal wells, (ii) the evaluation and analysis of well logs, reservoir core samples, fluid samples and the results of production tests from both exploration and appraisal wells, and (iii) the preparation of a development plan which includes economic assumptions on future oil and gas prices, the costs of drilling development wells, and the construction or leasing of offshore production facilities and transportation infrastructure. Regulatory approvals are also required to proceed with certain development plans.\nAny of the foregoing steps of evaluation and analysis may render a particular development project uneconomic, and we may ultimately decide to abandon the project, despite the fact that the initial exploration well, or subsequent appraisal or development wells, discovered hydrocarbons. We may also decide to abandon a project based on forecasted oil and gas prices or the inability to obtain sufficient financing. We may not be successful in obtaining partner or regulatory approvals to develop a particular discovery, which could prevent us from proceeding with development and ultimately producing hydrocarbons from such discovery, even if we believe a development would be economically successful.\nOur current operations are subject to, and our future operations will be subject to, climate change and greenhouse gas restrictions.\nDue to concern over the risk of climate change, a number of countries have adopted, or are considering the adoption of, regulatory frameworks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These include adoption of cap and trade regimes, carbon taxes, restrictive permitting, increased efficiency standards, and incentives or mandates for renewable energy. These requirements could make our products more expensive, lengthen project implementation times, and reduce demand for hydrocarbons, as well as shift hydrocarbon demand toward relatively lower-carbon sources such as natural gas. Current and pending greenhouse gas regulations may also increase our compliance costs, such as for monitoring or sequestering emissions.\nThe Company\u2019s oil and gas operations are subject to various risks beyond the Company\u2019s control.\nThe Company expects to produce, transport and market potentially toxic materials and purchase, handle and dispose of other potentially toxic materials in the course of its business. The Company\u2019s operations will produce byproducts, which may be considered pollutants. Any of these activities could result in liability, either as a result of an accidental, unlawful discharge or as a result of new findings on the effects of the Company\u2019s operations on human health or the environment. Additionally, the Company\u2019s oil and gas operations may also involve one or more of the following risks:\n\u2022\nfires and explosions;\n\u2022\nblow-outs and oil spills;\n\u2022\npipe or cement failures and casing collapses;\n\u2022\nuncontrollable flows of oil, gas, formation water, or drilling fluids;\n\u2022\nembedded oilfield drilling and services tools;\n\u2022\nabnormally pressured formations;\n\u2022\nnatural disaster;\n\u2022\nvandalism and terrorism; and\n\u2022\nenvironmental hazards.\nIn the event that any of the foregoing events occur, the Company could incur substantial losses that may not be covered by insurance or that may exceed our insurable limits as a result of (i) injury or loss of life; (ii) severe damage or destruction of property, natural resources or equipment; (iii) pollution and other environmental damage; (iv) investigatory and clean-up responsibilities; (v) regulatory investigation and penalties; (vi) suspension of its operations; or (vii) repairs to resume operations. If the Company experiences any of these problems, its ability to conduct operations could be adversely affected. Additionally, offshore operations are subject to a variety of risks, such as capsizing, collisions and damage or loss from typhoons or other adverse weather conditions. These conditions could cause substantial damage to facilities and interrupt production.\nThe Company is dependent on others for the storage and transportation of all of its oil and gas which could result in significant operational costs to the Company and depletion of capital and may expose us to financial loss and reputation harm.\nThe Company does not own any storage or transportation facilities and, therefore, will depend upon third parties to store and transport all of its oil and gas resources when and if produced. The Company will likely be subject to price changes and termination provisions in any contracts it may enter into with these third-party service providers. The Company may not be able to identify such third parties for any particular project. Even if such sources are initially identified, the Company may not be able to identify alternative storage and transportation providers in the event of contract price increases or termination. In the event the Company is unable to find acceptable third-party service providers, it would be required to contract for its own storage facilities and employees to transport the Company\u2019s resources. The Company may not have sufficient capital available to assume these obligations, and its inability to do so could result in the cessation of its business.\nAdditionally, our oil and gas transportation involve marine, land and pipeline transportation, which are subject to hazards such as capsizing, collision, acts of piracy and damage or loss from severe weather conditions, explosions, oil and gas spills and leakages. These hazards could result in serious personal injury or loss of human life, significant damage to property and equipment, environmental pollution, impairment of operations, risk of financial loss and reputation harm. We may not be insured against all of these risks and uninsured losses and liabilities arising from these hazards could reduce the funds available to us for financing, exploration and investment, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDrilling wells is speculative, often involving significant costs that may be greater than our estimates and may not result in any discoveries or additions to our future production or reserves. Any material inaccuracies in drilling costs, estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect our business.\nExploring for and developing oil reserves involves a high degree of operational and financial risk, which precludes definitive statements as to the time required and costs involved in reaching certain objectives. The budgeted costs of drilling, completing and operating exploration, appraisal and development wells are often exceeded and can increase significantly when drilling costs rise due to a tightening in the supply of various types of oilfield equipment and related services. Drilling may be unsuccessful for many reasons, including geological conditions, weather, cost overruns, equipment shortages and mechanical difficulties. Exploration wells bear a much greater risk of financial loss than development wells. In the past, we have experienced unsuccessful drilling efforts. Moreover, the successful drilling of an oil well does not necessarily result in a profit on investment. A variety of factors, both geological and market-related, can cause a well or an entire development project to become uneconomic or only marginally economic. Our initial drilling sites, and any potential additional sites that may be developed, require significant additional exploration and appraisal, regulatory approval and commitments of resources prior to commercial development. We face additional risks due to i) a general lack of infrastructure in areas in which we operate, ii) underdeveloped oil and gas industries in areas in which we operate, and iii) increased transportation expenses due to geographic remoteness. Thus, this may require either a single well to be exceptionally productive, or the existence of multiple successful wells, to allow for the development of a commercially viable field and/or for our exploration activities to be profitable. If our actual drilling and development costs are significantly more than our estimated costs, we may not be able to continue our business operations as proposed and would be forced to modify our plan of operation.\nWe contract with third parties to conduct drilling and related services on our development and exploration prospects for us. Such third parties may not perform the services they provide us on schedule or within budget. The decline in oil and gas prices may have an adverse impact on certain third parties from which we contract drilling, development and related oilfield services, which in turn could affect such companies' ability to perform such services for us and result in delays to our exploration, appraisal and development activities. Furthermore, the drilling equipment, facilities and infrastructure owned and operated by the third parties we contract with are highly complex and subject to malfunction and breakdown. Any malfunctions or breakdowns may be outside our control and may result in delays, which could be substantial. Any delays in our drilling campaign caused by equipment, facility or equipment malfunction or breakdown could materially increase our costs of drilling and cause an adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nAn interruption in the supply of materials, resources or services, including storage and transportation of oil and gas, could limit the Company\u2019s operations and cause unprofitability.\nThe Company obtains, and will need to obtain in the future, materials, resources and services, including, but not limited to, specialized chemicals, specialty muds, drilling fluids, pipe, drill-string and geological and geophysical mapping and interpretation services to carry out its operations. There may be only a limited number of manufacturers and suppliers of these materials, resources and services. Additionally, these manufacturers and suppliers may experience difficulty in supplying such materials, resources and services to the Company sufficient to meet its needs or may terminate or fail to renew contracts for supplying these materials, resources or services on terms the Company finds acceptable including, without limitation, acceptable pricing terms.\nThe Company does not presently carry business interruption insurance policies in Africa and will be at risk of incurring business interruption loss due to political unrest, theft, accidents or natural disasters.\nThe Company does not presently carry any policies of insurance in Africa to help protect itself from interruptions to its business. In the event that the Company were to incur business interruption losses with respect to one or more incidents, this could adversely affect its operations, and it may not have the necessary capital to maintain business operations.\nOur business partner, CEHL, is a related party, and our former executive chairman and former CEO is a principal owner and one of the directors of CEHL, which may result in real or perceived conflicts of interest.\nDr. Lawal, the Company\u2019s former Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors and former Chief Executive Officer, who retired from the Company in May 2016, is a director of each of CEHL and Allied, entities constituting the CEHL Group. Further, Dr. Lawal owns 27.7% of CAMAC International Limited, which indirectly owns 100% of CEHL. Allied is a wholly-owned subsidiary of CEHL. The holder of our 2016 Promissory Note is a subsidiary of CAMAC International Limited. As a result, Dr. Lawal may be deemed to have an indirect material interest in any transactions with CEHL including the agreements entered into with CEHL in April 2010, the OMLs transaction, the 2011 Promissory Note, the 2014 Convertible Subordinated Note, the 2015 Convertible Note, each of which promissory notes were subsequently assigned to Oltasho, and the 2016 Promissory Note (see Note 8. - Debt to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the 2011 Promissory Note, the 2014 Convertible Subordinated Note and the 2015 Convertible Note, and the 2016 Promissory Note) and the Transfer Agreement with Allied. These relationships may result in conflicts of interest. Although processes and procedures are in place within the Company to guard against such potential conflicts of interest, we may not be able to prove that these agreements are equivalent to arm\u2019s length transactions. Should our transactions not provide the value equivalent of arm\u2019s length transactions or there is a perception in the market place that conflicts of interest exist, our results of operations may suffer, our stock price may decline in value and we may be subject to costly shareholder litigation.\nIf CEHL, our former majority shareholder, is unable to retain and hold rights to a production sharing contract, which we have previously been provided the rights to, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and the value of our securities.\nIn November 2013, we entered into a Transfer Agreement with certain parties including CEHL, our former majority shareholder, pursuant to which, among other things, we agreed to acquire Allied\u2019s remaining economic interests in a production sharing contract (the \u201cPSC\u201d) pertaining to the OMLs located offshore Nigeria (which were later assigned from Allied to CEHL). The Transfer Agreement provided that if Allied/CEHL could not assign any of its rights, title or interest in the PSC and/or certain other contracts agreed to be transferred to the Company pursuant to the Transfer Agreement, to the Company, that Allied/CEHL, would retain and hold such right, title and interest for the benefit of the Company. To date, the PSC and various agreements associated therewith, have not been formally assigned to the Company and are held by CEHL for the Company\u2019s benefit. Because the Company has no control over CEHL\u2019s compliance with the terms of such agreements, and/or its ability to retain the rights thereunder, CEHL, and therefore the Company, may lose the rights to such agreements and/or the benefits therefrom. The loss of the rights or benefits of the PSC and related agreements would have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition and could cause the value of the Company\u2019s securities to decline in value or become worthless.\nApplicable Nigerian income tax rates could adversely affect the value of the OMLs, including the Oyo field.\nIncome derived from our contractual interests in the Oyo field, and EPNL, as acquiring subsidiary in the transactions through which we obtained these contractual interests, are subject to the jurisdiction of the Nigerian taxing authorities. The Nigerian government applies different petroleum profit tax rates upon income derived from Nigerian oil operations ranging from 50% to 85% based on a number of factors. The final determination of the tax liabilities with respect to the OMLs involves the interpretation of local tax laws and related authorities. In addition, changes in the operating environment, including changes in tax law and currency/repatriation controls, could impact the determination of tax liabilities with respect to the OMLs for a tax year. While we believe the petroleum profit tax rate applicable to the OMLs is 50%, the actual applicable rate could be higher, which could result in a material decrease in the profits allocable to the Company under the OMLs.\nThe passage into law of the Nigerian Petroleum Industry Bill could create additional fiscal and regulatory burdens on the parties to the OMLs, which could have a material adverse effect on the profitability of the production.\nA Petroleum Industry Bill (\u201cPIB\u201d) is currently undergoing legislative review at the Nigerian National Assembly. The draft PIB seeks to introduce significant changes to legislation governing the oil and gas sector in Nigeria, including new fiscal regulatory and tax obligations and expanded fiscal and regulatory oversight that may impose additional operational and regulatory burdens on the Company and impact the economic benefits anticipated by the Company. Any such fiscal and regulatory changes could have a negative impact on the profits allocable to the Company under the OMLs.\nThe Oyo field is subject to the volatility of the Nigerian Government.\nThe government of Nigeria has historically experienced volatility, which is out of management\u2019s control. The Company\u2019s ability to exploit its interests in Nigeria may be adversely impacted by unanticipated governmental action. The future success of the Company\u2019s Oyo field interest may also be adversely affected by risks associated with international activities, including economic and labor conditions, political instability, risk of war, expropriation, repatriation, termination, renegotiation or modification of existing contracts, tax laws (including host-country import-export, excise and income taxes and United States taxes on foreign subsidiaries) and changes in the value of the U.S. dollar versus the local currencies in which future oil and gas producing activities may be denominated. Changes in exchange rates may also adversely affect the Company\u2019s future results of operations and financial condition. Realization of any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe OMLs are located in an area where there are high security risks which could result in harm to the Oyo field operations, our employees and contractors and our interest in the Oyo field and the remainder of the OMLs.\nThere are risks inherent to oil production in Nigeria. The Oyo field is located approximately 75 kilometers (46 miles) off the Nigerian coast in deep water. Despite undertaking various security measures and being situated 75 kilometers offshore the Nigerian coast, the FPSO vessel currently being used for storing petroleum production in the Oyo field may become subject to terrorist acts and other acts of hostility like piracy. Such actions could adversely impact our overall business, financial condition and operations. Our facilities, employees and contractors are subject to these substantial security risks and our financial condition and results of operations may materially suffer as a result. Terrorist acts and regional hostilities around the world in recent years have led to increases in insurance premium rates and the implementation of special \u201cwar risk\u201d premiums for certain areas. Such increases in insurance rates may adversely affect our profitability with respect to the Oyo field asset. Moreover, we operate in a sector of the economy that is likely to be adversely impacted by the effects of political instability, terrorist or other attacks, war or international hostilities.\nMaritime disasters and other operational risks may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe operation of the FPSO vessel has an inherent risk of maritime disaster, environmental mishaps, cargo and property losses or damage and business interruptions caused by, among others:\n\u2022\nmechanical failure and dry dock repairs;\n\u2022\nvessel off-hire periods and labor strikes;\n\u2022\nhuman error and adverse weather; and\n\u2022\npolitical action, civil conflict, terrorism and piracy on the way to the operation site, in the vessel's home country or operation site or to the vessel's supply.\nAny of these circumstances could adversely affect the operation of the FPSO vessel and result in loss of revenues or increased costs and adversely affect our revenues and prospects.\nThe threat and impact of terrorist attacks, cyber attacks or similar hostilities may adversely impact our operations.\nWe cannot assess the extent of either the threat or the potential impact of future terrorist attacks on the energy industry in general, and on us in particular, either in the short-term or in the long-term. Uncertainty surrounding such hostilities may affect our operations in unpredictable ways, including the possibility that infrastructure facilities, including pipelines and gathering systems, production facilities, drilling rigs, processing plants and refineries, could be targets of, or indirect casualties of, an act of terror, a cyber attack or electronic security breach, or an act of war.\nUnless we replace our oil and natural gas reserves, our reserves and production will decline, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe rate of production from our oil and natural gas properties will decline as our reserves are depleted. Our future oil and natural gas reserves and production and, therefore, our income and cash flow, are highly dependent on our success in (a) efficiently developing and exploiting our current reserves on properties owned by us or by other persons or entities, and (b) economically finding or acquiring additional oil and natural gas producing properties. In the future, we may have difficulty acquiring new properties. During periods of low oil and/or natural gas prices, it will become more difficult to raise the capital necessary to finance expansion activities. If we are unable to replace our production, our reserves will decrease, and our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nWe may purchase oil and natural gas properties with liabilities or risks that we did not know about or that we did not assess correctly, and, as a result, we could be subject to liabilities that could adversely affect our results of operations.\nBefore acquiring oil and natural gas properties, we estimate the reserves, future oil and natural gas prices, operating costs, potential environmental liabilities and other factors relating to the properties. However, our review involves many assumptions and estimates, and their accuracy is inherently uncertain. As a result, we may not discover all existing or potential problems associated with the properties we buy. We may not become sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess fully their deficiencies and capabilities. We do not generally perform inspections on every property, and we may not be able to observe environmental problems even when we conduct an inspection. The seller may not be willing or financially able to give us contractual protection against any identified problems, and we may decide to assume environmental and other liabilities in connection with properties we acquire. If we acquire properties with risks or liabilities we did not know about or that we did not assess correctly, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected as we settle claims and incur cleanup costs related to these liabilities.\nWe may incur losses or costs as a result of title deficiencies in the properties in which we invest.\nIf an examination of the title history of a property that we have purchased reveals an oil and natural gas lease has been purchased in error from a person who is not the owner of the property, our interest would be worthless. In such an instance, the amount paid for such oil and natural gas lease as well as any royalties paid pursuant to the terms of the lease prior to the discovery of the title defect would be lost. In the future, we may suffer a monetary loss from title defects or title failure. Additionally, unproved and unevaluated acreage has greater risk of title defects than developed acreage. If there are any title defects or defects in assignment of leasehold rights in properties in which we hold an interest, we will suffer a financial loss which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe calculated present value of future net revenues from our proved reserves will not necessarily be the same as the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves.\nYou should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows as included in our public filings is the current market value of our estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves. We generally base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves on current costs held constant over time without escalation and on commodity prices using an unweighted arithmetic average of first-day-of-the-month index prices, appropriately adjusted, for the 12-month period immediately preceding the date of the estimate. Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs used for these estimates and will be affected by factors such as:\n\u2022\nactual prices we receive for oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nactual cost and timing of development and production expenditures;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of actual production; and\n\u2022\nchanges in governmental regulations or taxation.\nIn addition, the 10% discount factor that is required to be used to calculate discounted future net revenues for reporting purposes under GAAP is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor based on the cost of capital in effect from time to time and risks associated with our business and the oil and natural gas industry in general.\nCompetition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense, making it difficult for us to acquire properties, market oil and natural gas and secure trained personnel.\nOur ability to acquire additional prospects and to find and develop reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment for acquiring properties, marketing oil and natural gas and securing trained personnel. Also, there is substantial competition for capital available for investment in the oil and natural gas industry. Many of our competitors possess and employ financial, technical and personnel resources substantially greater than ours. Those companies may be able to pay more for productive oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects and to evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial\nor personnel resources permit. In addition, other companies may be able to offer better compensation packages to attract and retain qualified personnel than we are able to offer. The cost to attract and retain qualified personnel has increased in recent years due to competition and may increase substantially in the future. We may not be able to compete successfully in the future in acquiring prospective reserves, developing reserves, marketing hydrocarbons, attracting and retaining quality personnel and raising additional capital, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur competitors may use superior technology and data resources that we may be unable to afford or that would require a costly investment by us in order to compete with them more effectively.\nOur industry is subject to rapid and significant advancements in technology, including the introduction of new products and services using new technologies and databases. As our competitors use or develop new technologies, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage, and competitive pressures may force us to implement new technologies at a substantial cost. In addition, many of our competitors will have greater financial, technical and personnel resources that allow them to enjoy technological advantages and may in the future allow them to implement new technologies before we can. We cannot be certain that we will be able to implement technologies on a timely basis or at a cost that is acceptable to us. One or more of the technologies that we will use or that we may implement in the future may become obsolete, and we may be adversely affected.\nSEC rules could limit our ability to book additional proved undeveloped reserves (\u201cPUDs\u201d) in the future.\nSEC rules require that, subject to limited exceptions, PUDs may only be booked if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years after the date of booking. This requirement has limited and may continue to limit our ability to book additional PUDs as we pursue our drilling program. Moreover, we may be required to write down our PUDs if we do not drill or plan on delaying those wells within the required five-year timeframe.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Industry\nThe decline in oil and natural gas prices may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOil and gas prices are in the midst of a severe and prolonged downturn although a limited recovery in prices has occurred since late 2016. The significant decline in oil and gas prices since mid-2014 has had, and will continue to have, a significant adverse effect on our business, results of operations, liquidity and the market price of our common stock. The prices received for the Oyo field production will heavily influence our revenue, net income or loss, access to capital and future rate of growth. Oil is a commodity, and its price is subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand. Historically, the market for oil has been volatile. The oil market will likely continue to be volatile in the future. The prices received and the levels of production depend on numerous factors beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u2022\nglobal economic conditions;\n\u2022\nchanges in global supply of and demand for oil or natural gas;\n\u2022\nactions of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) with respect to production levels and pricing;\n\u2022\nprice and quantity of imports of foreign oil;\n\u2022\nlocal and international political, economic and weather conditions;\n\u2022\npolitical and military conflicts in oil producing regions or other geographical areas or acts of terrorism in the U.S. or elsewhere;\n\u2022\ndomestic and international relations, regulations and tax policies;\n\u2022\neffects from the actions of other oil producing countries;\n\u2022\nglobal oil exploration and production levels;\n\u2022\nglobal oil inventory levels;\n\u2022\nthe development, exploitation, price and availability of alternative fuels;\n\u2022\nreduction in energy consumption due to technological advances;\n\u2022\nspeculation by investors in oil and gas; and\n\u2022\nproximity and capacity of transportation pipelines and facilities.\nSignificant and prolonged declines in crude oil and natural gas prices, such as the decline we are currently experiencing, may have the following effects on our business:\n\u2022\nlimiting our financial condition, liquidity and/or ability to fund planned capital expenditures and operations;\n\u2022\nreducing the amount of crude oil and natural gas that we can produce economically;\n\u2022\ncausing us to delay or postpone some of our capital projects;\n\u2022\nreducing our revenues, operating income and cash flows;\n\u2022\nlimiting our access to sources of capital, such as equity and long-term debt;\n\u2022\nreducing the carrying value of our crude oil and natural gas properties; and/or\n\u2022\nreducing the market price of our common stock.\nThe Company may not be successful in finding, acquiring, or developing sufficient petroleum reserves, and a failure to do so could materially adversely affect our financial position, liquidity and ability to continue operations.\nThe Company operates solely in the petroleum extraction business; therefore, if it is not successful in finding crude oil and natural gas sources with good prospects for future production, and exploiting such sources, its business will not be profitable and it may be forced to terminate its operations. Exploring and exploiting oil and gas or other sources of energy entails significant risks, which risks can only be partially mitigated by technology and experienced personnel. The Company or any venture it acquires or participates in may not be successful in finding petroleum or other energy sources, or if it is successful in doing so, the Company may not be successful in developing such resources and producing quantities sufficient to permit the Company to conduct profitable operations. The Company\u2019s future success will depend in large part on the success of its drilling programs and creating and maintaining an inventory of projects. Creating and maintaining an inventory of projects depends on many factors, including, among other things, obtaining rights to explore, develop and produce hydrocarbons in promising areas, drilling success, an ability to bring long lead-time, capital intensive projects to completion on budget and schedule and efficient and profitable operation of mature properties. The Company\u2019s inability to successfully identify and exploit crude oil and natural gas sources would have a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations and could result in the cessation of its business operations.\nIn addition to the numerous operating risks described in more detail in this report and our other filings with the SEC, exploration and exploitation of energy sources involve the risk that no commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs will be discovered or, if discovered, that the cost or timing of drilling, completing and producing wells will not result in profitable operations. The Company\u2019s drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or abandoned as a result of a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022\nadverse weather conditions;\n\u2022\nunexpected drilling conditions;\n\u2022\nirregularities in formations;\n\u2022\npressure irregularities;\n\u2022\nequipment failures or accidents;\n\u2022\ninability to comply with governmental requirements;\n\u2022\nshortages or delays in the availability of drillings rigs;\n\u2022\nshortages or delays in the availability of other oilfield equipment and services; and\n\u2022\nshortages or unavailability of qualified labor to complete the drilling programs according to our business plan schedule.\nOur offshore production and exploration activities will involve special risks that could adversely affect operations.\nOffshore operations are subject to a variety of operating risks specific to the marine environment, such as capsizing, collisions and damage or loss from hurricanes or other adverse weather conditions. These conditions can cause substantial damage to facilities and interrupt our operations. As a result, we could incur substantial expenses that could reduce or eliminate the funds available for exploration, development or leasehold acquisitions, or result in the loss of equipment and properties.\nDeepwater exploration and production generally involves greater operational and financial risks than drilling on the continental shelf or onshore. Deepwater drilling generally requires more time and more advanced drilling technologies, involving a higher risk of technological failure and usually higher drilling costs. Such risks are particularly applicable to our deepwater operations in the Oyo field. In addition, there may be production risks of which we are currently unaware. Whether we use existing pipeline infrastructure, participate in the development of new subsea infrastructure or use floating production systems to transport oil from producing wells, if any, these operations may require substantial time for installation, or encounter mechanical difficulties and equipment failures that could result in significant cost overruns and delays. Furthermore, operations in frontier areas generally lack the physical and oilfield service infrastructure present in more mature basins. As a result, a significant amount of time may elapse between a discovery and the marketing of the associated hydrocarbons, increasing both the financial and operational risk involved with these operations. Because of the lack and high cost of this infrastructure, oil and gas discoveries we make in the deepwater, if any, may never be economically producible.\nIn addition, in the event of a well control incident, containment and, potentially, cleanup activities for offshore drilling are costly. The resulting regulatory costs or penalties, and the results of third party lawsuits, as well as associated legal and support expenses, including costs to address negative publicity, could well exceed the actual costs of containment and cleanup. As a result, a well control incident could result in substantial liabilities for us, and have a significant negative impact on our earnings, cash flows, liquidity, financial position, and stock price, the result of which could force us to seek bankruptcy protection.\nThe energy market in which the Company operates is highly competitive.\nCompetition in the oil and gas industry is intense, particularly with respect to access to drilling rigs and other services, the acquisition of properties and the hiring and retention of technical personnel. The Company expects competition in the market to remain intense because of the increasing global demand for energy, and that competition will increase significantly as new companies enter the market and current competitors continue to seek new sources of energy and leverage existing sources. Many of the Company\u2019s competitors, including large oil companies, have an established presence in the areas that we do business and have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, development, extraction and other resources and greater name recognition than the Company does. As a result, they may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies, changes in regulations affecting the industry, newly discovered resources and exploration opportunities, as well as to large swings in oil and natural gas prices. In addition, increased competition could result in lower energy prices, reduced margins and loss of market share, any of which could harm the Company\u2019s business. Furthermore, increased competition may harm the Company\u2019s ability to secure ventures on terms favorable to it and may lead to higher costs and reduced profitability, which may seriously harm its business.\nHedging transactions may limit the Company\u2019s potential gains and increase the Company\u2019s potential losses.\nTo date, the Company has not entered into any hedging transactions but may do so in the future. In the event that the Company chooses not to hedge its exposure to reductions in oil and gas prices, it could be subject to significant reduction in prices which could have a material adverse impact on its results of operations and profitability. Alternatively, the Company may elect to enter into hedging transactions with respect to a portion of its production to achieve more predictable cash flow and to reduce its exposure to price fluctuations. The use of hedging transactions could limit future revenues from price increases and could expose the Company to adverse changes in basis risk, the relationship between the price of the specific oil or gas being hedged and the price of the commodity underlying the futures contracts or other instruments used in the hedging transaction. Hedging transactions also involve the risk that the counterparty does not satisfy its obligations.\nThe Company may be required to take non-cash asset write-downs.\nUnder applicable accounting rules, during 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $78.7 million, $0.6 million and $261.2 million, respectively. The 2017 and 2015 write offs were mainly due to the carrying value of the oilfield assets not being recoverable under the then current market conditions. The 2016 write-off is related to the carrying value of its offshore leases in Kenya because the Company no longer intends to renew or extend its leases on these offshore blocks. The Company may record additional impairment charges in future periods if oil and natural gas prices do not recover or if there are substantial downward adjustments to its estimated proved reserves, increases in its estimates of development costs or deterioration in its exploration results. Accounting standards require the Company to review its long-lived assets for possible impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable over time. In such cases, if the asset\u2019s estimated undiscounted future net cash flows are less than its carrying amount, impairment exists. Any impairment write-down, which would equal the excess of the carrying amount of the assets being written down over their estimated fair value, would have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s earnings, which could be material.\nCyber incidents may adversely impact our operations.\nWe have become increasingly dependent upon digital technologies to operate our exploration, development and production business. We depend on digital technology to estimate quantities of oil and gas reserves, process and record financial and operating data, analyze seismic and drilling information and communicate with our employees and third-party partners. Unauthorized access to our non-public seismic data, reserves information or other proprietary information could lead to a decrease in our competitiveness, data corruption, communication interruption or other operational disruptions in our exploration or production operations. Also, nearly all of the oil and gas distribution systems in the world are dependent on digital technologies. The U.S. government has issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of cyber security threats. Deliberate attacks on, or unintentional events affecting, our systems or infrastructure or the systems or infrastructure of third parties could lead to corruption or loss of our proprietary data and potentially sensitive data, delays in production or delivery\nof oil or natural gas, difficulty in completing and settling transactions, challenges in maintaining our books and records, environmental damage, communication interruptions, other operational disruptions and third-party liability. We have not suffered any material losses relating to such attacks to date; however, we may suffer material losses in the future. Although historically we have not incurred material expenditures for protective measures related to potential cyber-attacks, as cyber-attacks continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerabilities we have to cyber-attacks.\nDeclining general economic, business or industry conditions may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nConcerns over global economic conditions, energy costs, geopolitical issues, inflation and the availability and cost of credit have contributed to increased economic uncertainty and diminished expectations for the global economy. These factors, combined with volatile prices of oil and natural gas, declining business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment, have precipitated an economic slowdown and a recession. Concerns about global economic growth have had a significant adverse impact on global financial markets and commodity prices. If the global economic climate continues to deteriorate, demand for petroleum products could diminish, which could impact the price at which we can sell our oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, affect the ability of our vendors, suppliers and customers to continue operations and ultimately adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nRisks Related to International Operations\nThe Company\u2019s international operations subject it to certain risks inherent in conducting business in Sub-Saharan Africa, including political instability and foreign government regulation, which could significantly impact the Company\u2019s ability to operate in such countries and materially impact the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe Company conducts substantially all of its business in Sub-Saharan Africa. The Company\u2019s present and future international operations in foreign countries are, and will be, subject to risks generally associated with conducting businesses in foreign countries, such as:\n\u2022\nlaws and regulations that may be materially different from those of the United States;\n\u2022\nchanges in applicable laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nchallenges to or failure of title;\n\u2022\nlabor and political unrest;\n\u2022\ncurrency fluctuations;\n\u2022\nchanges in economic and political conditions;\n\u2022\nexport and import restrictions;\n\u2022\ntariffs, customs, duties and other trade barriers;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing operations;\n\u2022\nlonger time period and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable and enforcing agreements;\n\u2022\npossible loss of properties due to nationalization or expropriation; and\n\u2022\nlimitations on repatriation of income or capital.\nSpecifically, foreign governments may enact and enforce laws and regulations requiring increased ownership by businesses and/or state agencies in energy producing businesses and the facilities used by these businesses, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ownership interests in its then existing ventures. The Company\u2019s ownership structure may not be adequate to accomplish the Company\u2019s business objectives in Nigeria or in any other foreign jurisdiction where the Company may operate. Foreign governments also may impose additional taxes and/or royalties on the Company\u2019s business, which would adversely affect the Company\u2019s profitability and value of its foreign assets, including its interests in the OMLs. In certain locations, governments have imposed restrictions, controls and taxes, and in others, political conditions exist that may threaten the safety of employees and the Company\u2019s continued presence in those countries. Internal unrest, acts of violence or strained relations between a foreign government and the Company or other governments may adversely affect its operations. These developments may, at times, significantly affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and must be carefully considered by its management when evaluating the level of current and future activity in such countries.\nThe future success of the Company\u2019s operations may also be adversely affected by risks associated with international activities, including economic and labor conditions, political instability, risk of war, nationalization or other expropriation of private enterprises, repatriation, termination, renegotiation or modification of existing contracts, tax laws (including host-country import-\nexport, excise and income taxes and United States taxes on foreign subsidiaries), restrictions on currency conversion, devaluations of currency, restrictions or prohibitions on dividend payments to stockholders or changes in government policies, laws or regulations. For example, the Nigerian government has implemented certain control measures with regards to the quarterly exportation and sale of crude oil products from Nigeria. Accordingly, petroleum producers are required to obtain export permits quarterly for crude oil liftings. During the period from May to September 2015, the Company produced approximately 1.5 million Bbls of crude oil but only sold approximately 0.6 million Bbls due to unexpected delays in the issuance of export permits for the quarter ending September 30, 2015. Realization of any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows and result in the loss of all or substantially all of the Company\u2019s assets or in a total loss of your investment in the Company.\nWe are subject to extensive environmental regulations.\nOur operations are subject to extensive national, state and local environmental regulations. Environmental rules and regulations cover oil exploration and development activities as well as transportation, refining and production activities. These regulations establish, among others, quality standards for hydrocarbon products, air emissions, water discharges and waste disposal, environmental standards for abandoned crude oil wells, remedies for soil, water pollution and the general storage, handling, transportation and treatment of hydrocarbons. Non-compliance with environmental laws may result in fines, restrictions on operations or other sanctions. We are also subject to state and local environmental regulations issued by the regional environmental authorities, which oversee compliance with each state\u2019s environmental laws and regulations by oil and gas companies. If we fail to comply with any of these national or local environmental regulations we could be subject to administrative and criminal penalties, including warnings, fines and facilities closure orders.\nIn Nigeria, where we are currently producing, environmental regulations will substantially impact our operations and business results as a result of the creation of the Federal Ministry of Environment (\u201cFME\u201d) in 1999 and the enactment of more rigorous laws, such as the Environmental Guidelines and Standards for the Petroleum Industry in Nigeria (EGASPIN) 2002. Under the Environmental Impact Assessment Act of 1992, all exploratory project drilling must have an environmental impact assessment approved by the FME and must receive an environmental permit from the local authorities. We are required to prevent the escape of petroleum into any water, well, spring, stream river, lake reservoir, estuary or harbor, and government inspectors may examine our premises to ensure that we comply with the regulations. The Department of Petroleum Resources also regulates environmental issues by requiring operators in the oil and gas industry to obtain permits for oil-related effluent discharges from point sources and oil-related project development.\nCompliance and enforcement of environmental laws and regulations, including those related to climate change, may affect operations and cause the Company to incur significant expenditures.\nExtensive national, regional and local environmental laws and regulations in Africa are expected to have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s operations. These laws and regulations set various standards regulating certain aspects of health and environmental quality, which provide for user fees, penalties and other liabilities for the violation of these standards. As new environmental laws and regulations are enacted and existing laws are repealed, interpretation, application and enforcement of the laws may become inconsistent. Compliance with applicable local laws in the future could require significant expenditures, which may adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations. The enactment of any such laws, rules or regulations in the future may have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s projected growth, which could decrease projected revenues or increase costs. In addition, non-governmental organizations concerned with the environment may take an interest in the Company\u2019s operations and attempt to disrupt or halt operations in areas deemed environmentally sensitive. The Company\u2019s response to these efforts could require unforeseen expenditures, cause delays in execution, and affect operations.\nWe may be exposed to liabilities under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, and the continued existence of official corruption and bribery in Africa, and the inability or unwillingness of authorities to combat such corruption, may negatively impact our ability to fairly and effectively compete.\nWe are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and other laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials and political parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We do business and may do additional business in the future in countries and regions in which we may face, directly or indirectly, corrupt demands by officials, tribal or insurgent organizations, or private entities. Thus, we face the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of our employees or consultants, given that these parties may not always be subject to our control. Our existing safeguards and any future improvements may prove to be less than effective, and our employees and consultants may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible. In the future, we may be partnered with other companies with\nwhom we are unfamiliar. Violations of the FCPA may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, and we may be subject to other liabilities, which could negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOfficial corruption and bribery remains a serious concern in Sub-Saharan Africa. For example, the 2016 Transparency International report ranked Nigeria 136 out of 176 countries in terms of corruption perceptions. In an attempt to combat corruption in the oil and gas sector, the National Assembly passed the Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative Act 2007. This action permitted Nigeria to become a candidate country under the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (\u201cEITI\u201d), the first step in bringing transparency to all material oil, gas and mining payments to the Nigerian government. In addition, Nigeria has amended its banking laws to permit the government to bring corrupt bank officials to justice. Several notable cases have been brought, but, to date, few significant cases have been successful and bank regulatory oversight remains a concern. Thus, increased diligence may be required in working with or through Nigerian banks or with Nigerian governmental authorities, and interactions with government officials may need to be monitored. To the extent that such efforts to increase transparency are unsuccessful, and competitors utilize the existence of corruptive practices in order to secure an unfair advantage, our financial condition and results of operations may suffer.\nA deterioration of relations between the United States and Nigeria or other African governments could have a material adverse effect on the Company, the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock and the value of the Company\u2019s investments.\nAt various times during recent years, the United States has had significant disagreements over political, economic and security issues with governments in Sub-Saharan Africa. Additional controversies may arise in the future. Any political or trade controversies, whether or not directly related to the Company\u2019s business, could have a material adverse effect on the Company, the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock and the value of the Company\u2019s investments in Sub-Saharan Africa.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Stock\nDr. Lawal is our controlling stockholder, and he may take actions that conflict with the interests of other stockholders.\nThe Company has been advised that on July 5, 2017, Oltasho and Latmol entered into a Voting Agreement with Dr. Lawal, the Company\u2019s former Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors and former Chief Executive Officer, who retired from the Company in May 2016 (the \u201cVoting Agreement\u201d). Pursuant to the Voting Agreement, Oltasho and Latmol provided complete authority to Dr. Lawal to vote the 117,624,760 shares held by such entities (and any other securities of the Company obtained by Oltasho and/or Latmol in the future) at any and all meetings of stockholders of the Company and via any written consents. Those 117,624,760 shares represent 54.7%of the Company\u2019s outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2017. The Voting Agreement has a term of approximately 10 years, through July 31, 2027, but can be terminated at any time with the mutual consent of the parties. In connection with their entry into the Voting Agreement, Oltasho and Latmol each provided Dr. Lawal an irrevocable voting proxy to vote the shares covered by the Voting Agreement. Additionally, during the term of such agreement, Oltasho and Latmol agreed not to transfer the shares covered by the Voting Agreement except pursuant to certain limited exceptions\nDue to the Voting Agreement, Dr. Lawal controls the power to elect our directors, to appoint members of management (through control of the board) and to approve all actions requiring the approval of the holders of our common stock, including adopting amendments to our Certificate of Incorporation and approving mergers, acquisitions or sales of all or substantially all of our assets, subject to certain restrictive covenants. The interests of Dr. Lawal as our controlling stockholder could conflict with your interests as a holder of Company common stock. For example, Dr. Lawal as our controlling stockholder may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, financings or other transactions that, in his judgment, could enhance his equity investment even though such transactions might involve risks to you, as minority holders of the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s stockholders may not be able to enforce United States civil liabilities claims.\nMany of the Company\u2019s assets are and are expected to continue to be located outside the United States and held through one or more subsidiaries incorporated under the laws of foreign jurisdictions. Substantially all of the Company\u2019s operations are and are expected to continue to be conducted in Africa. In addition, some of the Company\u2019s directors and officers, including directors and officers of its subsidiaries, may be residents of countries other than the United States. All or a substantial portion of the assets of these persons may be located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for shareholders to effect service of process within the United States upon these persons. In addition, there is uncertainty as to whether the foreign courts would recognize or enforce judgments of United States courts obtained against the Company or such persons predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state thereof or be competent to hear original actions brought\nin these countries against the Company or such persons predicated upon the securities laws of the United States or any state thereof.\nThe market price of the Company\u2019s common stock may be adversely affected by a number of factors related to the Company\u2019s performance, the performance of other energy-related companies and the stock market in general.\nThe market prices of securities of energy companies are extremely volatile and sometimes reach unsustainable levels that bear no relationship to the past or present operating performance of such companies.\nFactors that may contribute to the volatility of the trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock include, among others:\n\u2022\nfinancial predictions and recommendations by stock analysts concerning energy companies and companies competing in the Company\u2019s market in general, and concerning the Company in particular;\n\u2022\nthe Company\u2019s quarterly results of operations or variances between the Company\u2019s actual quarterly results of operations and predictions by stock analysts;\n\u2022\npublic announcements of regulatory changes or new ventures relating to the Company\u2019s business or its competitors, or acquisitions, joint ventures or strategic alliances by the Company or its competitors;\n\u2022\ninvestor perception of the Company\u2019s business prospects or those of the oil and gas industry in general;\n\u2022\nthe timing of commencement of production of new wells;\n\u2022\nthe operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors or stock analysts may deem comparable to the Company;\n\u2022\nlarge purchases or sales of the Company\u2019s common stock; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and financial conditions.\nIn addition to the foregoing factors, the trading prices for equity securities in the stock market in general, and of energy-related companies in particular, have historically been subject to wide fluctuations that may be unrelated to the operating performance of the particular company affected by such fluctuations. Consequently, broad market fluctuations may have an adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock regardless of the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe limited market for the Company\u2019s common stock may adversely affect trading prices or the ability of a shareholder to sell the Company\u2019s shares in the public market at or near asking prices or at all if a shareholder needs to liquidate its shares.\nThe market price for shares of the Company\u2019s common stock has been, and is expected to continue to be, volatile. Numerous factors beyond the Company\u2019s control may have a significant effect on the market price for shares of the Company\u2019s common stock, including the fact that the Company is a small company that is relatively unknown to stock analysts, stock brokers, institutional investors and others in the investment community that generate or influence sales volumes. There may be periods of several days or more when trading activity in the Company\u2019s shares is minimal as compared to a seasoned issuer which has a large and steady volume of trading activity that will generally support continuous sales without an adverse effect on share price. Due to these conditions, investors may not be able to sell their shares at or near ask prices or at all if investors desire to liquidate their shares.\nOur common stock is listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (\u201cJSE\u201d). However, a trading market may not successfully develop on the JSE.\nThere is a limited trading market for our common stock on the JSE. An active trading market may not successfully develop on the JSE, or if it does, it may not be sustained. In addition, our listing on the JSE may have a negative effect on our trading market on the NYSE American. In 2014, we issued an aggregate of 62.8 million shares of our common stock to the Public Investment Corporation (SOC) Limited (\u201cPIC\u201d) of South Africa in a private placement. If PIC chooses to sell those shares on the JSE, sales of a large number of shares could have a negative effect on the market price of our shares on the JSE, which could have a negative effect on the market price of our shares on the NYSE American.\nSubstantial sales of the Company\u2019s common stock could cause the Company\u2019s stock price to fall.\nThe potential for substantial amounts of our common stock to be sold in the public market may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock and could impair the Company\u2019s ability to raise capital through the sale of its equity securities. Additionally, we may issue and register a greater number of shares of common stock in order to meet our obligations\nto pay up to $50.0 million in oil and gas milestone payments under the Transfer Agreement or upon conversion of the 2014 Convertible Subordinated Note or the 2015 Convertible Note.\nConversion of the 2014 Convertible Subordinated Note or the 2015 Convertible Note, in the event of a default thereunder, may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders.\nThe conversion of some or all of the 2014 Convertible Subordinated Note or the 2015 Convertible Note, in the event of a default thereunder, may dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders. The 2014 Convertible Subordinated Note is convertible into 14.0 million shares of our common stock, which represents approximately 6.51% of our currently outstanding shares. The 2014 Convertible Subordinated Note is subject to anti-dilution adjustment provisions, including provisions that make it convertible into the same percentage of our outstanding shares if we issue shares of common stock or any convertible security at a price per share less than the conversion price. The 2015 Convertible Note is convertible into shares of the Company\u2019s common stock upon the occurrence and continuation of an event of default thereunder, at the sole option of the holder. The number of shares issuable upon conversion is equal to the sum of the principal amount and the accrued and unpaid interest divided by the conversion price, defined as the volume weighted average of the closing sales prices on the NYSE American for a share of common stock for the five complete trading days immediately preceding the conversion date. Any sales in the public market of the shares of our common stock issuable upon such conversions could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the anticipated conversion of the 2014 Convertible Subordinated Note or the 2015 Convertible Note into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock.\nThe Company\u2019s issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect the value of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThe Company\u2019s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to 50.0 million shares of preferred stock, which shares constitute what is commonly referred to as \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock. This preferred stock may be issued by the Board of Directors from time to time on any number of occasions, without stockholder approval, (subject where applicable to the rules of the NYSE American, which generally prohibit the issuance of securities convertible into more than 20% of an issuer\u2019s common stock without shareholder approval), as one or more separate series of shares comprised of any number of the authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock, designated by resolution of the Board of Directors, stating the name and number of shares of each series and setting forth separately for such series the relative rights, privileges and preferences thereof, including, if any, the: (i) rate of dividends payable thereon; (ii) price, terms and conditions of redemption; (iii) voluntary and involuntary liquidation preferences; (iv) provisions of a sinking fund for redemption or repurchase; (v) terms of conversion to common stock, including conversion price; and (vi) voting rights. The designation of such shares could be dilutive of the interest of the holders of our common stock. The ability to issue such preferred stock could also give the Company\u2019s Board of Directors the ability to hinder or discourage any attempt to gain control of the Company by a merger, tender offer at a control premium price, proxy contest or otherwise.\nWe do not presently intend to pay any cash dividends on or repurchase any shares of our common stock.\nWe do not presently intend to pay any cash dividends on our common stock or to repurchase any shares of our common stock. Any payment of future dividends will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on, among other things, our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, statutory and contractual restrictions applying to the payment of dividends and other considerations that our Board of Directors deems relevant. Cash dividend payments in the future may only be made out of legally available funds and, if we experience substantial losses, such funds may not be available. Accordingly, you may have to sell some or all of your common stock in order to generate cash flow from your investment, and there is no guarantee that the price of our common stock that will prevail in the market will ever exceed the price paid by you.\nShareholders may be diluted significantly through our efforts to obtain financing and satisfy obligations through the issuance of securities.\nWherever possible, our Board of Directors will attempt to use non-cash consideration to satisfy obligations. In many instances, we believe that the non-cash consideration will consist of shares of our common stock, preferred stock or warrants to purchase shares of our common stock. Our Board of Directors has authority, without action or vote of the shareholders, subject to the requirements of the NYSE American (which generally require shareholder approval for any transactions which would result in the issuance of more than 20% of our then outstanding shares of common stock or voting rights representing over 20% of our then outstanding shares of stock), to issue all or part of the authorized but unissued shares of common stock, preferred stock or warrants to purchase such shares of common stock. In addition, we may attempt to raise capital by selling shares of our common\nstock, possibly at a discount to market in the future. These actions will result in dilution of the ownership interests of existing shareholders and may further dilute common stock book value, and that dilution may be material. Such issuances may also serve to enhance existing management\u2019s ability to maintain control of us, because the shares may be issued to parties or entities committed to supporting existing management.\nWe are subject to the Continued Listing Criteria of the NYSE American and our failure to satisfy these criteria may result in delisting of our common stock.\nOur common stock is currently listed on the NYSE American. In order to maintain this listing, we must maintain certain share prices, financial and share distribution targets, including maintaining a minimum amount of shareholders\u2019 equity and a minimum number of public shareholders. In addition to these objective standards, the NYSE American may delist the securities of any issuer if, in its opinion, the issuer\u2019s financial condition and/or operating results appear unsatisfactory; if it appears that the extent of public distribution or the aggregate market value of the security has become so reduced as to make continued listing on the NYSE American inadvisable; if the issuer sells or disposes of principal operating assets or ceases to be an operating company; if an issuer fails to comply with the NYSE American\u2019s listing requirements; if an issuer\u2019s common stock sells at what the NYSE American considers a \u201clow selling price\u201d (generally trading below $0.20 per share for an extended period of time) and the issuer fails to correct this via a reverse split of shares after notification by the NYSE American (provided that issuers can also be delisted if any shares of the issuer trade below $0.06 per share); or if any other event occurs or any condition exists which makes continued listing on the NYSE American, in its opinion, inadvisable.\nIf the NYSE American delists our common stock, investors may face material adverse consequences, including, but not limited to, a lack of trading market for our securities, reduced liquidity, decreased analyst coverage of our securities, and an inability for us to obtain additional financing to fund our operations.", "PERMNO": 93106, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "ERINQ"}
