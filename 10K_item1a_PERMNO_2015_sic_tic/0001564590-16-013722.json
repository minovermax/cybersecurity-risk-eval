These risks are not the only ones that we may face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also impair our business operations. This report also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including the risks faced by us described below or elsewhere in this report.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls or discover material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately or detect fraud, which could harm our business and the trading price of our Common Stock.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important in our effort to prevent financial fraud. We are required to periodically evaluate the effectiveness of the design and operation of our internal controls. As has occurred in several years prior, these evaluations may result in the conclusion that enhancements, modifications or changes to our internal controls are necessary or desirable. While management evaluates the effectiveness of our internal controls on a regular basis, these controls may not always be effective. There are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of internal controls, including collusion, management override, and failure of human judgment. Because of this, control procedures are designed to reduce rather than eliminate business risks. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls or if management or our independent registered public accounting firm were to discover material weaknesses in our internal controls, we may be unable to produce reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, which could harm our financial condition and operating results, and could result in a loss of investor confidence and a decline in our stock price.\nIf we fail to comply with the terms of our Corporate Integrity Agreement (and a related term of probation) we may be subject to criminal prosecution and/or exclusion from federal healthcare programs.\nOn June 6, 2012, in connection with our settlement of a U.S. government investigation and related qui tam complaint related to our regenerative stimulation business, and our settlement of a U.S. government investigation and related qui tam complaint related to Blackstone Medical, Inc. (\u201cBlackstone\u201d), we entered into a five-year corporate integrity agreement (the \u201cCIA\u201d) with the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services (\u201cHHS-OIG\u201d). The CIA acknowledges the existence of our current compliance program, and requires that we continue to maintain during the term of the CIA a compliance program designed to promote compliance with federal healthcare and Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d) requirements. We are also required to maintain several elements of the existing program during the term of the CIA, including maintaining a Chief Compliance Officer, a Compliance Committee, and a Code of Conduct. The CIA requires that we conduct certain additional compliance-related activities during the term of the CIA, including various training and monitoring procedures, and maintaining a disciplinary process for compliance obligations. Pursuant to the CIA, we are required to notify the HHS-OIG in writing, among other things, of: (i) any ongoing government investigation or legal proceeding involving an allegation that the Company has committed a crime or has engaged in fraudulent activities; (ii) any other matter that a reasonable person would consider a probable violation of applicable criminal, civil, or administrative laws related to compliance with federal healthcare programs or FDA requirements; and (iii) any change in location, sale, closing, purchase, or establishment of a new business unit or location related to items or services that may be reimbursed by federal healthcare programs. We are also subject to periodic reporting and certification requirements attesting that the provisions of the CIA are being implemented and followed, as well as certain document and record retention mandates. The CIA provides that in the event of an uncured material breach of the CIA, we could be excluded from participation in federal healthcare programs and/or subject to prosecution and subject to other monetary penalties, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nIn connection with this settlement and the guilty plea of our subsidiary, Orthofix Inc., to one felony count of obstruction of a federal audit (18 U.S.C. \u00a71516), the court imposed a five-year term of probation on Orthofix Inc., with special conditions that mandate certain non-disparagement obligations and order Orthofix Inc. to continue complying with the terms of the CIA through the expiration of its term. In the event that we fail to satisfy these terms of probation, we could be subject to additional criminal penalties or prosecution, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are investigating allegations involving potential improper payments with respect to our subsidiary in Brazil, which has caused an extension of the term of our existing Deferred Prosecution Agreement in connection with a prior FCPA settlement.\nIn 2012, the Company entered into definitive agreements with the U.S. Department of Justice (the \u201cDOJ\u201d) and the SEC agreeing to settle a self-initiated and self-reported internal investigation of our Mexican subsidiary, Promeca S.A. de C.V. (\u201cPromeca\u201d), regarding non-compliance by Promeca with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d). As part of the settlement, we entered into a three-year deferred prosecution agreement (\u201cDPA\u201d) with the DOJ and a consent to final judgment (the \u201cConsent\u201d) with the SEC. The DOJ agreed not to pursue any criminal charges against us in connection with the Promeca matter if we comply with the terms of the DPA. The DPA takes note of our self-reporting of this matter to the DOJ and the SEC, and of remedial measures, including the implementation of an enhanced compliance program, previously undertaken by us. The DPA and the Consent collectively require, among other things, that with respect to anti-bribery compliance matters we shall continue to cooperate fully with the government in any future matters related to corrupt payments, false books and records or inadequate internal controls. In that regard, we have represented that we have implemented and will continue to implement a compliance and ethics program designed to prevent and detect violations of the FCPA and other applicable anti-corruption laws. We are periodically reporting to the government during the term of the DPA regarding such remediation and implementation of compliance measures.\nIn August 2013, the Company\u2019s internal legal department was notified of certain allegations involving potential improper payments with respect to its Brazilian subsidiary, Orthofix do Brasil Ltda. The Company engaged outside counsel to assist in the review of these matters, focusing on compliance with applicable anti-bribery laws, including the FCPA. Consistent with the provisions of these agreements, the Company contacted the DOJ and the SEC in August 2013 to voluntarily self-report the Brazil-related allegations. On June 15, 2015, the Company and the DOJ agreed to extend the term of the DPA for two months (through September 17, 2015) to permit the DOJ additional time to evaluate the Company\u2019s compliance with the internal controls and compliance undertakings in the DPA and to further investigate the Brazil-related allegations. On September 17, 2015, the DOJ extended the term of the DPA for an additional ten months (through July 17, 2016), stating that the Company\u2019s efforts to comply with the internal controls and compliance requirements of the DPA during the first eighteen months of the DPA were insufficient.\nIn the event that the DOJ were to determine in the future to criminally prosecute us for the FCPA-related matters we have self-reported, we could be subject to penalties that could have a material adverse effect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe SEC Enforcement Staff\u2019s investigation and a pending securities class action complaint have resulted in significant costs and expenses, have diverted resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nAs further described in Part I, Item 3, \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d of this Form 10-K, in July 2013, the Audit Committee (the \u201cAudit Committee\u201d) of the Board of Directors of the Company began conducting an independent review, with the assistance of outside professionals, of certain accounting matters. This review resulted in a March 2014 completed multi-year restatement of our historical consolidated financial statements. In March 2015, we completed a further multi-year restatement of historical consolidated financial statements.\nWe initiated contact with the staff of the Division of Enforcement of the SEC (the \u201cSEC Enforcement Staff\u201d) in July 2013 to advise them of the initiation of the Audit Committee\u2019s review and the then-potential restatement of our annual audited and interim unaudited consolidated financial statements. The SEC is conducting a formal investigation of these matters, and both the Company and the Audit Committee are cooperating fully with the SEC. Since our initial contact, we have received requests from the SEC for documents and other information concerning various accounting practices, internal controls and business practices, and it is anticipated that we may receive additional such requests in the future. We have further provided notice concerning these matters to HHS-OIG pursuant to our CIA with HHS-OIG, which is described in more detail in Part I, Item 3, \u201cLegal Proceedings.\u201d\nAs also further described in Part I, Item 3, \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d of this Form 10-K, on August 14, 2013, a securities class action complaint against the Company was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York arising out of the restatement of our prior consolidated financial statements and the matters described above. The lead plaintiff\u2019s complaint, as amended, purports to bring claims on behalf of persons who purchased the Company\u2019s common stock between March 2, 2010 and July 29, 2013. The complaint asserts that the Company and four of its former executive officers, Alan W. Milinazzo, Robert S. Vaters, Brian McCollum, and Emily V. Buxton (collectively, the \u201cIndividual Defendants\u201d), violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), and Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 10b-5 (\u201cRule 10b-5\u201d) by making false or misleading statements in or relating to the Company\u2019s financial statements. The complaint further asserts that the Individual Defendants were liable as control persons under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act for any violation by the Company of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act or Rule 10b-5. As relief, the complaint requests compensatory damages on behalf of the proposed class and lead plaintiff\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. On March 6, 2015, the court granted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss as to Mr. Milinazzo and denied it with respect to the Company and the other Individual Defendants.\nOn October 22, 2015, following negotiations facilitated by an independent mediator, the Company, the remaining Individual Defendants and their insurers reached an agreement in principle with the plaintiff, individually and on behalf of the class it purports to represent, to settle and release all claims with respect to this matter and to dismiss the action with prejudice subject to final court approval. Under the terms of the agreement in principle, the Company, through its insurers, would make a payment to the plaintiff, and the class it purports to represent, to resolve all claims related to the matter, including any claims for plaintiff counsel\u2019s fees and expenses. On December 7, 2015, all parties to the action executed and filed with the Court a proposed settlement agreement whose terms are consistent with the above-described agreement in principle. On December 18, 2015, the Court entered a preliminary approval order which, among other things, preliminarily approved the terms of the proposed settlement agreement, subject to a final approval hearing scheduled for April 28, 2016. The Company has previously incurred and expensed fees and expenses in connection with this matter up to and exceeding its insurance policy deductible and its insurers have undertaken to cover the full amount of the settlement payment, if the proposed settlement is finally approved by the Court.\nWe have incurred and/or expect to incur significant professional fees and other costs in responding to the SEC investigation and in defending against the class action complaint. If we do not prevail in or successfully settle the pending complaint or any other\nlitigation, we may be required to pay a significant amount of monetary damages that may be in excess of our insurance coverage. Further, if the SEC were to conclude that enforcement action is appropriate, or if HHS-OIG were to conclude that we violated the CIA, we could be required to pay large civil penalties and fines. The SEC also could impose other sanctions against us or certain of our current and former directors and officers. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Additionally, while we believe we have made appropriate judgments in determining the errors and correct adjustments in preparing our restated consolidated financial statements, the SEC could disagree with the manner in which we have accounted for and reported these adjustments. Accordingly, there is a risk that we could have to further restate our historical consolidated financial statements, amend prior filings with the SEC or take other actions not currently contemplated.\nThe potential for additional litigation or other proceedings or enforcement actions could adversely affect us, require significant management time and attention, result in significant legal expenses or damages, and cause our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows to suffer.\nThe matters that led to the SEC investigation and the class action complaint described above have also exposed us to greater risks associated with litigation, regulatory proceedings and government enforcement actions. We and current and former members of our senior management may in the future be subject to additional litigation or governmental proceedings relating to such matters. Subject to certain limitations, we are obligated to indemnify our current and former officers and directors in connection with any such lawsuits or governmental proceedings and related litigation or settlement amounts. Regardless of the outcome, these lawsuits and any other litigation or governmental proceedings that may be brought against us or our current or former officers and directors, could be time-consuming, result in significant expense and divert the attention and resources of our management and other key employees. An unfavorable outcome in any of these matters could exceed coverage provided under potentially applicable insurance policies. Any such unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Further, we could be required to pay damages or additional penalties or have other remedies imposed against us, or our current or former directors or officers, which could harm our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nContinuing negative publicity may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nAs a result of the restatement of our consolidated financial statements and related matters, the ongoing SEC investigation, the securities class action complaint and our recent non-compliance with Nasdaq listing rules, we have been the subject of negative publicity. This negative publicity may adversely affect our stock price and may harm our reputation and our relationships with current and future investors, lenders, customers, suppliers and employees. As a result, our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows may be materially adversely affected.\nWe may be subject to federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws, and could face substantial penalties if we are determined not to have fully complied with such laws.\nHealthcare fraud and abuse regulation by federal and state governments impact our business. Healthcare fraud and abuse laws potentially applicable to our operations include:\n\u25cf\nthe federal Health Care Programs Anti-Kickback Law, which constrains our marketing practices, educational programs, pricing and discounting policies, and relationships with healthcare practitioners and providers, by prohibiting, among other things, soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, in exchange for or to induce the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program (such as the Medicare or Medicaid programs);\n\u25cf\nfederal false claims laws, which prohibit, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal government payors that are false or fraudulent; and\n\u25cf\nstate laws analogous to each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws that may apply to items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including commercial insurers.\nDue to the breadth of some of these laws, there can be no assurance that we will not be found to be in violation of any such laws, and as a result we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations or the exclusion from participation in federal or state healthcare programs. Any penalties could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against them, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business.\nIn addition, it is possible that one or more private insurers with whom we do business may attempt to use any penalty we might be assessed or any exclusion from federal or state healthcare program business as a basis to cease doing business with us. If this were to occur, it could also have a material adverse effect on our business and financial position.\nReimbursement policies of third parties, cost containment measures and healthcare reform could adversely affect the demand for our products and limit our ability to sell our products.\nOur products are sold either directly by us or by independent sales representatives to customers or to our independent distributors and purchased by hospitals, doctors and other healthcare providers. These products may be reimbursed by third-party payors, such as government programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and Tricare, or private insurance plans and healthcare networks. Major third-party payors for medical services in the U.S. and internationally continue to work to contain health care costs and are increasingly challenging the policies and the prices charged for medical products and services. Any medical policy developments that eliminate, reduce or materially modify coverage of or reimbursement rates for, our products could have an impact on our ability to sell our products. In addition, third-party payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that a device or product provided to a patient or used in a procedure does not meet applicable payment criteria or if the policyholder\u2019s healthcare insurance benefits are limited. These policies and criteria may be revised from time-to-time.\nLimits put on reimbursement could make it more difficult to buy our products and substantially reduce, or possibly eliminate, patient access to our products. In addition, should governmental authorities continue to enact legislation or adopt regulations that affect third-party coverage and reimbursement, access to our products and coverage by private or public insurers may be reduced with a consequential material adverse effect on our sales and profitability.\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\u201cCMS\u201d), in its ongoing implementation of the Medicare program, has obtained a related technical assessment of the medical study literature to determine how the literature addresses spinal fusion surgery in the Medicare population. The impact that this information will have on Medicare coverage policy for our products is currently unknown, but we cannot provide assurances that the resulting actions will not restrict Medicare coverage for our products. It is also possible that the government\u2019s focus on coverage of off-label uses of devices approved by the FDA could lead to changes in coverage policies regarding off-label uses by TriCare, Medicare and/or Medicaid. There can be no assurance that we or our distributors will not experience significant reimbursement problems in the future related to these or other proceedings. Globally, our products are sold in many countries, such as the U.K., France, and Italy, which have publicly funded healthcare systems. The ability of hospitals supported by such systems to purchase our products is dependent, in part, upon public budgetary constraints. Any increase in such constraints may have a material adverse effect on our sales and collection of accounts receivable from such sales.\nAs required by law, CMS has continued efforts to implement a competitive bidding program for selected durable medical equipment, prosthetic, orthotic supplies (\u201cDMEPOS\u201d) items paid for by the Medicare program. In this program, Medicare rates are based on bid amounts for certain products in designated geographic areas, rather than the Medicare fee schedule amount. Only those suppliers selected through the competitive bidding process within each designated competitive bidding area (CBA) are eligible to have their products reimbursed by Medicare. CMS completed the Round 1 Rebid process in the last quarter of 2012. The implementation of Rebid for Round 1 occurred on January 1, 2013 and for Round 2 on July 1, 2013. Our products are not yet included in the competitive bidding process. We cannot predict which products from any of our businesses will ultimately be affected or whether or when the competitive bidding process will be extended to our businesses. While some of our products are designated by FDA as Class III medical devices and thus are not currently included within the competitive bidding program, some of our products may be encompassed within the program at varying times. There can be no assurance that the implementation of the competitive bidding program will not have an adverse impact on the sales of some of our products.\nWe and certain of our suppliers may be subject to extensive government regulation that increases our costs and could limit our ability to market or sell our products.\nThe medical devices we manufacture and market are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA and numerous other federal, state and foreign governmental authorities. These authorities regulate the development, approval, classification, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing and sale of medical devices. Likewise, our use and disclosure of certain categories of health information may be subject to federal and state laws, implemented and enforced by governmental authorities that protect health information privacy and security. For a description of these regulations, see Item 1, \u201cBusiness,\u201d under the subheading \u201cGovernment Regulation.\u201d\nThe approval or clearance by governmental authorities, including the FDA in the U.S., is generally required before any medical devices may be marketed in the U.S. or other countries. We cannot predict whether, in the future, the U.S. or foreign governments may impose regulations that have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The process of obtaining FDA clearance and other regulatory clearances or approvals to develop and market a medical device can be costly and time-consuming, and is subject to the risk that such approvals will not be granted on a timely basis, if at all. The regulatory\nprocess may delay or prohibit the marketing of new products and impose substantial additional costs if the FDA lengthens review times for new devices. The FDA has the ability to change the regulatory classification of a cleared or approved device from a higher to a lower regulatory classification, which could materially adversely impact our ability to market or sell our devices. In addition, we may be subject to compliance action, penalties or injunctions if we are determined to be promoting the use of our products for unapproved or off-label uses, or if the FDA challenges one or more of our determinations that a product modification did not require new approval or clearance by the FDA.\nWe and certain of our suppliers also are subject to announced and unannounced inspections by the FDA to determine our compliance with FDA\u2019s QSR and other regulations. If the FDA were to find that we or certain of our suppliers have failed to comply with applicable regulations, the agency could institute a wide variety of enforcement actions, ranging from a public warning letter to more severe sanctions such as: fines and civil penalties against us, our officers, our employees or our suppliers; unanticipated expenditures to address or defend such actions; delays in clearing or approving, or refusal to clear or approve, our products; withdrawal or suspension of approval of our products or those of our third-party suppliers by the FDA or other regulatory bodies; product recall or seizure; interruption of production; operating restrictions; injunctions; and criminal prosecution. The FDA also has the authority to request repair, replacement or refund of the cost of any medical device manufactured or distributed by us. Any of the foregoing actions could have a material adverse effect on our development of new laboratory tests, business strategy, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nMoreover, governmental authorities outside the U.S. have become increasingly stringent in their regulation of medical devices, and our products may become subject to more rigorous regulation by non-U.S. governmental authorities in the future. U.S. or non-U.S. government regulations may be imposed in the future that may have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. The European Commission (\u201cEC\u201d) has harmonized national regulations for the control of medical devices through European Medical Device Directives with which manufacturers must comply. Under these new regulations, manufacturing plants must have received a full Quality Assurance Certification from a \u201cNotified Body\u201d in order to be able to sell products within the member states of the European Union. This Certification allows manufacturers to stamp the products of certified plants with a \u201cCE\u201d mark. Products covered by the EC regulations that do not bear the CE mark cannot be sold or distributed within the European Union. We have received certification for all currently existing manufacturing facilities.\nThe impact of the Affordable Care Act (\u201cACA\u201d) and other United States healthcare reform legislation on us remains uncertain.\nIn 2010 federal legislation to reform the United States healthcare system was enacted into law. The ACA is far-reaching and is intended to expand access to health insurance coverage, improve quality and reduce costs over time. The ACA mandated certain CMS demonstration projects to test the effects of new approaches for paying for health services and delivering care, including bundled payments, value-based purchasing programs, establishment of accountable care organizations, a focus on patient-centered homes and physician payment reforms that incentivize the delivery of high quality, resource-conscious health care. Several provisions of the ACA specifically impact the medical equipment industry, including the elimination of the full inflation update to the DMEPOS fee schedule for the years 2011 through 2014. Instead, beginning in 2011, the ACA reduced the inflation update for DMEPOS by a \u201cproductivity adjustment\u201d factor intended to reflect productivity gains in delivering health care services. For 2014, the update factor is 1.0% (reflecting a 1.8% inflation update that is partially offset by a 0.8% \u201cproductivity adjustment\u201d).\nSection 6002 of the ACA, the Physician Payment Sunshine Act, requires medical device, pharmaceutical and biologics manufacturers that participate in U.S. federal health care programs to make annual disclosures regarding payments or transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, including physicians who serve as consultants. The recordkeeping requirements have been in place since August 1, 2013. Applicable Manufacturers and GPOs must submit annual reports to CMS by March 31st for payments and transfers of value made in the prior calendar year. Reports are made available to the public on CMS\u2019 website. Failure to fully and accurately disclose transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals could subject us to civil monetary penalties. Several states also have enacted specific marketing and payment disclosure requirements, and other states may do so in the future.\nWe expect the new law will have a significant impact upon various aspects of our business operations. However, it is unclear how the new law will impact patient access to new technologies or reimbursement rates under the Medicare program. Many of the details of the new law will be included in new and revised regulations, which have not yet been promulgated, and require additional guidance and specificity to be provided by the Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Labor and Department of the Treasury. Accordingly, while it is too early to understand fully and predict the ultimate impact of the new law on our business, the legislation could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur business may be adversely affected if consolidation in the healthcare industry leads to demand for price concessions or if a group purchasing organization or similar entity excludes us from being a supplier.\nBecause healthcare costs have risen significantly over the past decade, numerous initiatives and reforms have been launched by legislators, regulators and third-party payors to curb these costs. As a result, there has been a consolidation trend in the healthcare industry to create larger companies, including hospitals, with greater market power. As the healthcare industry consolidates, competition to provide products and services to industry participants has become and may continue to become more intense. This has resulted and may continue to result in greater pricing pressures and the exclusion of certain suppliers from important markets as group purchasing organizations (\u201cGPOs\u201d), independent delivery networks and large single accounts continue to use their market power to consolidate purchasing decisions. If a GPO were to exclude us from being one of their suppliers, our net sales could be adversely impacted. We expect that market demand, government regulation, third-party reimbursement policies and societal pressures will continue to change the worldwide healthcare industry, which may exert further downward pressure on the prices of our products.\nThe industry in which we operate is highly competitive. New developments by others could make our products or technologies non-competitive or obsolete.\nThe medical devices industry is highly competitive. We compete with a large number of companies, many of which have significantly greater financial, manufacturing, marketing, distribution and technical resources than we do. Many of our competitors may be able to develop products and processes competitive with, or superior to, our own. Furthermore, we may not be able to successfully develop or introduce new products that are less costly or offer better performance than those of our competitors, or offer purchasers of our products payment and other commercial terms as favorable as those offered by our competitors. For more information regarding our competitors, see Item 1, \u201cBusiness,\u201d under the subheading \u201cCompetition.\u201d\nIn addition, the orthopedic medical device industry in which we compete is undergoing, and is characterized by, rapid and significant technological change. We expect competition to intensify as technological advances are made. New technologies and products developed by other companies are regularly introduced into the market, which may render our products or technologies non-competitive or obsolete.\nObsolete inventories as a result of changes in demand for our products and change in life cycles of our products could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe life cycles of some of our products depend heavily upon the life cycles of the end-products into which our products are designed. End-market products with short life cycles require us to manage closely our production and inventory levels. Inventory may also become obsolete because of adverse changes in end-market demand. We may in the future be adversely affected by obsolete or excess inventories, which may result from unanticipated changes in the estimated total demand for our products or the estimated life cycles of the end-products into which our products are designed. In addition, some customers restrict how far back the date of manufacture for our products can be and certain customers may stop ordering products from us and go out of business due to adverse economic conditions; therefore, some of our product inventory may become obsolete and, thus, adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur ability to market products successfully depends, in part, upon the acceptance of the products not only by consumers, but also by independent third parties.\nOur ability to market our BioStim, Biologics, Extremity Fixation and Spine Fixation products successfully depends, in part, on the acceptance of the products by independent third parties (including hospitals, doctors, other healthcare providers and third-party payors) as well as patients. Unanticipated side effects or unfavorable publicity concerning any of our products could have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain hospital approvals or achieve acceptance by prescribing physicians, managed care providers and other retailers, customers and patients.\nWe could be subject to indemnification obligations under our agreement with the purchaser of our former sports medicine business unit.\nIn May 2012, we sold our former sports medicine business unit, Breg, Inc., to an affiliate of Water Street Healthcare Partners II, L.P. pursuant to a stock purchase agreement between us and the buyer. Under the stock purchase agreement, we agreed to indemnify the buyer with respect to certain specified matters, including (i) an ongoing U.S. government investigation and certain ongoing product liability matters relating to a previously owned infusion pump product line, and (ii) product liability claims relating to pre-closing sales of cold therapy units and certain post-closing sales of cold therapy units. These matters are further described under the subheading \u201cMatters Related to Our Former Breg Subsidiary and Possible Indemnification Obligations\u201d in Part I, Item 3, \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d. We currently cannot reasonably estimate the possible loss, or range of loss, in connection with certain of these\nindemnified matters. In the event they are substantial, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe depend on our ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights, but we may not be able to maintain the confidentiality, or assure the protection, of these assets.\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to protect our current and future technologies and products and to defend our intellectual property rights. If we fail to protect our intellectual property adequately, competitors may manufacture and market products similar to, or that compete directly with, ours. Numerous patents covering our technologies have been issued to us, and we have filed, and expect to continue to file, patent applications seeking to protect newly developed technologies and products in various countries, including the U.S. Some patent applications in the U.S. are maintained in secrecy until the patent is issued. Because the publication of discoveries tends to follow their actual discovery by several months, we may not be the first to invent, or file patent applications on any of our discoveries. Patents may not be issued with respect to any of our patent applications and existing or future patents issued to, or licensed by, us and may not provide adequate protection or competitive advantages for our products. Patents that are issued may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors. Furthermore, our patent rights may not prevent our competitors from developing, using or commercializing products that are similar or functionally equivalent to our products.\nWe also rely on trade secrets, unpatented proprietary expertise and continuing technological innovation that we protect, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with assignors, licensees, suppliers, employees and consultants. These agreements may be breached and there may not be adequate remedies in the event of a breach. Disputes may arise concerning the ownership of intellectual property or the applicability or enforceability of confidentiality agreements. Moreover, our trade secrets and proprietary technology may otherwise become known or be independently developed by our competitors. If patents are not issued with respect to our products arising from research, we may not be able to maintain the confidentiality of information relating to these products. In addition, if a patent relating to any of our products lapses or is invalidated, we may experience greater competition arising from new market entrants.\nThird parties may claim that we infringe on their proprietary rights and may prevent us from manufacturing and selling certain of our products.\nThere has been substantial litigation in the medical device industry with respect to the manufacture, use and sale of new products. These lawsuits relate to the validity and infringement of patents or proprietary rights of third parties. We may be required to defend against allegations relating to the infringement of patent or proprietary rights of third parties. Any such litigation could, among other things:\n\u25cf\nrequire us to incur substantial expense, even if we are successful in the litigation;\n\u25cf\nrequire us to divert significant time and effort of our technical and management personnel;\n\u25cf\nresult in the loss of our rights to develop or make certain products; and\n\u25cf\nrequire us to pay substantial monetary damages or royalties in order to license proprietary rights from third parties or to satisfy judgments or to settle actual or threatened litigation.\nAlthough patent and intellectual property disputes within the orthopedic medical devices industry have often been settled through assignments, licensing or similar arrangements, costs associated with these arrangements may be substantial and could include the long-term payment of royalties. Furthermore, the required assignments or licenses may not be made available to us on acceptable terms. Accordingly, an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding or a failure to obtain necessary assignments or licenses could prevent us from manufacturing and selling some products or increase our costs to market these products.\nWe may be subject to product and other liability claims that may not be covered by insurance and could require us to pay substantial sums. Moreover, fluctuations in insurance expense could adversely affect our profitability.\nWe are subject to an inherent risk of, and adverse publicity associated with, product liability and other liability claims, whether or not such claims are valid. We maintain product liability insurance coverage in amounts and scope that we believe are reasonable and adequate. There can be no assurance, however, that product liability or other claims will not exceed our insurance coverage limits or that such insurance will continue to be available on reasonable, commercially acceptable terms, or at all. A successful product liability claim that exceeds our insurance coverage limits could require us to pay substantial sums and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nIn addition to product liability insurance coverage, we hold a number of other insurance policies, including directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance, property insurance and workers\u2019 compensation insurance. If the costs of maintaining adequate insurance coverage should increase significantly in the future, our operating results could be materially adversely impacted.\nOur allograft and mesenchymal stem cell allografts could expose us to certain risks that could disrupt our business.\nOur Biologics business markets tissue under the brand names Trinity Evolution\u00ae and Trinity ELITE\u00ae. Trinity Evolution\u00ae and Trinity ELITE\u00ae are derived from human cadaveric donors, and our ability to market the tissues depends on our supplier continuing to have access to donated human cadaveric tissue, as well as the maintenance of high standards by the supplier in its processing methodology. The supply of such donors is inherently unpredictable and can fluctuate over time. We believe that Trinity Evolution\u00ae and Trinity ELITE\u00ae are properly classified under the FDA\u2019s HCT/P regulatory paradigm and not as a medical device or as a biologic or drug. There can be no assurance that the FDA will not at some future date re-classify Trinity Evolution\u00ae and Trinity ELITE\u00ae, and the reclassification of this product from a human tissue to a medical device could have adverse consequences for us or for the supplier of this product and make it more difficult or expensive for us to conduct this business by requiring premarket clearance or approval as well as compliance with additional post-market regulatory requirements. The success of our Trinity Evolution\u00ae and Trinity ELITE\u00ae allografts will depend on these products achieving broad market acceptance, which can depend on the product achieving broad clinical acceptance, the level of third-party reimbursement and the introduction of competing technologies. Because Trinity Evolution \u00ae and Trinity Elite are classified as HCT/Ps, they can from time to time be subject to recall for safety or administrative reasons.\nOur Biologics business also distributes allograft products that are derived from human tissue harvested from cadavers that are used for bone reconstruction or repair, which are surgically implanted into the human body. We believe these allograft products are properly classified as HCT/P products and not as a medical device or a biologic or drug. There can be no assurance that the FDA would agree that this regulatory classification applies to these products and any regulatory reclassification could have adverse consequences for us or for the suppliers of these products and make it more difficult or expensive for us to conduct this business by requiring premarket clearance or approval and compliance with additional post-market regulatory requirements. Moreover, the supply of these products to us could be interrupted by the failure of our suppliers to maintain high standards in performing required donor screening and infectious disease testing of donated human tissue used in producing allograft implants. Our allograft implant business could also be adversely affected by shortages in the supply of donated human tissue or negative publicity concerning methods of recovery of tissue and product liability actions arising out of the distribution of allograft implant products.\nWe may not be able to successfully introduce new products to the market, and market opportunities that we expect to develop for our products may not be as large as we expect.\nDuring 2015, we continued to make improvements in revenues related to several new products we introduced to the market over the past three years, including the CONSTRUX\u00ae Mini PTC\u2122 PEEKTI Composite Spacer System\u2122, Phoenix\u00ae Minimally Invasive Spinal Fixation System, the Firebird\u00ae Deformity Correction System, the FORZA\u00ae Spacer System, TL-HEX TrueLok Hexapod System\u00ae, Galaxy Fixation\u00ae System, Contours LPS\u2122 (Lapidus Plating System), Centronail\u00ae Ankle Compression Nail, among others. Despite our planning, the process of developing and introducing new products (including product enhancements) is inherently complex and uncertain and involves risks, including the ability of such new products to satisfy customer needs, gain broad market acceptance (including by physicians) and obtain regulatory approvals, which can depend, among other things, on the product achieving broad clinical acceptance, the level of third-party reimbursement and the introduction of competing technologies. If the market opportunities that we expect to develop for our products, including new products, are not as large as we expect, it could adversely affect our ability to grow our business.\nGrowing our business requires that we educate and train physicians regarding the distinctive characteristics, benefits, safety, clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of our products.\nAcceptance of our products depends in part on our ability to (i) educate the medical community as to the distinctive characteristics, benefits, safety, clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of our products compared to alternative products, procedures and therapies, and (ii) train physicians in the proper use and implementation of our products. We support our sales force and distributors through specialized training workshops in which surgeons and sales specialists participate. We also produce marketing materials, including materials outlining surgical procedures, for our sales force and distributors in a variety of languages using printed, video and multimedia formats. To provide additional advanced training for surgeons, consistent with the AdvaMed Code and the Eucomed Code guidelines, we organize monthly multilingual teaching seminars in multiple locations, including our Orthofix Institute for Research, Training and Education in the North American Operations and Training Center in Lewisville, Texas. However, we may not be successful in our efforts to educate the medical community and properly train physicians. If physicians are not properly trained, they may misuse or ineffectively use our products, which may result in unsatisfactory patient outcomes, patient injury, negative publicity or lawsuits against us. In addition, a failure to educate the medical community regarding our products may impair our ability to achieve market acceptance of our products.\nWe may be adversely affected by any disruption in our information technology systems, which could adversely affect our cash flows, operating results and financial condition.\nOur operations are dependent upon our information technology systems, which encompass all of our major business functions. We rely upon such information technology systems to manage and replenish inventory, to fill and ship customer orders on a timely basis, to coordinate our sales activities across all of our products and services and to coordinate our administrative activities. A substantial disruption in our information technology systems for any prolonged time period (arising from, for example, system capacity limits from unexpected increases in our volume of business, outages or delays in our service) could result in delays in receiving inventory and supplies or filling customer orders and adversely affect our customer service and relationships. Our systems might be damaged or interrupted by natural or man-made events or by computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions affecting the global Internet. There can be no assurance that such delays, problems, or costs will not have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, operating results and financial condition.\nAs our operations grow in both size and scope, we will continuously need to improve and upgrade our systems and infrastructure while maintaining the reliability and integrity of our systems and infrastructure. An expansion of our systems and infrastructure may require us to commit substantial financial, operational and technical resources before the volume of our business increases, with no assurance that the volume of business will increase. In particular, we are currently upgrading our financial reporting system and other information technology systems as part of our Infrastructure Initiative, project Bluecore. These and any other upgrades to our systems and information technology, or new technology, now and in the future, will require that our management and resources be diverted from our core business to assist in compliance with those requirements. There can be no assurance that the time and resources our management will need to devote to these upgrades, service outages or delays due to the installation of any new or upgraded technology (and customer issues therewith), or the impact on the reliability of our data from any new or upgraded technology will not have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, operating results and financial condition.\nA significant portion of our operations run on a single Enterprise Resource Planning (\u201cERP\u201d) platform. To manage our international operations efficiently and effectively, we rely heavily on our ERP system, internal electronic information and communications systems and on systems or support services from third parties. Any of these systems are subject to electrical or telecommunications outages, computer hacking or other general system failure. It is also possible that future acquisitions will operate on different ERP systems and that we could face difficulties in integrating operational and accounting functions of new acquisitions. Difficulties in upgrading or expanding our ERP system or system-wide or local failures that affect our information processing could adversely affect our cash flows, operating results and financial condition.\nWe are dependent on third-party manufacturers for many of our products.\nWe contract with third-party manufacturers to produce most of our products, like many other companies in the medical device industry. If we or any such manufacturer fails to meet production and delivery schedules, it can have an adverse impact on our ability to sell such products. Further, whether we directly manufacture a product or utilize a third-party manufacturer, shortages and spoilage of materials, labor stoppages, product recalls, manufacturing defects and other similar events can delay production and inhibit our ability to bring a new product to market in timely fashion. For example, the supply of Trinity Evolution\u00ae and Trinity ELITE\u00ae are derived from human cadaveric donors, and our ability to market the tissues depends on our supplier continuing to have access to donated human cadaveric tissue, as well as, the maintenance of high standards by the supplier in its processing methodology. The supply of such donors is inherently unpredictable and can fluctuate over time. Further, because Trinity Evolution\u00ae and Trinity ELITE\u00ae are classified as HCT/Ps, they could from time to time be subject to recall for safety or administrative reasons.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate.\nOur quarterly operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past. Our future quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly, and we may experience losses depending on a number of factors, including the extent to which our products continue to gain or maintain market acceptance, the rate and size of expenditures incurred as we expand our domestic and establish our international sales and distribution networks, the timing and level of reimbursement for our products by third-party payors, the extent to which we are subject to government regulation or enforcement and other factors, many of which are outside our control.\nWe depend on our senior management team.\nOur success depends upon the skill, experience and performance of members of our senior management team, who have been critical to the management of our operations and the implementation of our business strategy. We do not have key man insurance on our senior management team, and the loss of one or more key executive officers could have a material adverse effect on our operations and development.\nIn order to compete, we must attract, retain and motivate key employees, and our failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIn order to compete, we must attract, retain and motivate executives and other key employees, including those in managerial, technical, sales, marketing, finance and support positions. Hiring and retaining qualified executives, engineers, technical staff and sales representatives are critical to our business, and competition for experienced employees in the medical device industry can be intense. To attract, retain and motivate qualified employees, we utilize stock-based incentive awards such as employee stock options. If the value of such stock awards does not appreciate as measured by the performance of the price of our common stock and ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit, our ability to attract, retain and motivate our employees could be adversely impacted, which could negatively affect our results of operations and/or require us to increase the amount we expend on cash and other forms of compensation.\nWe are party to numerous contractual relationships.\nWe are party to numerous contracts in the normal course of our business. We have contractual relationships with suppliers, distributors and agents, as well as service providers. In the aggregate, these contractual relationships are necessary for us to operate our business. From time to time, we amend, terminate or negotiate our contracts. We are also periodically subject to, or make claims of breach of contract, or threaten legal action relating to our contracts. These actions may result in litigation. At any one time, we have a number of negotiations under way for new or amended commercial agreements. We devote substantial time, effort and expense to the administration and negotiation of contracts involved in our business. However, these contracts may not continue in effect past their current term or we may not be able to negotiate satisfactory contracts in the future with current or new business partners.\nWe have loaned $15 million to an early stage company as part of our option to acquire it, and may not be able to recoup our investment or successfully complete the acquisition.\nOn March 4, 2015, we entered into an option agreement with eNeura, Inc., a privately held medical technology company that is developing devices for the treatment of migraines. The option agreement provides us with an exclusive option until September 2016 to acquire eNeura. In consideration for the option, (i) we paid a non-refundable $250,000 fee to eNeura, and (ii) we loaned eNeura $15 million pursuant to a convertible, secured promissory note that was issued to us.\neNeura is using the proceeds of our loan to fund product development work related to its business and to fund its ongoing operations. Although the promissory note is secured by many of eNeura\u2019s assets (including its intellectual property assets), no assurance can be made that eNeura will be able to repay the promissory note when due in the event that we do not choose to exercise our option to acquire eNeura or convert the promissory note to equity. In such an event, we could lose all or a substantial portion of our $15 million loan investment.\nFurther, while we believe that eNeura has made recent progress on product design improvements, initiating a new clinical trial, and initial U.S. commercialization efforts, no assurance can be made that eNeura\u2019s business will ultimately be successful. In particular, in the event that we ultimately exercise our option to acquire eNeura, we will need to integrate eNeura\u2019s business into our own. Such integration may involve numerous risks, including the need to successfully continue eNeura\u2019s product development, and incorporate potential products into our own sales, marketing and distribution channels. A failure to overcome these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with the acquisition could adversely affect our business, prospects and financial condition.\nTermination of our existing relationships with our independent sales representatives or distributors could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe sell our products in many countries through independent distributors. Generally, our independent sales representatives and our distributors have the exclusive right to sell our products in their respective territories and are generally prohibited from selling any products that compete with ours. The terms of these agreements vary in length, generally from one to ten years. Under the terms of our distribution agreements, each party has the right to terminate in the event of a material breach by the other party and we generally have the right to terminate if the distributor does not meet agreed sales targets or fails to make payments on time. Any termination of our existing relationships with independent sales representatives or distributors could have an adverse effect on our business unless and until commercially acceptable alternative distribution arrangements are put in place. In addition, we operate in areas of the world that have been disproportionately affected by the global recession and we bear risk that existing or future accounts receivable may be uncollected if these distributors or hospitals experience disruptions to their business that cause them to discontinue paying ongoing accounts payable or become insolvent.\nWe face risks related to foreign currency exchange rates.\nBecause some of our revenue, operating expenses, assets and liabilities are denominated in foreign currencies, we are subject to foreign exchange risks that could adversely affect our operations and reported results. To the extent that we incur expenses or earn revenue in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, any change in the values of those foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar could cause our profits to decrease or our products to be less competitive against those of our competitors. To the extent that our current assets denominated in foreign currency are greater or less than our current liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, we have potential foreign exchange exposure. The fluctuations of foreign exchange rates during 2015 have had an unfavorable impact of $15.3 million on net sales outside of the U.S. Although we seek to manage our foreign currency exposure by matching non-dollar revenues and expenses, exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the future. To minimize such exposures, we enter into currency hedges from time to time. At December 31, 2015, we had a cross-currency swap to hedge a \u20ac9.6 million foreign currency exposure.\nWe are subject to differing tax rates in several jurisdictions in which we operate.\nWe have subsidiaries in several countries. Certain of our subsidiaries sell products directly to other Orthofix subsidiaries or provide marketing and support services to other Orthofix subsidiaries. These intercompany sales and support services involve subsidiaries operating in jurisdictions with differing tax rates. Tax authorities in these jurisdictions may challenge our treatment of such intercompany transactions. If we are unsuccessful in defending our treatment of intercompany transactions, we may be subject to additional tax liability or penalty, which could adversely affect our profitability.\nWe are subject to differing customs and import/export rules in several jurisdictions in which we operate.\nWe import and export our products to and from a number of different countries around the world. These product movements involve subsidiaries and third parties operating in jurisdictions with different customs and import/export rules and regulations. Customs authorities in such jurisdictions may challenge our treatment of customs and import/export rules relating to product shipments under aspects of their respective customs laws and treaties. If we are unsuccessful in defending our treatment of customs and import/export classifications, we may be subject to additional customs duties, fines or penalties that could adversely affect our profitability.\nOur business is subject to economic, political, regulatory and other risks associated with international sales and operations.\nSince we sell our products in many different countries, our business is subject to risks associated with conducting business internationally. We anticipate that net sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total net sales. In addition, a number of our manufacturing facilities and suppliers are located outside the U.S. Accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including:\n\u25cf\nchanges in a specific country\u2019s or region\u2019s political or economic conditions;\n\u25cf\ntrade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements or other restrictive actions by foreign governments;\n\u25cf\nconsequences from changes in tax or customs laws;\n\u25cf\ndifficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations;\n\u25cf\ndiffering labor regulations;\n\u25cf\ndiffering protection of intellectual property;\n\u25cf\nunexpected changes in regulatory requirements; and\n\u25cf\napplication of the FCPA and other anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws to our operations.\nCompliance with government regulations and customer demands regarding the use of \u201cconflict minerals\u201d may result in increased costs and may have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 imposes new disclosure requirements regarding the use of certain minerals, which are mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries, known as conflict minerals. When these new requirements are implemented, they could affect the pricing, sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of semiconductor devices (including our products). There will be additional costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements, such as costs related to determining the source of any conflict minerals used in our products. Our supply chain is complex and we may be unable to verify the origins for all metals used in our products. Customers may demand that the products they purchase be free of conflict minerals. Therefore, we may encounter challenges with our customers and stockholders if we are unable to certify that our products are conflict free. The implementation of this requirement could affect the sourcing and availability of products we purchase from\nsuppliers in the future. This may reduce the number of suppliers that may be able to provide conflict free products, and may affect our ability to obtain products in sufficient quantities to meet customer demand or at competitive prices.\nWe may incur costs and undertake new debt and contingent liabilities in a search for acquisitions, and we may be unsuccessful in our search for such acquisitions or have difficulty integrating any acquired businesses or product lines.\nWe continue to search for viable acquisition candidates that would expand our market sector or global presence. We also seek additional products appropriate for current distribution channels. The search for an acquisition of another company or product line by us could result in our incurring costs from such efforts as well as the undertaking of new debt and contingent liabilities from such searches or acquisitions. Such costs may be incurred at any time and may vary in size depending on the scope of the acquisition or product transactions and may have a material impact on our results of operations.\nIn addition, we compete with other medical device companies for these opportunities, and we may be unable to consummate such acquisitions on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. To the extent we are able to make acquisitions; we may experience difficulties in integrating any acquired companies or products into our existing business, including attrition of key personnel from acquired companies or businesses, and significant costs, charges or write downs. In addition, unforeseen operating difficulties integrating acquired companies or businesses could require us to devote significant financial and managerial resources that would otherwise be available to our existing businesses. To the extent we issue additional equity in connection with acquisitions, this may dilute our existing shareholders.\nWe may incur significant costs or retain liabilities associated with disposition activity.\nWe may from time to time sell, license, assign or otherwise dispose of or divest assets, the stock of subsidiaries or individual products, product lines or technologies, which we determine are no longer desirable for us to own, some of which may be material. Any such activity could result in our incurring costs and expenses from these efforts, some of which could be significant, as well as retaining liabilities related to the assets or properties disposed of even though, for instance, the income-generating assets have been disposed of. These costs and expenses may be incurred at any time and may have a material impact on our results of operations.\nOur subsidiaries, Orthofix Holdings, Inc. and Victory Medical Limited, maintain a $125 million secured revolving credit facility that expires in August 2020.\nOn August 31, 2015, the Company, through its subsidiaries, Orthofix Holdings, Inc. and Victory Medical Limited (collectively the \u201cBorrowers\u201d), entered into a credit agreement providing for a five-year secured revolving credit facility of $125 million. This loan arrangement replaced a prior credit facility that Orthofix Holdings had entered into in 2010. At the time of implementation in August 2015, no amounts were drawn. No amounts have been drawn on the credit facility as of December 31, 2015, but the Company may draw on this facility in the future.\nThe Company and certain of its existing and future United States and United Kingdom domiciled subsidiaries (collectively, the \u201cGuarantors\u201d) are required to guarantee the repayment of the Borrowers\u2019 obligations under the 2015 Credit Agreement. The obligations of the Borrowers and each of the Guarantors with respect to the 2015 Credit Agreement are secured by a pledge of substantially all of the tangible and intangible personal property of the Borrowers and each of the Guarantors, including accounts receivable, deposit accounts, intellectual property, investment property, inventory, equipment and equity interests in their subsidiaries.\nThe credit agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, grant or permit additional liens, make investments and acquisitions, merge or consolidate with others, dispose of assets, pay dividends and distributions, repay subordinated indebtedness and enter into affiliate transactions. In addition, the credit agreement contains financial covenants requiring us on a consolidated basis to maintain, as of the last day of any fiscal quarter, a total leverage ratio of not more than 3.0 to 1.0 and an interest coverage ratio of at least 3.0 to 1.0. The credit agreement also includes events of default customary for facilities of this type, and upon the occurrence of such events of default, subject to customary cure rights, all outstanding loans under the facility may be accelerated and/or the lenders\u2019 commitments terminated.\nWe believe that we were in compliance with the negative covenants, and there were no events of default, at December 31, 2015 (and in prior periods). However, there can be no assurance that the Company would be able to meeting such financial covenants in future fiscal quarters. The failure to do so could result in an event of default under such agreement, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position.\nOur results of operations could vary as a result of the methods, estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies.\nThe methods, estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations (see Part II, Item 7A, \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d under the subheading \u201cCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d). Such methods, estimates and judgments are, by their nature, subject to substantial risks, uncertainties and assumptions, and factors may arise over time that leads us to change our methods, estimates and judgments. Changes in those methods, estimates and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations.\nValuation adjustments to \u201cgoodwill\u201d, which represents a significant portion of our total assets, may adversely affect our net income and we may never realize the full value of our intangible assets.\nA significant portion of our assets is comprised of goodwill. We may not receive the recorded value for our goodwill if we sell or liquidate our business or assets. The material concentration of goodwill increases the risk of a large charge to earnings if recoverability of goodwill is impaired, which would have an adverse effect on our net income.\nProvisions of Cura\u00e7ao law may have adverse consequences for our shareholders.\nWe were organized under the laws of the Netherlands Antilles in 1987, with our principal executive office in the Netherlands Antilles located on the island of Cura\u00e7ao. Prior to October 10, 2010, the Netherlands Antilles, together with Aruba and the Netherlands, formed the Kingdom of the Netherlands, with Cura\u00e7ao being an island territory of the Netherlands Antilles. Under a constitutional reform of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, agreed upon among the Netherlands Antilles, Aruba and the Netherlands, the Netherlands Antilles was dissolved effective October 10, 2010. Also effective October 10, 2010, Cura\u00e7ao became an individual constitutional entity within the Kingdom of the Netherlands, having its own government and laws. As a result of the constitutional reform and the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles, the Netherlands Antilles law ceased to exist and the Company is now a Cura\u00e7ao legal entity subject to Cura\u00e7ao law. Although Cura\u00e7ao has become a separate and autonomous country with its own laws and regulations, the civil and corporate Netherlands Antilles law, as they applied to the Company before October 10, 2010, did not change under the constitutional reform. In effect, Cura\u00e7ao has adopted the Netherlands Antilles civil and corporate law (to which the Company was subject) that was in effect prior to October 10, 2010.\nOur corporate affairs are therefore now governed by our Articles of Association and the corporate law of Cura\u00e7ao as laid down in Book 2 of the Cura\u00e7ao Civil Code (\u201cCCC\u201d). Although certain of the provisions of the CCC resemble certain of the provisions of the corporation laws of a number of states in the U.S., principles of law relating to such matters as the validity of corporate procedures, the fiduciary duties of management and the rights of our shareholders may differ from those that would apply if the Company were incorporated in a jurisdiction within the U.S. For example, there is no statutory right of appraisal under Cura\u00e7ao corporate law, nor is there a right for shareholders of a Cura\u00e7ao corporation to sue a corporation derivatively. In addition, we have been advised by Cura\u00e7ao counsel that it is unlikely that (1) the courts of Cura\u00e7ao would enforce judgments entered by U.S. courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws and (2) actions can be brought in Cura\u00e7ao in relation to liabilities predicated upon the U.S. federal securities laws.", "PERMNO": 78756, "SIC": 3841, "TIC": "OFIX"}
