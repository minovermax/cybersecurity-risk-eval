{"cik": "878828", "company": "WIRELESS TELECOM GROUP INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-12", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business is dependent on capital spending on data and communication networks by customers or end users of our products and reductions in such capital spending could adversely affect our business.\nOur performance is dependent on customers\u2019 or end users\u2019 capital spending for constructing, rebuilding, maintaining or upgrading data and communication networks, which can be volatile or hard to forecast. Capital spending in the communications industry is cyclical and can be curtailed or deferred on short notice. A variety of factors affect the amount of capital spending, and, therefore, our revenues and profits, including:\n\u2022 competing technologies;\n\u2022 timing and adoption of global rollout of new technologies, including 4G/LTE/5G;\n\u2022 customer specific financial or market conditions;\n\u2022 governmental budget levels and regulation;\n\u2022 demands for network services; and\n\u2022 acceptance of new services offered by our customers.\nOur customers or the end users of our products may not purchase new equipment at levels we have seen in the past or expect in the future. If our product portfolio and product development plans do not position us well to capture an increased portion of the capital spending of customers, our revenue may decline. As a result of these issues, we may not be able to maintain or increase our revenue in the future, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nWe depend on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our revenues. The loss of, or a significant decrease in business from, these customers could seriously harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe currently derive and expect to continue to derive, a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of customers. On a segment basis, client concentration may be of even greater significance. Two customers account for approximately 71% and 18%, respectively, of the Embedded Solutions segment revenues for 2018. In addition, in our Test and Measurement segment, we have one customer representing approximately 12% of the 2018 revenues for that segment. And in the Network Solutions segment, one customer accounts for 13% of the 2018 revenues for that segment. The loss of, or a significant decrease in, business from one or more of our more significant customers could seriously harm our financial condition and results of operations. We expect to continue to depend upon some of these larger customers for a significant percentage of our revenues.\nThe cyclicality of our end-user markets could harm our financial results.\nMany of the end markets we serve, including but not limited to the commercial wireless market, have historically been cyclical and have experienced periodic downturns. The factors leading to and the severity and length of a downturn are very difficult to predict and there can be no assurance that we will appropriately anticipate changes in the underlying end markets we serve or that any increased levels of business activity will continue as a trend into the future. If we fail to anticipate changes in the end markets we serve, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. We are subject to fluctuations in technology spending by existing and potential customers.\nOur industry is highly competitive and if we are not able to successfully compete, we could lose market share and our revenues could decline.\nWe operate in industries characterized by aggressive competition, rapid technological change, evolving technology standards and short product life cycles. Current and prospective customers for our products evaluate our capabilities against the merits of our direct competitors. We compete primarily on the basis of technology and performance. We also compete on price. Many of our competitors utilize similar technologies to ours and have substantially greater resources and expertise in financial, technical and marketing areas than we have. Our competitors may introduce products that are competitively priced, have increased performance or functionality or incorporate technological advances that we have not yet developed or implemented.\nTo remain competitive, we must continue to develop, market and sell new and enhanced products at competitive prices, which will require significant research and development expenditures. If we do not develop new and enhanced products or if we are not able to invest adequately in our research and development activities, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nMany of our competitors are substantially larger than we are, and have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we have. Many of these large enterprises are in a better position to withstand any significant reduction in capital spending by customers in our markets. They often have broader product lines and market focus, and may not be as susceptible to downturns in a single market. These competitors may also be able to bundle their products together to meet the needs of a particular customer, and may be capable of delivering more complete solutions than we are able to provide. To the extent large enterprises that currently do not compete directly with us choose to enter our markets by acquisition or otherwise, competition would likely intensify.\nWe are exposed to risks associated with acquisitions and investments which could cause us to incur unanticipated costs and liabilities and harm our business and results of operations.\nIn the future we may make acquisitions of, or significant investments in, businesses with complementary products, services and/or technologies. Acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022 difficulties and increased costs in connection with integration of the personnel, operations, technologies and products of acquired businesses;\n\u2022 diversion of management\u2019s attention from other operational matters;\n\u2022 the potential loss of key employees of acquired businesses;\n\u2022 lack of synergy, or the inability to realize expected synergies, resulting from the acquisition;\n\u2022 implementation or remediation of controls, procedures and policies of the acquired company;\n\u2022 failure to commercialize purchased technology;\n\u2022 liability for activities of the acquired company prior to the acquisition, including violations of law, commercial disputes, escheat and tax and other known and unknown liabilities; and\n\u2022 the impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill that could result in significant charges to operating results in future periods.\nIf we are unable to address these difficulties and challenges or other problems encountered in connection any future acquisition or investment, we might not realize the anticipated benefits of that acquisition or investment and we could incur unanticipated costs, liabilities or otherwise suffer harm to our business generally. The difficulties and challenges of successful integration of any acquired company are increased when the integration involves companies with operations or material vendors outside the United States.\nTo the extent that we pay the consideration for any future acquisitions or investments in cash or any potential earn outs, it would reduce the amount of cash available to us for other purposes. Such payments also may increase our cash flow and liquidity risk and could result in increased borrowings under our Credit Facility. See the Risk Factor titled \u201cWe have incurred indebtedness and may incur additional indebtedness.\u201d Future acquisitions or investments could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities or the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, amortization expenses or impairment charges against goodwill or intangible assets on our balance sheet, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur future success depends on our ability to anticipate and to adapt to technological changes and develop, implement and market product innovations.\nMany of our markets are characterized by advances in information processing and communications capabilities that require increased transmission speeds and greater bandwidth. These advances require ongoing improvements in the capabilities of our products. However, we may not be successful in our ongoing improvement efforts if, among other things, our products:\n\u2022 are not cost effective;\n\u2022 are not brought to market in a timely manner;\n\u2022 are not in accordance with evolving industry standards; or\n\u2022 fail to achieve market acceptance or meet customer requirements.\nThere are various competitive wireless technologies that could be a substitute for the products we sell. The failure to successfully introduce new or enhanced products on a timely and cost-competitive basis or the inability to continue to market existing products on a cost-competitive basis could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, revenues from new products may replace revenues from some of our existing products, mitigating the benefits of new product introductions and possibly resulting in excess levels of inventory.\nFurthermore, we must make long-term investments and commit significant resources before knowing whether our investments will eventually result in products that the market will accept. We must accurately forecast volumes, mix of products and configurations that meet customer requirements, and we may not succeed. If we do not succeed, we may be left with inventories of obsolete products or we may not have enough of some products available to meet customer demand, which could lead to reduced revenues and higher expenses.\nOur revenues are dependent in part on commercial upgrades of 4G and 5G wireless communications equipment, products and services. Our business may be harmed, and our investments in our technologies may not provide us an adequate return if:\n\u2022 LTE, a wireless standard, is not widely deployed or commercial deployment is delayed;\n\u2022 wireless operators delay moving customers to 4G or 5G devices;\n\u2022 wireless operators delay 4G or 5G deployments, expansions or upgrades;\n\u2022 government regulators delay the reallocation of spectrum to allow wireless operators to upgrade to 4G or 5G, which will restrict the expansion of 4G or 5G wireless connectivity;\n\u2022 wireless operators are unable to drive improvements in 4G or 5G network performance and/or capacity;\n\u2022 wireless operators and other industries using these technologies deploy other technologies; or\n\u2022 wireless operators choose to spend their capital on their core network or limit their expenditures on radio access network (RAN).\nOur business is dependent on our ability to increase our share of components sold and to continue to drive the adoption of our products and services into LTE, 4G and 5G wireless networks. If commercial deployment of our technologies, and upgrade of subscribers to 4G or 5G wireless communications equipment, products and services using our technologies do not continue or are delayed, our revenues could be negatively impacted, and our business could suffer.\nFurther, if we do not have competitively priced, market accepted products available to meet the wireless operators planned roll-out of 5G wireless communications systems, we may miss a significant opportunity and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted.\nOur future research and development projects might not be successful.\nThe successful development of telecommunications products can be affected by many factors. Products that appear to be promising at their early phases of research and development may fail to be commercialized for various reasons, including the failure to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals. There is no assurance that any of our future research and development projects will be successful or completed within the anticipated time frame or budget or that we will receive the necessary approvals from relevant authorities, customers, or prospective customers, for the production of these newly developed products, or that these newly developed products will achieve commercial success. Even if such products can be successfully commercialized, they may not achieve the level of market acceptance that we expect.\nDependence on contract manufacturing and outsourcing other portions of our supply chain might adversely affect our ability to bring products to market and could damage our reputation.\nAs part of our efforts to streamline operations and to minimize costs, we outsource aspects of our manufacturing processes and other functions and continue to evaluate additional outsourcing. If our contract manufacturers or other outsourcers fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels, our ability to bring products to market and our reputation could suffer. For example, during a market upturn, our contract manufacturers might be unable to meet our demand requirements, which could preclude us from fulfilling our customers\u2019 orders on a timely basis. The ability of these manufacturers to perform is largely outside of our control. Additionally, changing or replacing our contract manufacturers or other outsourcers could cause disruptions or delays.\nIf our products do not perform as promised, we could experience increased costs, lower margins and harm to our reputation.\nThe failure of our products to perform as promised could result in increased costs, lower margins and harm to our reputation. We may not be able to anticipate all of the possible performance or reliability problems that could arise with our existing or new products, which could result in significant product liability or warranty claims. In addition, any defects found in our products could result in a loss of revenues or market share, failure to achieve market acceptance, injury to our reputation, indemnification claims, litigation, increased insurance costs and increased service costs, any of which could discourage customers from purchasing our products and materially harm our business.\nUncertainty over global tariffs, or the financial impact of tariffs, may negatively affect our results.\nRecent changes in U.S. domestic and global tariff frameworks have increased our costs of producing goods and resulted in additional risks to our supply chain. Additional tariff changes are possible. We are engaged in efforts to mitigate tariff increases, but there is no assurance we will be successful. Further, uncertainties about future tariff changes could result in mitigation actions that prove to be detrimental to our business.\nShortages or delays of supplies for component parts could adversely affect our operating results until alternate sources can be developed.\nOur operations are dependent on the ability of suppliers to deliver quality components, devices and subassemblies in time to meet critical manufacturing and distribution schedules. If we experience any constrained supply of component parts, such constraints, if persistent, could adversely affect operating results until alternate sourcing can be developed. There could be an increased risk of supplier constraints in periods where we are increasing production volume to meet customer demands. Volatility in the prices of these component parts, an inability to secure enough components at reasonable prices to build new products in a timely manner in the quantities and configurations demanded or, conversely, a temporary oversupply of these parts, could adversely affect our future operating results.\nThe testing and use of electronic communications equipment and the accurate transmission of information entail a risk of product liability claims being asserted by customers and third parties.\nClaims may be asserted against us by end-users of any of our products for liability due to a defective or malfunctioning device made by us, and we could be subject to corresponding litigation should one or more of our products fail to perform or meet certain minimum requirements. Such a claim and corresponding litigation could result in substantial costs, diversion of resources and management attention, termination of customer contracts and harm to our reputation.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts, and failure to address and comply with these laws and regulations could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers and subjecting us to civil and criminal penalties.\nWe have agreements relating to the sale of our products to U.S. government entities and, as a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the U.S. government. The laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts. For example, many government contracts contain pricing terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts. We are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts. A failure to comply with these regulations might result in suspension of these contracts, or civil and criminal penalties.\nWe could be subject to significant costs related to environmental contamination from past operations, and environmental contamination caused by ongoing operations could subject us to substantial liabilities in the future.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws, ordinances and regulations that limit discharges into the environment, establish standards for the handling, generation, use, emission, release, discharge, treatment, storage and disposal of, or exposure to, hazardous materials, substances and waste, and require cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater.\nIn 1982, Boonton and the NJDEP agreed upon a plan to correct ground water contamination at a site previously leased by the Company\u2019s Boonton operations, pursuant to which wells have been installed by Boonton. The plan contemplates that the wells will be operated and that soil and water samples will be taken and analyzed until such time that contamination levels are satisfactory to the NJDEP. In 2014, the Company received approval for a groundwater permit from the NJDEP to carry out the final remedial action work plan and report. Under the final phase of the plan, there will be monitoring and testing at the site. We cannot be assured that concentrations of contaminants at the site will decrease.\nThe Company could be subject to significant future liabilities and may incur significant future expenditures if further contaminants from Boonton\u2019s testing are identified and the NJDEP requires additional remediation activities. Management estimates that future monitoring and testing costs will be approximately $35,000 through 2027. The Company will continue to be liable under the plan, in all future years, until such time as the NJDEP releases the Company from all obligations.\nCertain of our products and our business are subject to ITAR, Export Administration Regulations, Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other U.S. and foreign government laws, regulations, policies and practices, and our failure to comply with such regulations could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur international revenues, for which we also use foreign representatives and consultants, are subject to U.S. laws, regulations and policies, including the ITAR and the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, and other export laws and regulations, as well as foreign government laws, regulations and procurement policies and practices which may differ from the U.S. government regulations in this regard.\nCompliance with the directives of the U.S. Department of State may result in substantial legal and other expenses and the diversion of management time. In the event that a determination is made that we or any entity we have acquired has violated the ITAR with respect to any matters, we may be subject to substantial monetary penalties that we are unable to quantify at this time, and/or suspension or revocation of our export privileges and criminal sanctions, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe can give no assurance that under either the ITAR or the EAR we will continue to be successful in obtaining the necessary licenses and authorizations or that certain revenues will not be prevented or delayed due to compliance issues related to the ITAR or the EAR.\nWe are also subject to, and must comply with, the FCPA and similar world-wide anti-corruption laws, including the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010. These acts generally prohibit both us and our third party intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of acquiring or retaining business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment. We are required as well to maintain adequate record-keeping and internal accounting practices to fully and accurately reflect our transactions. We operate in many parts of the world that have experienced government corruption. In certain circumstances, the FCPA and our programs and policies may conflict with local customs and practices. If we or any of our local intermediaries have failed to comply with the requirements of the FCPA, governmental authorities in the United States could seek to impose severe criminal and civil penalties. The assertion of violations of the FCPA or other anti-corruption laws could disrupt our business and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to various other governmental regulations, compliance with which could cause us to incur significant expenses, and if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain regulations, we could be forced to recall products and cease their distribution, and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties.\nOur business is subject to various other significant international, federal, state and local regulations, including but not limited to health and safety, packaging, product content and labor regulations. These regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. We may be required to incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations or to remedy violations of these regulations. Any failure by us to comply with applicable government regulations could also result in cessation of our operations or portions of our operations, product recalls or impositions of fines and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations.\nThe loss of key personnel could adversely affect our ability to remain competitive; our development of new and upgraded products could be adversely impacted by our inability to hire or retain personnel with appropriate technical abilities.\nWe believe that the continued service of our executive officers will be important to our future growth and competitiveness. However, other than the employment agreement we entered into with Mr. Whelan, Chief Executive Officer, we currently do not have any other employment agreements with our executive officers. We cannot provide assurance that any named executive officer will remain employed by us. Moreover, the design and manufacture of our products require substantial technical capabilities in many disparate disciplines, from engineering, mechanics and computer science to electronics and mathematics. We believe that the continued employment of key members of our technical and sales staffs will be important to us but, as with our executive officers, we cannot assure you that they will remain employed by us.\nFurthermore, our ability to research and develop new technologies and products, or upgraded versions of existing products, will depend, in part, on our ability to hire personnel with knowledge and skills that our current personnel do not have. If we are unable to hire or retain such qualified personnel, our revenues could be negatively impacted, and our business could suffer.\nWe rely on manufacturer\u2019s representatives to sell our products to key large accounts and the loss of a key manufacturers\u2019 representative could have a material impact on our revenues\nOur products are sold through a small in-house direct sales force as well as a network of industry specific manufacturers\u2019 representatives that have established relationships with our largest customers. Our arrangements with our manufacturers\u2019 representatives generally can be canceled by either party with advance written notice. The loss of a manufacturers\u2019 representative could result in a material decline in revenues.\nThird parties could claim that we are infringing on their intellectual property rights which could result in substantial costs, diversion of significant managerial resources and significant harm to our reputation.\nThe industries in which our company operates are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent litigation based on allegations of patent infringement. From time to time, third parties may assert patent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies in various jurisdictions that are important to our business. Defending claims, including claims without merit, requires allocation of resources, including personnel and capital, which could adversely impact our results of operations. A successful claim of infringement against us could result in our being required to pay significant damages, enter into costly license agreements, or stop the sale of certain products, which could adversely affect our net revenues, gross margins and expenses and harm our future prospects.\nWe use specialized technologies and know-how to design, develop and manufacture our products. Our inability to protect our intellectual property could hurt our competitive position, harm our reputation and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe believe that our intellectual property, including its methodologies, is critical to our success and competitive position. We rely on a combination of U.S. and foreign patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property against unauthorized use by third parties, our reputation among existing and potential customers could be damaged and our competitive position adversely affected.\nAttempts may be made to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Accordingly, we may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our technology or deter others from developing similar technology. Our strategies to deter misappropriation could be undermined if:\n\u2022 the proprietary nature or protection of our methodologies is not recognized in the United States or foreign countries;\n\u2022 third parties misappropriate our proprietary methodologies and such misappropriation is not detected; and\n\u2022 competitors create applications similar to ours but which do not technically infringe on our legally protected rights.\nIf these risks materialize, we could be required to spend significant amounts to defend our rights and to divert critical managerial resources. In addition, our proprietary methodologies could decline in value or our rights to them could become unenforceable. If any of the foregoing were to occur, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nWe have incurred indebtedness and may incur additional indebtedness.\nOn February 16, 2017, we obtained an asset-based lending agreement with a bank. We may incur additional indebtedness in the future.\nThe future incurrence of indebtedness, among other things, could:\n\u2022 make it difficult to make payments on our current indebtedness and our other obligations;\n\u2022 make it difficult to obtain other necessary financing;\n\u2022 require the dedication of a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to service the indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of cash flow available for other purposes, including capital expenditures; and\n\u2022 limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we compete.\nRestrictive covenants in the agreement governing our credit facility could restrict our ability to pursue business strategies.\nThe agreement governing our current credit facility limits our ability, among other things, to: incur additional secured indebtedness; incur liens; pay dividends; enter into transactions with our affiliates; and sell assets. In addition, our credit facility contains financial and other restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that might be in our long term best interest, such as, subject to permitted exceptions, making capital expenditures in excess of certain thresholds, investments and acquisitions, and loans and other advances to affiliates. Our failure to comply with financial and other restrictive covenants could result in an event of default, which if not cured or waived, could result in the lenders requiring immediate payment of all outstanding borrowings or foreclosing on collateral pledged to them to secure the indebtedness.\nOur business and operations could suffer in the event of security breaches.\nAttempts by others to gain unauthorized access to information technology systems are becoming more sophisticated and are sometimes successful. These attempts, which might be related to industrial or other espionage, include covertly introducing malware to our computers and networks and impersonating authorized users, among others. We seek to detect and investigate all security incidents and to prevent their recurrence, but in some cases, we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. The theft, unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property and/or confidential business information could harm our competitive position, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business. To the extent that any security breach results in inappropriate disclosure of our customers\u2019 or licensees\u2019 confidential information, we may incur liability as a result. In addition, we might be required to devote significant additional resources to the security of our information technology systems.\nWe rely on our information technology systems to manage numerous aspects of our business and a disruption of these systems could adversely affect our business.\nOur information technology, or IT, systems are an integral part of our business. We depend on our IT systems for scheduling, sales order entry, purchasing, materials management, accounting, and production functions. Our IT systems also allow us to ship products to our customers on a timely basis, maintain cost-effective operations and provide a high level of customer service. Some of our systems are not fully redundant, and our disaster recovery planning does not account for all eventualities. A serious disruption to our IT systems could significantly limit our ability to manage and operate our business efficiently, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nEnvironmental and other disasters, such as flooding, large earthquakes, hurricanes, volcanic eruptions or nuclear or other disasters, or a combination thereof, may negatively impact our business.\nAlthough we manufacture our products in New Jersey, we both source and ship our products globally. Environmental and other disasters could cause disruption to our supply chain or impede our ability to ship product to certain regions of the world. There can be no assurance that environmental and/or other such natural disasters will not have an adverse impact on our business in the future.\nOur operating results may suffer because of our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nSubstantially all of our sales contracts with our U.S. and international based customers provide for payment in U.S. dollars. A strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other foreign currencies could increase the effective cost of our products to our international customers as their functional currency is typically not the U.S. dollar. This could have a potential adverse effect on our ability to increase or maintain average selling prices of our products to our foreign-based customers.\nOur exposure to the currency fluctuations increased as a result of the acquisition of CommAgility. Our future revenue and expenses may be subject to volatility due to exchange rate fluctuations that could result in foreign exchange gains and losses associated with foreign currency transactions and the translation of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies.\nThe success of our ability to grow revenues and develop relationships in Europe and Asia may be limited by risks related to conducting business in European and Asian markets.\nPart of our strategy is to increase revenues and build our relationships in European and Asian markets. Risks inherent in marketing, selling and developing relationships in European and Asian markets include those associated with:\n\u2022 economic conditions in European and Asian markets, including the impact of recessions in European and Asian economies and fluctuations in the relative values of the U.S. dollar, the Euro and Asian currencies;\n\u2022 taxes and fees imposed by European and Asian governments that may increase the cost of products and services;\n\u2022 greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection and longer collection periods;\n\u2022 seasonal reductions in business activities in some parts of the world;\n\u2022 laws and regulations imposed by individual countries and by the European Union, particularly with respect to intellectual property, license requirements and environmental requirements; and\n\u2022 political and economic instability, terrorism and war.\nIn addition, European and Asian intellectual property laws are different than and might not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do U.S. intellectual property laws, and we will have to ensure that our intellectual property is adequately protected in foreign jurisdictions and in the United States. If we do not adequately protect our intellectual property rights, competitors could use our proprietary technologies in non-protected jurisdictions and put us at a competitive disadvantage.\nPolitical and economic uncertainty arising from the outcome of the referendum on the membership of the United Kingdom in the European Union could adversely impact our financial results.\nIn June 2016, a majority of voters in the U.K. elected to withdraw from the European Union (E.U.) in a national referendum (also referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d). CommAgility is located in the U.K. The announcement of Brexit caused significant volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations that resulted in the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies in which we conduct business, including the British pound.\nAs a result of the referendum being passed into law, a negotiation process to determine the future terms of the U.K.\u2019s relationship with the E.U. is ongoing, including the terms of trade between the U.K. and the E.U. The effects of Brexit will depend on any agreements the U.K. makes to retain access to E.U. markets either during a transitional period or more permanently. The measures could potentially disrupt the markets we serve and may cause us to lose customers, suppliers and employees. Additionally, disruptions and uncertainty caused by Brexit may cause our customers to closely monitor their costs and reduce their spending budget on our products and services. Brexit may also lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the U.K. determines which E.U. laws to replace or replicate. Any of these effects of Brexit, among others, could adversely affect our business, financial condition or future results.\nOur results of operations could be affected by changes in tax-related matters.\nA number of factors could cause our tax rate to increase, including a change in the jurisdictions in which our profits are earned and taxed; a change in the mix of profits from those jurisdictions; changes in available tax credits; changes in applicable tax rates; changes in accounting principles. We have deferred tax assets on our balance sheet. Changes in applicable tax laws and regulations or in our business performance could affect our ability to realize those deferred tax assets, which could also affect our results of operations.\nOur stock price is volatile and the trading volume in our common stock is less than that of other larger companies in the wireless and advanced communications industries.\nThe market price of our common stock has experienced significant volatility and may continue to be subject to rapid swings in the future. From January 1, 2015 to February 22, 2019, the trading prices of our stock have ranged from $1.30 to $3.21 per share. There are several factors which could affect the price of our common stock unrelated to our financial performance, including announcements of technological innovations for new commercial products by us or our competitors, developments concerning propriety rights, new or revised governmental regulation or general conditions in the market for our products, and the entrance of additional competitors into our markets.\nAlthough our common stock is listed for trading on the NYSE American, the trading volume in our common stock is less than that of other, larger companies in the wireless and advanced communications industries. Traditionally, the trading volume of our common stock has been limited. For example, for the 90 trading days ending on February 12, 2019, the average daily trading volume\nwas approximately 21,000 shares per day and ranged from between 100 shares per day and approximately 107,600 shares per day. Furthermore, we only have 21,300,252 shares of common stock outstanding as of the date of this report. A public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers and sellers of our common stock at any given time. Because of our limited trading volume, holders of our common stock may not be able to sell quickly any significant number of such shares, and any attempted sales of a large number of our shares will likely have a material adverse impact on the price of our common stock.\nNew Jersey corporate law may delay or prevent a transaction that stockholders would view as favorable.\nWe are subject to the New Jersey Shareholders\u2019 Protection Act, which could delay or prevent a change of control of us. In general, that Act prevents a shareholder owning 10% or more of a New Jersey public corporation\u2019s outstanding voting stock from engaging in business combinations with that corporation for five years following the date the shareholder acquired 10% or more of the corporation\u2019s outstanding voting stock, unless board approval is obtained prior to the time that the shareholder reaches the 10% threshold.\nFailure to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Sarbanes-Oxley could have a material adverse effect on our business and common stock price.\nAs a public company with SEC reporting obligations, we are required to document and test our internal control procedures to satisfy the requirements of Section 404(a) of Sarbanes-Oxley, which require annual assessments by management of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. As a smaller reporting company, we are exempt from the auditor attestation requirement of Section 404(b) of Sarbanes-Oxley.\nDuring the course of our assessment, we may identify deficiencies that we are unable to remediate in a timely manner. Testing and maintaining our internal control over financial reporting may also divert management\u2019s attention from other matters that are important to the operation of our business. We may not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404(a) of Sarbanes-Oxley. If we conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective, we cannot be certain as to the timing of completion of our evaluation, testing and remediation actions or its effect on our operations. Moreover, any material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting may impede our ability to file timely and accurate reports with the SEC. Any of the above could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information or our common stock listing on the NYSE American exchange to be suspended or terminated, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nThe Company is subject to compliance with the policies and procedures of the NYSE American Exchange with respect to continued listing on the stock exchange and our failure to maintain our listing would make trades in our securities difficult for shareholders.\nIn considering whether a security warrants continued trading and/or listing on the NYSE American Exchange, many factors are taken into account, such as the degree of investor interest in the company, its prospects for growth, the reputation of its management, the degree of commercial acceptance of its products, and whether its securities have suitable characteristics for auction market trading. Thus, any developments which substantially reduce the size of a company, the nature and scope of its operations, the value or amount of its securities available for the market, or the number of holders of its securities, might occasion a review of continued listing by the Exchange. Moreover, events such as the sale, destruction, loss or abandonment of a substantial portion of a company\u2019s business, the inability to continue its business, steps towards liquidation, or repurchase or redemption of its securities, may also give rise to such a review. The loss of our listing on the Exchange could have a material adverse effect on our shareholders\u2019 ability to sell our shares or for others to purchase our shares. This could have an adverse effect on the market price of our stock.\nWe incur significant costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management devotes substantial time to compliance initiatives.\nWe have incurred and will continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses as a public company, including costs resulting from public company reporting obligations under the Exchange Act and regulations regarding corporate governance practices. The listing requirements of the NYSE American require that we satisfy certain corporate governance requirements relating to director independence, distributing annual and interim reports, stockholder meetings, stockholder approvals and voting, and soliciting proxies. Our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to ensuring compliance with all of these requirements.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding our stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock might be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If any analysts issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding us, our business model, products or stock performance, our stock price could decline.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThe statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K that are not historical facts, including, without limitation, the statements under \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d are forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
