Risk Factors\nCarefully consider the following risk factors and all other information contained in this annual report before making an investment decision with respect to our common stock. Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. If any of the following risks actually occur, we may not be able to conduct our business as currently planned and our financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected. See PART I \u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information\u201d at the beginning of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nEconomic conditions and unemployment rates may adversely affect consumer spending and may significantly harm our business. The success of our business depends to a significant extent upon the level of consumer spending. A number of factors may affect the level of consumer spending on merchandise that we offer, including, among other things:\n\u00b7 general economic, industry and weather conditions;\n\u00b7 unemployment trends and salaries and wage rates;\n\u00b7 energy costs, which affect gasoline and home heating prices;\n\u00b7 the level of consumer debt;\n\u00b7 consumer credit availability;\n\u00b7 real estate values and foreclosure rates;\n\u00b7 consumer confidence in future economic conditions;\n\u00b7 interest rates;\n\u00b7 health care costs;\n\u00b7 tax rates and policies; and\n\u00b7 war, terrorism, other hostilities and security concerns.\nThe merchandise we sell generally consists of discretionary items. Adverse economic conditions and unemployment rates, and any related decrease in consumer confidence and spending may result in reduced consumer demand for discretionary items. Any decrease in consumer demand could reduce traffic in our stores, limit the prices we can charge for our products and force us to take inventory markdowns, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Reduced demand may also require increased selling and promotional expenses. Reduced demand and increased competition could increase the need to close underperforming stores, which could result in higher than anticipated closing costs.\nWe face significant competition in our markets and we may be unable to compete favorably. The retail footwear industry is highly competitive with few barriers to entry. We compete primarily with department stores, shoe stores, sporting goods stores, online retailers and mass merchandisers. Many of our competitors are significantly larger and have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do. Economic pressures on or bankruptcies of our competition could result in increased pricing pressures. This competition could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition in the future.\nFailure to successfully manage and execute our marketing initiatives could have a negative impact on our business. Our success and growth is partially dependent on generating customer traffic in order to gain sales momentum in our stores and drive traffic to our website. Successful marketing efforts require the ability to reach customers through their desired mode of communication, utilizing various media outlets. Media placement decisions are generally made months in advance of the scheduled release date. Our inability to accurately predict our consumers\u2019 preferences, to utilize their desired mode of communication, or to ensure availability of advertised products could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nOur failure to identify fashion trends could result in lower sales, higher markdowns and lower gross profits. Our success depends upon our ability to anticipate and react to the fashion tastes of our customers and provide merchandise that satisfies consumer demand. Our failure to anticipate, identify or react appropriately to changes in consumer fashion preferences may result in lower sales, higher markdowns to reduce excess inventories and lower gross profits. Conversely, if we fail to anticipate or react to consumer demand for our products, we may experience inventory shortages, which would result in lost sales and could negatively affect our customer goodwill, our brand image and our profitability. Moreover, our business relies on continuous changes in fashion preferences. Stagnating consumer preferences could also result in lower sales and would require us to take higher markdowns to reduce excess inventories.\nA failure to increase sales at our existing stores may adversely affect our stock price and affect our results of operations. A number of factors have historically affected, and will continue to affect, our comparable store sales results, including:\n\u00b7 competition;\n\u00b7 timing of holidays including sales tax holidays;\n\u00b7 general regional and national economic conditions;\n\u00b7 inclement weather and/or unseasonable weather patterns;\n\u00b7 consumer trends, such as less disposable income due to the impact of higher prices on consumer goods;\n\u00b7 fashion trends;\n\u00b7 changes in our merchandise mix;\n\u00b7 our ability to efficiently distribute merchandise;\n\u00b7 timing and type of, and customer response to, sales events, promotional activities or other advertising;\n\u00b7 the effectiveness of our inventory management;\n\u00b7 new merchandise introductions; and\n\u00b7 our ability to execute our business strategy effectively.\nOur comparable store sales results have fluctuated in the past, and we believe such fluctuations may continue. The unpredictability of our comparable store sales may cause our revenue and results of operations to vary from quarter to quarter, and an unanticipated decline in revenues or operating income may cause our stock price to fluctuate significantly.\nWe would be adversely affected if our distribution or information technology operations were disrupted. We currently operate a single, 410,000 square foot distribution center in Evansville, Indiana. Virtually all merchandise received by our stores is and will be shipped through our distribution center. During fiscal 2014, we began fulfilling our e-commerce orders primarily from our store locations and suspended utilization of a third party fulfillment agent for our e-commerce orders. During peak sales periods, e-commerce orders for certain key items and promotional product are fulfilled from our distribution center. Our corporate computer network is essential to our distribution process. If our distribution center is shut down for any reason, such as a natural disaster, power outage or terrorist attack, or if our information technology systems do not operate effectively, or if we are the target of attacks or security breaches, we could incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with distributing our products to our stores. Our insurance only covers costs relating to specified, limited matters such as a shutdown due to fire and windstorms, as well as certain cyber security incidents, but does not cover other events such as acts of war or terrorist attacks. Even in the event of a shutdown due to covered matters, we cannot assure you that our insurance will be sufficient, or that the insurance proceeds will be paid to us in a timely fashion. Shutdowns or information technology disruptions could have an adverse effect on our operating and financial performance.\nFailure to protect the integrity and security of individually identifiable data of our customers and employees could expose us to litigation and damage our reputation. We receive and maintain certain personal, sensitive and confidential information about our customers, vendors and employees. The collection and use of this information is regulated at the international, federal and state levels, and is subject to certain contractual restrictions in third party contracts. Although we have implemented processes to collect and protect the integrity and security of this personal information, there can be no assurance that this information will not be obtained by unauthorized persons, or collected or used inappropriately. If our security and information systems or the systems of our employees or\nexternal business associates are compromised or our employees or external business associates fail to comply with these laws and regulations and this information is obtained by unauthorized persons, or collected or used inappropriately, it could negatively affect our reputation, as well as our operations and financial results, and could result in litigation or regulatory action against us or the imposition of costs, fines or other penalties. As privacy and information security laws and regulations change, we may incur additional costs to remain in compliance.\nWe outsource certain business processes to third-party vendors and have certain business relationships that subject us to risks, including disruptions in business and increased costs. We outsource some of our business processes to third party vendors. We make a diligent effort to ensure that all providers of these outsourced services are observing proper internal control practices; however, there are no guarantees that failures will not occur. Failure of third parties to provide adequate services or our inability to arrange for alternative providers on favorable terms in a timely manner could disrupt our business, increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business and our financial results.\nFailure to maintain positive brand perception and recognition could have a negative impact on our business. Maintaining a good reputation is critical to our business. The considerable expansion in the use of social media over recent years has increased the risk that our reputation could be negatively impacted in a short amount of time. If we are unable to quickly and effectively respond to any incidents negatively impacting our reputation, we may suffer declines in customer loyalty and traffic and we may experience vendor relationship issues and other issues, all of which could negatively affect our financial results.\nWe will require significant funds to implement our growth strategy and meet our other liquidity needs. We cannot assure you that we will continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or obtain sufficient borrowings under our existing credit facility to finance our growth strategy and meet our other liquidity needs. In fiscal 2015, capital expenditures are expected to range from $23 million to $24 million. Our actual costs may be greater than anticipated. We also require working capital to support inventory for our existing stores. Failure to generate or raise sufficient funds may require us to modify, delay or abandon some of our future growth or expenditure plans. We utilize our existing credit facility to issue merchandise and special purpose standby letters of credit as well as to fund working capital requirements, as needed. Significant decreases in cash flow from operations could result in our borrowing under the credit facility to fund operational needs. If we borrow funds under our credit facility and interest rates materially increase from present levels, our results could be adversely affected.\nVarious risks associated with our e-commerce business may adversely affect our business and results of operations. We launched our e-commerce business during the third quarter of 2011, selling shoes and related accessories through our website at www.shoecarnival.com. During the third quarter of fiscal 2014, we enabled 250 stores with the capability of fulfilling e-commerce orders on a daily basis and suspended utilization of a third party fulfillment agent for our e-commerce orders. We also fulfill e-commerce orders from our distribution center during peak periods. Although our e-commerce operations are not at this time material in relation to our total sales, we anticipate that the percentage of our sales through our e-commerce site will grow and thus the risks associated with these operations could have an impact on our overall operations. Our e-commerce operations are subject to numerous risks, including unanticipated operating problems, reliance on third party computer hardware, software and service providers, and the need to invest in additional computer systems. Any significant interruptions in the operations of these third party providers, over which we have no control, could have a material adverse effect on our e-commerce business. Our e-commerce operations involve additional potential risks that could have an impact on our results of operations including hiring, retaining and training personnel to conduct our e-commerce operations, diversion of sales from our stores, our ability to manage any upgrades or other technological changes, exposure to potential liability for online content, risks related to the failure of the computer systems that operate our e-commerce site and its related support systems, including computer viruses, telecommunication failures and cyber-attacks and break-ins and similar disruptions, and security risks related to our electronic processing and transmission of confidential customer information. There can be no assurance that our e-commerce operations will achieve growing sales and profitability.\nAn increase in the cost or a disruption in the flow of imported goods may decrease our sales and profits. We rely on imported goods to sell in our stores. Substantially all of the footwear product we sell is manufactured overseas, including the merchandise we import directly from overseas manufacturers and the merchandise we purchase from\ndomestic vendors. The primary footwear manufacturers are located in China, East Asia, Bangladesh, Brazil and Europe. A disruption in the flow of imported merchandise or an increase in the cost of those goods may decrease our sales and profits. In addition, we do not control our vendors or their labor and business practices. The violation of labor, product safety or other laws by one of our vendors could have an adverse effect on our business.\nIf imported merchandise becomes more expensive or unavailable, the transition to alternative sources may not occur in time to meet our demands. Products from alternative sources may be of lesser quality and more expensive than those we currently import. Other risks associated with our use of imported goods include:\n\u00b7 disruptions in the flow of imported goods because of factors such as electricity or raw material shortages, work stoppages, strikes, political unrest and natural disasters;\n\u00b7 problems with oceanic shipping, including shipping container shortages and piracy;\n\u00b7 port congestion at arrival ports causing delays;\n\u00b7 additional oceanic shipping costs to reach non-congested ports;\n\u00b7 inland transit costs and delays resulting from port congestion;\n\u00b7 economic crises and international disputes;\n\u00b7 currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u00b7 increases in the cost of purchasing or shipping foreign merchandise resulting from the failure to maintain normal trade relations with source countries;\n\u00b7 import duties, import quotas and other trade sanctions;\n\u00b7 increases in shipping rates imposed by the trans-Pacific shipping cartel; and\n\u00b7 compliance with the laws and regulations, and changes to such laws and regulations, in the United States and the countries where our manufacturers are located, including but not limited to requirements relating to shipping security, product safety testing and environmental requirements.\nWe may not be able to successfully execute our growth strategy, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We intend to open new stores as a part of our growth strategy. We may not be able to open all of the new stores contemplated by our growth strategy and the new stores that we open may not be as profitable as existing stores.\nThe complexity of our operations and management responsibilities will increase as we grow. Our growth strategy requires that we continue to expand and improve our operating and financial systems and expand, train and manage our employee base. In addition, as we open new stores, we may be unable to hire a sufficient number of qualified store personnel or successfully integrate the new stores into our business.\nThe success of our growth strategy will depend on a number of other factors, many of which are out of our control, including, among other things:\n\u00b7 our ability to locate suitable store sites and negotiate store leases (for new stores and renewals) on favorable terms;\n\u00b7 the acceptance of the Shoe Carnival concept in new markets;\n\u00b7 our ability to provide adequate distribution to support growth;\n\u00b7 our ability to source sufficient levels of inventory to meet the needs of new stores;\n\u00b7 particularly in new markets, our ability to open a sufficient number of new stores to provide the critical mass needed for efficient advertising and effective brand recognition;\n\u00b7 the availability of financing for capital expenditures and working capital requirements;\n\u00b7 our ability to improve costs and timing associated with opening new stores; and\n\u00b7 the impact of new stores on sales or profitability of existing stores in the same market.\nDue to the risks involved, we may be unable to open new stores at the rates expected. If we fail to successfully implement our growth strategy, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe depend on our key suppliers for merchandise and advertising support and the loss of key suppliers could adversely affect our business. Our business depends upon our ability to purchase fashionable, name brand and\nother merchandise at competitive prices from our suppliers. In fiscal 2014, two branded suppliers, Nike, Inc. and Skechers USA, Inc., collectively accounted for approximately 40% of our net sales. Nike, Inc. accounted for approximately 29% of our net sales and Skechers USA, Inc. accounted for approximately 11%. Name brand suppliers also provide us with cooperative advertising and visual merchandising funds. A loss of any of our key suppliers in certain product categories or our inability to obtain name brand or other merchandise from suppliers at competitive prices could have a material adverse effect on our business. As is common in the industry, we do not have any long-term contracts with our suppliers.\nOur quarterly operating results will fluctuate due to seasonality and other factors. Our quarterly results of operations have fluctuated, and are expected to continue to fluctuate in the future, primarily as a result of seasonal variances and the timing of sales and costs associated with opening new stores. Other factors that may affect our quarterly results of operations include:\n\u00b7 fashion trends;\n\u00b7 calendar shifts of holiday or seasonal periods;\n\u00b7 the effectiveness of our inventory management;\n\u00b7 weather conditions;\n\u00b7 changes in general economic conditions and consumer spending patterns; and\n\u00b7 actions of competitors or co-tenants.\nWe have three distinct peak selling periods: Easter, back-to-school and Christmas. To prepare for our peak shopping seasons, we must order and keep in stock significantly more merchandise than we would carry during other parts of the year. Any unanticipated decrease in demand for our products during these peak shopping seasons could require us to sell excess inventory at a substantial markdown, which could reduce our net sales and gross margins and negatively affect our profitability. Our operating results depend significantly upon the sales generated during these periods.\nWe also increase our inventory levels to offer styles particularly suited for the relevant season, such as sandals in the early summer season and boots during the winter season. If the weather conditions for a particular season vary significantly from those typical for such season, such as an unusually cold early summer or an unusually warm winter, consumer demand for the seasonally appropriate merchandise that we have available in our stores could be adversely affected and negatively impact net sales and margins. Lower demand for seasonally appropriate merchandise may leave us with an excess inventory of our seasonally appropriate products, forcing us to sell these products at significantly discounted prices and adversely affecting our net sales margins and operating cash flow. Conversely, if weather conditions permit us to sell our seasonal product early in the season, this may reduce inventory levels needed to meet our customers\u2019 needs later in that same season. Consequently, our results of operations are highly dependent on somewhat predictable weather conditions and our ability to react to changes in weather conditions. If our future quarterly results fail to meet the expectations of research analysts, then the market price of our common stock could decline substantially.\nIf our long-lived assets become impaired, we may need to record significant non-cash impairment charges. Periodically, we review our long-lived assets for impairment whenever economic events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Significant negative industry or general economic trends, disruptions to our business and unexpected significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets (such as store relocations or closures) may result in impairment charges. Any such impairment charges, if significant, would adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.\nWe are subject to periodic litigation and other regulatory proceedings, which could result in the unexpected expenditure of time and resources. We are a defendant from time to time in lawsuits and regulatory actions relating to our business. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings. An unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, regardless of the outcome of any litigation or regulatory proceedings, such proceedings are expensive and will require that we devote substantial resources and executive time to defend, thereby diverting management\u2019s attention and resources that are needed to successfully run our business.\nOur failure to manage key executive succession and retention and to continue to attract qualified personnel could adversely affect our business. Our success depends largely on the continued service of our executive management team. Our business would be adversely affected if we fail to adequately plan for the succession and retention of our executive management team. While we have succession plans in place for members of our executive management team, and continue to review and update those plans, and we have employment agreements with certain key executive officers, these plans and agreements do not guarantee that the services of our executive officers will continue to be available to us or that we will be able to find suitable management personnel to replace departing executives on a timely basis.\nFurthermore, our strategy requires us to continue to train, motivate and manage our employees and to attract, motivate and retain additional qualified managerial and merchandising personnel. The ability to meet our labor needs while controlling costs is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates, health care and minimum wage legislation and changing demographics. If we are unable to attract and retain quality sales associates and management, the ability to meet growth goals or to sustain expected levels of profitability may be compromised.\nOur stock price may be volatile and could decline substantially. The stock market has, from time to time, experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. Many factors may cause the market price for our common stock to decline, including:\n\u00b7 operating results failing to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors in any quarter;\n\u00b7 downward revisions in securities analysts\u2019 estimates;\n\u00b7 material announcements by us or our competitors; and\n\u00b7 the other risk factors cited in this annual report.\nIn the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been the subject of securities class action litigation. If we become involved in a securities class action litigation in the future, it could result in substantial costs and diversion of management attention and resources, thus harming our business.\nFailure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have a material adverse effect on our stock price. We must continue to document, test and evaluate our internal control over financial reporting in order to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which requires annual reports by management regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and a report by our independent registered public accounting firm attesting to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We have expended, and expect that we will continue to expend, significant management time and resources documenting and testing our internal control over financial reporting. If we conclude in future periods that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective, it could result in lost investor confidence in the accuracy, reliability and completeness of our financial reports. Any such events could have a material adverse effect on our stock price.\nWe are controlled by our principal shareholder. J. Wayne Weaver, our Chairman of the Board of Directors and principal shareholder, and his spouse together own approximately 24.6% of our outstanding common stock. Accordingly, Mr. Weaver is able to exert substantial influence over our management and operations. In addition, his interests may differ from or be opposed to the interests of our other shareholders, and his control may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control that may be favored by other shareholders.\nProvisions of our organizational documents and Indiana law might deter acquisition bids for us. Our Restated Articles of Incorporation and Indiana corporate laws contain provisions that may discourage other persons from attempting to acquire control of us, including, without limitation, a Board of Directors that has staggered terms for its members, supermajority voting provisions, restrictions on the ability of shareholders to call a special meeting of shareholders and procedural requirements in connection with shareholder proposals or director nominations. The Board of Directors has the authority to issue preferred stock in one or more series without the approval of the holders of our common stock. Further, Indiana corporate law contains business combination provisions that, in general, prohibit for five years any business combination with a beneficial owner of 10% or more of our common stock unless the holder\u2019s acquisition of the stock was approved in advance by our Board of Directors. Indiana\ncorporate law also contains control share acquisition provisions that limit the ability of certain shareholders to vote their shares unless their control share acquisition is approved. In certain circumstances, the fact that corporate devices are in place that inhibit or discourage takeover attempts could reduce the market value of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 79007, "SIC": 5661, "TIC": "SCVL"}
