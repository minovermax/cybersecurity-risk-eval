{"cik": "1472091", "company": "Edge Therapeutics, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-02-21", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with the other information contained in this Annual Report, including our financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report, before making your decision to invest in shares of our common stock. We cannot assure you that any of the events discussed in the risk factors below will not occur. These risks could have a material and adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and our future prospects would likely be materially and adversely affected. If that were to happen, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nPage | 8\nIndex\nRisks Related to the Merger\nThe ratio setting forth the number of shares of Edge common stock that will be issued in respect of each outstanding share of PDS capital stock, or the Exchange Ratio, is not adjustable based on the market price of Edge common stock so the merger consideration at the closing may have a greater or lesser value than at the time the Merger Agreement was signed.\nThe Merger Agreement has set the Exchange Ratio for the PDS common stock, and the Exchange Ratio is only adjustable upward or downward based on increases or decreases in the number of shares of PDS\u2019s issued and outstanding capital stock and the number of shares of PDS common stock issuable upon the exercise of all issued and outstanding equity awards, increases or decreases the number of Edge\u2019s issued and outstanding common stock, if the cash balances at closing of either Edge or PDS fall outside a pre-determined range, and the proposed reverse stock split, prior to the closing of the merger. The Exchange Ratio will depend on the exact reverse stock split ratio that is ultimately mutually determined by Edge and PDS and certain changes in the capitalization of the two companies, as well as the cash balances of both companies relative to the agreed upon ranges. If there is a significant divergence in the cash balances of either company relative to the agreed upon ranges there could be a material change to Exchange Ratio, which would affect the stockholders of one party at the expense of the other party. The longer it takes to complete the merger, the greater the possibility there is for the Company\u2019s cash balances to fall outside of the range. Any changes in the market price of Edge common stock before the closing of the merger will not affect the number of shares PDS securityholders will be entitled to receive pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Therefore, if before the closing of the merger the market price of Edge common stock declines from the market price on the date of the Merger Agreement, then PDS stockholders could receive merger consideration with substantially lower value. Similarly, if before the closing of the merger the market price of Edge common stock increases from the market price on the date of the Merger Agreement, then PDS stockholders could receive merger consideration with substantially more value for their shares of PDS common stock than the parties had negotiated for in the establishment of the Exchange Ratio. Because the Exchange Ratio does not adjust as a result of changes in the value of Edge common stock, for each one percentage point that the market value of Edge common stock rises or declines, there is a corresponding one percentage point rise or decline, respectively, in the value of the total merger consideration issued to PDS stockholders.\nFailure to complete the merger may result in Edge paying a termination fee or expenses to PDS and could harm the common stock price of Edge and future business and operations of each company.\nIf the merger is not completed, Edge and PDS are subject to the following risks:\n\u25cf\nif the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances and certain events occur, Edge will be required to pay PDS a termination fee of $1.75 million;\n\u25cf\nthe price of Edge stock may decline and remain volatile; and\n\u25cf\ncosts related to the merger, such as legal, accounting and investment banking fees which Edge and PDS estimate will total approximately $5.3 million, of which $3.5 million must be paid even if the merger is not completed.\nIn addition, if the Merger Agreement is terminated and the Edge Board determines to seek another business combination, there can be no assurance that Edge or PDS will be able to find a partner willing to provide equivalent or more attractive consideration than the consideration to be provided by each party in the merger.\nIf the conditions to the merger are not met, the merger may not occur.\nEven if the proposals referred to herein are approved by the stockholders of Edge and PDS, specified other conditions must be satisfied or waived to complete the merger. These conditions are set forth in the Merger Agreement. Edge and PDS cannot assure you that all of the conditions will be satisfied or waived. If the conditions are not satisfied or waived, the merger may not occur or will be delayed, and Edge and PDS each may lose some or all of the intended benefits of the merger.\nThe merger may be completed even though material adverse changes may result from the announcement of the merger, industry-wide changes or other causes.\nIn general, either Edge or PDS can refuse to complete the merger if there is a material adverse change affecting the other party between November 23, 2018, the date of the Merger Agreement, and the closing. However, certain types of changes do not permit either party to refuse to complete the merger, even if such change could be said to have a material adverse effect on Edge or PDS, including:\nPage | 9\nIndex\n\u25cf\nany effect, change, event, circumstance or development in general economic or business conditions generally affecting the industries in which PDS or Edge operate;\n\u25cf\nany act of war, armed hostilities or terrorism;\n\u25cf\nany changes in financial, banking or securities markets;\n\u25cf\nthe taking of any action required to be taken by the Merger Agreement;\n\u25cf\nany changes in accounting requirements or principles or any change in applicable laws, rules or regulations or the interpretation thereof;\n\u25cf\nany effect resulting from the announcement or pendency of the merger or any related transactions;\n\u25cf\nwith respect to Edge, any change in the stock price or trading volume of Edge common stock; or\n\u25cf\nwith respect to Edge, any clinical trial programs or studies, including any adverse data, event or outcome arising out of or related to any such programs or studies.\nIf adverse changes occur and Edge and PDS still complete the merger, the combined company stock price may suffer. This in turn may reduce the value of the merger to the stockholders of Edge and PDS.\nThe combined company will need to raise additional capital by issuing securities or debt or through licensing arrangements, which may cause dilution to the combined company\u2019s stockholders or restrict the combined company\u2019s operations or proprietary rights.\nThe combined company may be required to raise additional funds sooner than currently planned. Additional financing may not be available to the combined company when it needs it or may not be available on favorable terms. To the extent that the combined company raises additional capital by issuing equity securities, such an issuance may cause significant dilution to the combined company\u2019s stockholders\u2019 ownership and the terms of any new equity securities may have preferences over the combined company\u2019s common stock. Any debt financing the combined company enters into may involve covenants that restrict its operations. These restrictive covenants may include limitations on additional borrowing and specific restrictions on the use of the combined company\u2019s assets, as well as prohibitions on its ability to create liens, pay dividends, redeem its stock or make investments. In addition, if the combined company raises additional funds through licensing or other strategic arrangements, it may be necessary to grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to the combined company or otherwise restrict its operations.\nCertain Edge and PDS executive officers and directors have interests in the merger that are different from yours and that may influence them to support or approve the merger without regard to your interests.\nCertain officers and directors of Edge and PDS will participate in arrangements that provide them with interests in the merger that are different from yours, including, among others, the continued service as officers and/or directors of the combined company, severance and retention benefits, the acceleration of stock options and continued indemnification.\nFurthermore, in connection with the closing of the merger, all unvested options to acquire shares of Edge common stock and Edge RSUs (including those held by Edge officers and the Edge Board members (including Edge RSUs for 10,000 shares of Edge common stock held by each of Robert Spiegel, M.D., FACP, and James J. Loughlin, who are expected to remain on the combined company\u2019s board of directors, and stock options for 220,607 and 64,286 shares of Edge common stock held by Dr. Spiegel and Mr. Loughlin, respectively)) will vest in full. The exercise price of all unvested stock option awards held by the Edge Board members and officers was above the trading price of Edge common stock as of December 31, 2018. Additionally, the parties expect that Dr. Sol Barer will enter into a consulting arrangement in connection with serving as an advisor to the board of directors of the combined company.\nIn addition, certain of Edge\u2019s executive officers are expected to become executive officers of the combined company upon the closing of the merger. Specifically, Andrew Saik is expected to serve as Chief Financial Officer of the combined company, and W. Bradford Middlekauff is expected to serve as Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary of the combined company. Additionally, James Loughlin and Robert Spiegel, each of whom is a current director of Edge, and Andrew Saik, the Chief Financial Officer of Edge, are expected to be designated to serve on the combined company\u2019s board of directors following the closing of the merger.\nAdditionally, certain of PDS\u2019s directors and executive officers are expected to become directors and executive officers of the combined company upon the closing of the merger. Specifically, Frank Bedu-Addo, Ph.D. is expected to serve as the Chief Executive Officer, Lauren Wood, MD is expected to serve as Chief Medical Officer and Gregory Conn, Ph.D. is expected to serve as the Chief Scientific Officer of the combined company. Additionally, each of Frank Bedu-Addo, Ph.D., DeLyle Bloomquist, Sir Richard Sykes and Gregory Freitag, each of whom is a current director of PDS, are expected to be designated to serve on the combined company\u2019s board of directors following the closing of the merger.\nPage | 10\nIndex\nIn addition, certain of PDS\u2019s executive officers and directors and affiliates of PDS\u2019s directors currently hold shares of PDS common stock and preferred stock. Affiliates of certain PDS directors and certain executive officers of PDS will convert their unsecured subordinated convertible promissory notes into shares of PDS common stock prior to the closing of the merger pursuant to the note purchase agreement.\nThe market price of the combined company\u2019s common stock following the merger may decline as a result of the merger.\nThe market price of the combined company\u2019s common stock may decline as a result of the merger for a number of reasons including if:\n\u25cf\ninvestors react negatively to the prospects of the combined company\u2019s business and prospects from the merger;\n\u25cf\nthe effect of the merger on the combined company\u2019s business and prospects is not consistent with the expectations of financial or industry analysts; or\n\u25cf\nthe combined company does not achieve the perceived benefits of the merger as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by financial or industry analysts.\nEdge and PDS stockholders may not realize a benefit from the merger commensurate with the ownership dilution they will experience in connection with the merger.\nIf the combined company is unable to realize the full strategic and financial benefits currently anticipated from the merger, Edge and PDS securityholders will have experienced substantial dilution of their ownership interests in their respective companies without receiving any commensurate benefit, or only receiving part of the commensurate benefit to the extent the combined company is able to realize only part of the strategic and financial benefits currently anticipated from the merger.\nDuring the pendency of the merger, Edge and PDS may not be able to enter into a business combination with another party at a favorable price because of restrictions in the Merger Agreement, which could adversely affect their respective businesses.\nCovenants in the Merger Agreement impede the ability of Edge and PDS to make acquisitions, subject, in the case of Edge, to certain exceptions relating to fiduciary duties, or complete other transactions that are not in the ordinary course of business pending the closing of the merger. As a result, if the merger is not completed, the parties may be at a disadvantage to their competitors during that period. In addition, while the Merger Agreement is in effect, each party is generally prohibited from soliciting, initiating, encouraging or entering into certain extraordinary transactions, such as a merger, sale of assets or other business combination outside the ordinary course of business, with any third-party, subject to, in the case of Edge, certain exceptions. Any such transactions could be favorable to such party\u2019s stockholders.\nCertain provisions of the Merger Agreement may discourage third parties from submitting alternative takeover proposals, including proposals that may be superior to the arrangements contemplated by the Merger Agreement.\nThe terms of the Merger Agreement prohibit each of Edge and PDS from soliciting alternative takeover proposals or cooperating with persons making unsolicited takeover proposals, except, with respect to Edge, in certain circumstances where the Edge Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that an unsolicited alternative takeover proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to result in a superior takeover proposal. In addition, if Edge or PDS terminate the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances, including terminating because of a decision of a board of directors to recommend an alternative proposal, Edge would be required to pay a termination fee of $1.75 million to the other party. These termination fees and reimbursement obligations described above may discourage third parties from submitting alternative takeover proposals to Edge and its stockholders, and may cause the Edge Board to be less inclined to recommend an alternative proposal.\nThe lack of a public market for PDS shares makes it difficult to determine the fair market value of the PDS shares, and PDS stockholders may receive consideration in the merger that is less than the fair market value of the PDS shares and/or Edge may pay more than the fair market value of the PDS shares.\nPDS is privately held and its capital stock is not traded in any public market. The lack of a public market makes it extremely difficult to determine PDS\u2019s fair market value. Because the percentage of Edge equity to be issued to PDS stockholders was determined based on negotiations between the parties, it is possible that the value of the Edge common stock to be received by PDS stockholders will be less than the fair market value of PDS, or Edge may pay more than the aggregate fair market value for PDS.\nPage | 11\nIndex\nRisks Related to the Merger and Edge\u2019s Evaluation of Strategic Alternatives\nIf the merger is not completed, Edge may be unsuccessful in completing an alternative transaction on terms that are as favorable as the terms of the proposed transaction with PDS, or at all, and Edge may be unable to reestablish an operating business. The Edge Board may decide to pursue a dissolution and liquidation of Edge. In such an event, the amount of cash available for distribution to Edge\u2019s stockholders will depend heavily on the timing of such liquidation as well as the amount of cash that will need to be reserved for commitments and contingent liabilities.\nOn March 28, 2018, Edge announced that an independent Data Monitoring Committee, or the DMC, for Edge\u2019s NEWTON 2 clinical trial for EG-1962 recommended that the NEWTON 2 study be stopped based on the DMC\u2019s conclusion that the study has a low probability of meeting its primary endpoint. Based on the DMC recommendation, Edge decided to discontinue the NEWTON 2 study and has taken steps to notify health authorities and clinical investigators participating in the study. Edge has ceased all further development of EG-1962 and Edge\u2019s other product candidates and has implemented operating cost reductions and organizational restructurings, including a reduction in Edge\u2019s workforce, to preserve Edge\u2019s cash resources. Edge\u2019s strategic focus shifted to the identification and evaluation of a range of potential strategic alternatives designed to maximize stockholder value.\nIn April 2018, Edge engaged Piper Jaffray as Edge\u2019s advisor to assist with the exploration of strategic alternatives. Edge devoted substantial time and resources to exploring such strategic alternatives.\nTo date, Edge\u2019s current assets consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, Edge\u2019s clinical assets, Edge\u2019s listing on the Nasdaq Global Market and the Merger Agreement with PDS. While Edge has entered into the Merger Agreement with PDS, the closing of the merger with PDS may be delayed or may not occur at all and there can be no assurance that the merger will deliver the anticipated benefits Edge expects or enhance shareholder value.\nIf Edge is unable to consummate the merger with PDS, the Edge Board may elect to pursue an alternative strategy, one of which may be a strategic transaction similar to the proposed merger with PDS. Attempting to complete an alternative transaction will be costly and time consuming, and Edge can make no assurances that such an alternative transaction would occur at all. Alternatively, the Edge Board may elect to continue operations to conduct another study of EG-1962 or decide to pursue a dissolution and liquidation of the company. In such an event, the amount of cash available for distribution to Edge\u2019s stockholders will depend heavily on the timing of such decision, as with the passage of time the amount of cash available for distribution will be reduced as Edge continues to fund its operations. In addition, if the Edge Board was to approve and recommend, and Edge\u2019s stockholders were to approve, a dissolution and liquidation of the company, Edge would be required under Delaware corporate law to pay its outstanding obligations, as well as to make reasonable provision for contingent and unknown obligations, prior to making any distributions in liquidation to Edge\u2019s stockholders. Edge\u2019s commitments and contingent liabilities may include severance obligations, regulatory and clinical obligations remaining under Edge\u2019s NEWTON 2 study, fees and expenses related to the merger and liabilities relating to investigations of or litigation against Edge and other various claims and legal actions. As a result of this requirement, a portion of Edge\u2019s assets may need to be reserved pending the resolution of such obligations. In addition, Edge may be subject to litigation or other claims related to a dissolution and liquidation. If a dissolution and liquidation were pursued, the Edge Board, in consultation with its advisors, would need to evaluate these matters and make a determination about a reasonable amount to reserve. Accordingly, holders of Edge common stock could lose all or a significant portion of their investment in the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the company.\nFailure to obtain stockholder approval for the proposed reverse stock split may result in the combined company being unable to obtain compliance with minimum bid price requirements for an initial listing on any Nasdaq market tier and may result in Edge common stock being delisted from the Nasdaq Global Select Market.\nEdge is required pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement to submit to its stockholders a proposal to approve an amendment to its certificate of incorporation to authorize the Edge Board to effect a reverse stock split of all outstanding shares of its common stock, or the Reverse Stock Split Proposal. If the Reverse Stock Split Proposal is not approved by Edge\u2019s stockholders, the combined company will likely not be able to obtain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement for an initial listing on any Nasdaq market tier and, as a consequence, to the extent the merger is consummated under such circumstances, Nasdaq will immediately provide the combined company with written notification that the combined company\u2019s common stock will be delisted.\nUpon receipt of such delisting letter, the combined company will likely appeal the determination to the Nasdaq hearings panel, or the Hearing Panel. If the combined company has not regained compliance with Nasdaq listing requirements prior to such hearing, and the Hearing Panel decides to continue with delisting of the combined company, the Hearing Panel\u2019s decision may be appealed to the Nasdaq Listing and Hearing Review Council but such appeal would not stay the delisting process.\nPage | 12\nIndex\nThe issuance of shares of Edge common stock to PDS stockholders in the merger will dilute substantially the voting power of Edge\u2019s current stockholders.\nIf the merger is completed, each outstanding share of PDS common stock will be converted into the right to receive a number of shares of Edge common stock equal to the Exchange Ratio determined pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Immediately following the merger, Edge securityholders are expected to own approximately 30% of the outstanding capital stock of the combined company on a fully diluted basis, and PDS securityholders are expected to own approximately 70% of the outstanding capital stock of the combined company on a fully diluted basis. Accordingly, the issuance of shares of Edge common stock to PDS stockholders in the merger will reduce significantly the relative voting power of each share of Edge common stock held by Edge\u2019s current securityholders. Consequently, Edge securityholders as a group will have significantly less influence over the management and policies of the combined company after the merger than prior to the merger.\nIf the combined company after the merger is unable to realize the strategic and financial benefits currently anticipated from the merger, the Edge stockholders and the PDS stockholders will have experienced substantial dilution of their ownership interests in their respective companies without receiving the expected commensurate benefit, or receiving only part of the commensurate benefit to the extent the combined company is able to realize only part of the expected strategic and financial benefits currently anticipated from the merger.\nThe pendency of the merger could have an adverse effect on the trading price of Edge common stock and Edge\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations or business prospects.\nWhile there have been no significant adverse effects to date, the pendency of the merger could disrupt Edge\u2019s businesses in the following ways, including:\n\u25cf\nthe attention of Edge\u2019s management may be directed toward the closing of the merger and related matters and may be diverted from the day-to-day business operations; and\n\u25cf\nthird parties may seek to terminate or renegotiate their relationships with Edge as a result of the merger, whether pursuant to the terms of their existing agreements with Edge or otherwise.\nShould they occur, any of these matters could adversely affect the trading price of Edge common stock or harm Edge\u2019s financial condition, results of operations or business prospects.\nStockholder litigation and regulatory inquiries and investigations are expensive and could harm Edge\u2019s business, financial condition and operating results and could divert management attention.\nIn the past, securities class action litigation and/or stockholder derivative litigation and inquiries or investigations by regulatory authorities have often followed certain significant business transactions, such as the sale of a company or announcement of any other strategic transaction, such as the merger, or the announcement of negative events, such as negative results from clinical trials. Edge is currently and may in the future be the target of this type of litigation as a result of changes in Edge\u2019s stock price, past transactions, results of clinical trials or other matters. Any stockholder litigation and/or regulatory investigations against Edge, whether or not resolved in Edge\u2019s favor, could result in substantial costs and divert Edge\u2019s management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could adversely affect Edge\u2019s business and cash resources and Edge\u2019s ability to consummate a potential strategic transaction or the ultimate value Edge\u2019s stockholders receive in any such transaction.\nEdge is substantially dependent on Edge\u2019s remaining employees to facilitate the consummation of a strategic transaction.\nOn May 1, 2018, Edge announced that it planned to reduce its workforce by 29 to a total of eight full-time employees. Edge\u2019s ability to successfully complete a strategic transaction depends in large part on Edge\u2019s ability to retain certain of its remaining personnel. Despite Edge\u2019s efforts to retain these employees, one or more may terminate their employment with Edge on short notice. The loss of the services of any of these employees could potentially harm Edge\u2019s ability to consummate the merger, to run Edge\u2019s day-to-day operations, as well as fulfill Edge\u2019s reporting obligations as a public company.\nThere is no assurance that the proposed merger will be completed in a timely manner or at all. If the merger is not consummated, Edge\u2019s business could suffer materially and its stock price could decline.\nThe closing of the proposed merger is subject to a number of closing conditions, including the approval by Edge\u2019s stockholders of the issuance of shares of Edge common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement and the proposed reverse stock split of Edge common stock and other customary closing conditions. If the conditions are not satisfied or waived, the merger will not occur or will be delayed.\nPage | 13\nIndex\nIf the proposed merger is not consummated, Edge may be subject to a number of material risks, and Edge\u2019s business and stock price could be adversely affected, as follows:\n\u25cf\nEdge has incurred and expects to continue to incur significant expenses related to the proposed merger even if the merger is not consummated;\n\u25cf\nEdge could be obligated to pay PDS a termination fee of up to $1.75 million under certain circumstances pursuant to the Merger Agreement;\n\u25cf\nthe market price of Edge common stock may decline to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the proposed merger will be completed; and\n\u25cf\nEdge may not be able to pursue an alternate merger transaction if the proposed merger with PDS is not completed.\nRisks Related to Development and Regulatory Approval\nEdge may not be able to successfully develop or obtain regulatory approval for EG-1962 or any other product candidate.\nEdge has ceased all research and development activities for EG-1962 and its other product candidates. Edge currently has no drug products for sale and may never be able to develop marketable drug products. If Edge were to resume research and development activities, EG-1962 will require substantial additional clinical development, testing, and regulatory approval before Edge will be permitted to commence its commercialization. No clinical studies have been undertaken with respect to Edge\u2019s only other product candidates, EG-1964 and EG-1965. If Edge were to resume research and development activities, the clinical studies of Edge\u2019s product candidates will be, and the manufacturing and marketing of Edge\u2019s product candidates will be, subject to extensive and rigorous review and regulation by numerous government authorities in the United States and in other countries where Edge intends to investigate and, if approved, market any product candidate. If Edge were to resume research and development activities, before obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of any product candidate, Edge would have to successfully meet a number of critical developmental milestones. For example, for EG-1962, these would include:\n\u25cf\nproviding adequate and well-controlled data that the product candidate is safe and effective and shows a significant benefit over the active comparator in patients for the intended indication;\n\u25cf\ndemonstrating that the product candidate formulation is reproducible and can meet the relevant release specifications for each market Edge intends to commercialize in; and\n\u25cf\ncompleting the development and scale-up to permit manufacture of Edge\u2019s product candidates in commercial quantities and at acceptable prices.\nThe time necessary to achieve these developmental milestones for any individual product candidate is long and uncertain.\nIf Edge were to resume research and development activities, Edge may not be able to finalize the design or formulation of any product candidate. In addition, if Edge were to resume research and development activities, Edge may select components, solvents, excipients or other ingredients to include in its product candidates that have not previously been used in approved pharmaceutical products, which may require Edge to perform additional studies and may delay clinical testing and regulatory approval of its product candidates. If Edge were to resume research and development activities, Edge may not be able to complete development of any product candidates that will be safe and effective and that will have a commercially reasonable treatment and storage period, and may not be able to commercialize and earn revenue from any products candidates. Moreover, even if a product candidate can be approved, it could be blocked by competitor patents or exclusivities.\nThe regulatory approval processes of the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities are inherently unpredictable, and, to the extent Edge resumes research and development activities, if Edge\u2019s product candidates are subject to multiple cycles of review or Edge is ultimately unable to obtain regulatory approval for its product candidates, Edge\u2019s business will be substantially harmed. In addition, the regulatory approval processes can delay clinical trials, which can jeopardize the ability to generate revenues from the sale of products.\nOf the large number of drugs in development in the United States, only a small percentage successfully complete the FDA regulatory approval process and are commercialized. Edge has ceased all research and development activities for EG-1962 and its other product candidates but to the extent that Edge resumes research and development activities, Edge will not be permitted to market any of product candidates in the United States or in other global markets unless and until Edge receives approval of an NDA from the FDA or the requisite approval from such other global regulatory authorities. Successfully completing clinical studies and obtaining approval of an NDA is complex, lengthy, and expensive. The FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority may delay, limit or deny approval of product candidates for many reasons, including, among others:\nPage | 14\nIndex\n\u25cf\ndisagreement with, or disapproval of, the design of, procedures for, or implementation of, clinical trials;\n\u25cf\nthe inability to comply with conditions imposed by a regulatory authority regarding the scope or design of a clinical trial;\n\u25cf\ndisagreement with the sufficiency of the final content and data included in a marketing application;\n\u25cf\nfeedback from the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority on results from earlier stage or concurrent preclinical and clinical studies, that might require modification to the protocol;\n\u25cf\na decision by the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority to suspend or terminate clinical trials at any time for safety issues or for any other reason;\n\u25cf\nchallenges in meeting regulatory requirements to commence clinical trials in countries outside the United States;\n\u25cf\nfailure to conduct the trial in accordance with regulatory requirements;\n\u25cf\nfailure to demonstrate that the product candidate provides an overall benefit to risk or significant enough improvement over the comparator in the proposed indication;\n\u25cf\nfailure of the product candidate to demonstrate efficacy at the level of statistical significance required for approval;\n\u25cf\na negative interpretation of the data from preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u25cf\ndeficiencies in the manufacturing processes or failure of third party manufacturing facilities to effectively and consistently manufacture product or to pass FDA pre-approval facility inspection;\n\u25cf\nfailure to demonstrate adequate and reproducible product stability to support product commercialization;\n\u25cf\nfailure to adequately demonstrate process performance qualification prior to product commercialization;\n\u25cf\ninability to validate analytical and microbiological methods consistent with industry and government agency expectations; or\n\u25cf\nchanges in governmental regulations or administrative actions.\nFurther, if Edge were to resume research and development activities and experiences delays in the completion of, or termination of, any clinical trial of product candidates, the commercial prospects of those product candidates will be harmed, and Edge\u2019s ability to generate product revenues will be delayed or may not happen at all, which circumstances may significantly harm Edge\u2019s business, financial condition and prospects.\nClinical drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome, and results of earlier studies and trials and non-head-to-head analysis (e.g., historical comparisons) may not be predictive of future trial results.\nClinical testing is expensive and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. Failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process. The results of preclinical studies and early clinical trials of product candidates may not be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical trials. Many companies in the biotechnology industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials due to lack of efficacy, failure by the study drug to demonstrate sufficiently improved efficacy over a comparator arm, or adverse safety profiles, notwithstanding promising results in earlier trials. If Edge were to resume research and development activities, Edge\u2019s future clinical trials may not be successful.\nTo the extent Edge were to resume research and development activities, even if a product candidate receives regulatory approval, it may still face future development and regulatory challenges and any approved products will be subject to extensive post-approval regulatory requirements.\nTo the extent Edge were to resume research and development activities and in the future obtains regulatory approval for a product candidate, Edge would be subject to extensive ongoing requirements by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities governing the manufacture, quality control, further development, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, safety surveillance, import, export, advertising, promotion, recordkeeping and reporting of safety and other post-market information. The safety profile of any product will continue to be closely monitored by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities after approval. If the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities become aware of new safety information after approval of any of Edge\u2019s product candidates, these regulatory authorities may require labeling changes or, depending on the nature of the safety information, establishment of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, impose significant restrictions on a product\u2019s indicated uses or marketing, impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post-approval studies or post-market surveillance, cause a recall or even move to withdraw the marketing approval for the product.\nPage | 15\nIndex\nIn addition, manufacturers of therapeutic products and their facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with applicable regulations, including a focused pre-approval inspection in connection with any regulatory submission for approval. If Edge or a regulatory agency discover previously unknown problems with a product, such as problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, a regulatory agency may take regulatory actions against the manufacturing facility or Edge, leading to a product recall or withdrawal, or suspension of manufacturing.\nIf Edge, Edge\u2019s product candidates or the manufacturing facilities for Edge\u2019s product candidates fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, Edge\u2019s ability to commercialize Edge\u2019s products and generate revenue may be significantly limited.\nAdvertising and promotion of any product candidate that obtains approval in the United States may be heavily scrutinized by the FDA, including the Office of Prescription Drug Promotion, the Department of Justice, or the DOJ, the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General, state attorneys general, members of Congress and the public. Violations, including promotion of products for unapproved (or off-label) uses, may be subject to enforcement letters, inquiries and investigations, and civil and criminal sanctions by the FDA. Additionally, advertising and promotion of any product candidate that obtains approval outside of the United States will be heavily scrutinized by comparable foreign regulatory authorities.\nIn the United States, engaging in impermissible promotion of products, including for off-label uses, can also subject companies to false claims litigation under federal and state statutes, which can lead to civil and criminal penalties and fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a company can promote or distribute a drug product. These false claims statutes include the False Claims Act, or FCA, which allows any individual to bring a lawsuit against a pharmaceutical company on behalf of the federal government alleging submission of false or fraudulent claims, or causing to present such false or fraudulent claims, for payment by a federal program such as Medicare or Medicaid. If the government prevails in the lawsuit, the individual will share in any fines or settlement funds. Since 2004, these FCA lawsuits against pharmaceutical companies have increased significantly in volume and breadth, leading to several substantial civil and criminal settlements based on certain sales practices promoting off-label drug uses. This growth in litigation has increased the risk that a pharmaceutical company will have to defend a false claim action, pay settlement fines or restitution, agree to comply with burdensome reporting and compliance obligations, and be excluded from the Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal and state healthcare programs. If Edge does not lawfully promote any approved products, Edge may become subject to such litigation and, if Edge is not successful in defending against such actions, those actions may have a material adverse effect on Edge\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to obtain regulatory approval in international jurisdictions would prevent Edge\u2019s product candidates from being marketed abroad.\nTo the extent Edge were to resume research and development activities, and in the future obtains regulatory approval for a product candidate, in order to market and sell Edge\u2019s products in the EU, Canada, Japan and other international jurisdictions, Edge would have to obtain separate and distinct marketing approvals and comply with the respective regulatory requirements of each of these jurisdictions. The regulatory approval process outside the United States generally includes all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval, but can involve additional testing or safety surveillance. Edge may need to partner with third parties in order to obtain regulatory approvals outside the United States. Approval by the FDA does not necessarily guarantee approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions. Nor does the approval by one regulatory authority outside the United States ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions or by the FDA. Edge may not be able to file for marketing approvals and may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize Edge\u2019s products in any market. If Edge is unable to obtain approval of any product candidates by regulatory authorities in the EU, Canada, and other international jurisdictions, the commercial prospects of those product candidates may be significantly diminished and Edge\u2019s business prospects could dramatically decline.\nPage | 16\nIndex\nRisks Related to Edge\u2019s Business and Industry\nTo the extent Edge were to resume research and development activities, Edge\u2019s future success will depend on Edge\u2019s ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.\nEdge does not have the resources or the required expertise to develop any of its potential product candidates. To the extent Edge were to seek to resume research and development activities, because of the specialized scientific nature of Edge\u2019s business, it would need to hire additional qualified scientific personnel. The competition for qualified personnel in the pharmaceutical field is intense and, as a result, Edge may be unable to attract qualified personnel necessary for the future development of Edge\u2019s business.\nThe pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and is subject to rapid and significant technological change, which could render Edge\u2019s technologies and products obsolete or uncompetitive.\nIf Edge were to resume research and development activities, there is no assurance that Edge\u2019s product candidates will be the most effective, the safest, the first to market, or the most economical to make or use. The introduction of competitive therapies as alternatives to any of Edge\u2019s product candidates could dramatically reduce the value of those development projects or chances of successfully commercializing those product candidates, which could have a material adverse effect on Edge\u2019s long-term financial success.\nEdge\u2019s business and operations would suffer in the event of system failures.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, the servers of Edge\u2019s cloud-based computing providers and other systems, and those of other third parties on which Edge relies, are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. If such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in Edge\u2019s operations, it could result in a material disruption of Edge\u2019s drug development programs if Edge were to resume research and development activities. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or ongoing or planned clinical trials could result in delays in Edge\u2019s regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase Edge\u2019s costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach was to result in a loss of or damage to Edge\u2019s data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, Edge could incur liability and the further development of Edge\u2019s product candidates could be delayed.\nAny future collaborators may compete with Edge or have interests which conflict with Edge\u2019s. This may restrict any future research and development efforts.\nIf Edge were to resume research and development activities, large pharmaceutical companies with whom Edge may seek to collaborate may have internal programs or enter into collaborations with Edge\u2019s competitors for products addressing the same medical conditions targeted by Edge\u2019s technologies. Thus, such collaborators may pursue alternative technologies or product candidates in order to develop treatments for the diseases or disorders targeted by Edge\u2019s collaborative arrangements. Such collaborators may pursue these alternatives either on their own or in collaboration with others, including Edge\u2019s competitors. Depending on how other product candidates advance, a corporate partner may slow down or abandon its work on Edge\u2019s product candidates or terminate its collaborative arrangement with Edge in order to focus on these other prospects.\nIf any conflicts arise, Edge\u2019s future collaborators may act in their own interests, which may be adverse to Edge. In addition, in Edge\u2019s future collaborations, Edge may be required to agree not to conduct any research that is competitive with the research conducted under Edge\u2019s future collaborations. Edge\u2019s future collaborations may have the effect of limiting the areas of research that Edge may pursue. Edge\u2019s collaborators may be able to develop products in related fields that are competitive with the products or potential products that are the subject of these collaborations.\nBusiness disruptions could seriously harm Edge\u2019s financial condition and increase Edge\u2019s costs and expenses.\nEdge\u2019s operations could be subject to natural disasters, power shortages, telecommunications failures, water shortages, fires, medical epidemics and other manmade disasters or business interruptions, for which Edge or they are predominantly self-insured. The occurrence of any of these business disruptions could seriously harm Edge\u2019s financial condition and increase Edge\u2019s costs and expenses.\nEdge\u2019s employees may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements, which could have a material adverse effect on Edge\u2019s business.\nEdge is exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by employees could include intentional failures to comply with FDA regulations or similar regulations of comparable foreign regulatory authorities, to provide accurate information to the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, to comply with federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations and similar laws and regulations established and enforced by comparable foreign regulatory authorities, to report financial information or data accurately or to disclose unauthorized activities to Edge. Edge has adopted, implemented, and is enforcing a code of conduct, or Code of Conduct, and other compliance-based policies and procedures, but it is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions Edge takes to detect and prevent this activity, such as employee training on enforcement of the Code of Conduct and other policies and procedures, may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting Edge from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against Edge, and Edge is not successful in defending itself or asserting Edge\u2019s rights, those actions could have a significant impact on Edge, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.\nPage | 17\nIndex\nRisks Related to Edge\u2019s Intellectual Property\nIf Edge is unable to protect Edge\u2019s intellectual property rights, Edge\u2019s competitive position could be harmed.\nIf Edge were to resume research and development activities, Edge will depend on its ability to protect its proprietary technology. Edge relies on trade secret, patent, copyright and trademark laws, and confidentiality, licensing and other agreements with employees and third parties, all of which offer only limited protection. If Edge were to resume research and development activities, Edge\u2019s success will depend in large part on its ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in the United States and other countries with respect to Edge\u2019s proprietary technology and products.\nThe patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally are highly uncertain, involve complex legal and factual questions and have in recent years been the subject of much litigation. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of Edge\u2019s patents are highly uncertain.\nThe steps Edge has taken to police and protect Edge\u2019s proprietary rights may not be adequate to preclude misappropriation of Edge\u2019s proprietary information or infringement of Edge\u2019s intellectual property rights, both inside and outside the United States. The rights already granted under any of Edge\u2019s currently issued/granted patents and those that may be granted under future issued/granted patents may not provide Edge with the proprietary protection or competitive advantages Edge may seek in the future. If Edge is unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for Edge\u2019s technology and products, or if the scope of the patent protection obtained is not sufficient, Edge\u2019s competitors could develop and commercialize technology and products similar or superior to Edge\u2019s, and Edge\u2019s ability to successfully commercialize Edge\u2019s technology and products may be adversely affected.\nAlthough Edge has a number of issued/granted patents, the issuance/grant of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, and issued/granted patents that Edge owns or has licensed from third parties may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. Such challenges may result in the loss of patent protection, the narrowing of claims in such patents, or the invalidity or unenforceability of such patents, which could limit Edge\u2019s ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection for Edge\u2019s technology and products.\nProtecting against the unauthorized use of Edge\u2019s patented technology, trademarks and other intellectual property rights is expensive, difficult and, may in some cases not be possible. In some cases, it may be difficult or impossible to detect third party infringement or misappropriation of Edge\u2019s intellectual property rights, even in relation to issued/granted patent claims, and proving any such infringement may be even more difficult.\nEdge could be required to incur significant expenses to obtain Edge\u2019s intellectual property rights, and Edge cannot ensure that Edge will obtain meaningful patent protection for its products.\nThe patent prosecution process is expensive and time-consuming, and Edge or any future licensors may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. In addition, if Edge were to resume research and development activities, it is also possible that Edge or Edge\u2019s licensors will fail to identify patentable aspects of further inventions made in the course of Edge\u2019s development and commercialization activities before they are publicly disclosed, making it too late to obtain patent protection on them. Further, given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of Edge\u2019s patents or narrow the scope of Edge\u2019s patent protection. The laws of foreign countries may not protect Edge\u2019s rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and these foreign laws may also be subject to change.\nObtaining and maintaining Edge\u2019s patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submissions, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and Edge\u2019s patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nPeriodic maintenance fees on any issued/granted patent are due to be paid to the USPTO and foreign patent agencies in several stages over the lifetime of the patent. The USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. While an inadvertent lapse can in many cases be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. Non-compliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application include, but are not limited to, failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time limits, non-payment of fees and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents. If Edge or Edge\u2019s licensors fail to maintain the patents and patent applications covering any of Edge\u2019s product candidates, Edge\u2019s competitors might be able to enter the market, which would have a material adverse effect on Edge\u2019s business.\nPage | 18\nIndex\nEdge may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce Edge\u2019s intellectual property, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe Edge\u2019s patents or misappropriate or otherwise violate Edge\u2019s intellectual property rights. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce or defend Edge\u2019s intellectual property rights, to protect Edge\u2019s trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of Edge\u2019s own intellectual property rights or the proprietary rights of others. This can be expensive and time consuming and results can be uncertain. Many of Edge\u2019s current and potential competitors have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to defend their intellectual property rights than Edge can. Accordingly, despite Edge\u2019s efforts, Edge may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating Edge\u2019s intellectual property, particularly in certain parts of the world. Litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of management resources, which could harm Edge\u2019s business and financial results. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent owned by, or licensed to, Edge is invalid or unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that Edge\u2019s patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation proceeding could put one or more of Edge\u2019s patents at risk of being invalidated, held unenforceable or interpreted narrowly. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of Edge\u2019s confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. If any of these occur, Edge\u2019s business could be materially and adversely affected.\nFrom time to time Edge may need to rely on licenses to proprietary technologies, which may be difficult, expensive or not possible to obtain or Edge may lose certain licenses which may be difficult or not possible to replace.\nIf Edge were to resume research and development activities, Edge may need to obtain licenses to patents and other proprietary rights held by third parties to develop, manufacture and market Edge\u2019s product candidates. If Edge is unable to timely obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms and maintain these licenses, Edge\u2019s ability to commercially market Edge\u2019s product candidates may be inhibited or prevented, which could have a material adverse effect on Edge\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThird parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that Edge is infringing their intellectual property rights, the outcome of which would be uncertain and could have a material adverse effect on the success of Edge\u2019s business.\nIf Edge were to resume research and development activities, Edge\u2019s commercial success will depend upon Edge\u2019s ability to develop, manufacture, market and sell Edge\u2019s product candidates, and to use Edge\u2019s proprietary technologies without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. Edge may become party to, or threatened with, future adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding intellectual property rights with respect to Edge\u2019s products and technology, including interference (for patents with an effective date before March 16, 2013) and various post grant proceedings before the USPTO, and opposition proceedings at other patent offices. Third parties may assert infringement claims against Edge based on existing patents or patents that may be granted in the future. In the event a third party were to assert an infringement claim against Edge and Edge were ultimately found to infringe the third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, Edge could be required to obtain a license from such third party to continue developing and commercializing Edge\u2019s products and technology. However, Edge may not be able to obtain an appropriate license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if Edge is able to obtain a license, it may be non-exclusive, thereby giving Edge\u2019s competitors access to the same technologies licensed to Edge. Edge could be forced, including by court order, to cease commercializing the infringing technology or product. In addition, in any such proceeding or litigation, Edge could be found liable for monetary damages. A finding of infringement could prevent Edge from commercializing Edge\u2019s product candidates or force Edge to cease some of Edge\u2019s business operations, which could materially harm Edge\u2019s business. Any claims by third parties that Edge has misappropriated their confidential information or trade secrets could have a similar negative impact on Edge\u2019s business.\nEdge\u2019s trade secrets are difficult to protect.\nConfidentiality agreements with employees and others may not adequately prevent disclosure of Edge\u2019s trade secrets and other proprietary information and may not adequately protect Edge\u2019s intellectual property.\nPage | 19\nIndex\nIf Edge were to resume research and development activities, Edge\u2019s success will depend upon the skills, knowledge and experience of Edge\u2019s scientific and technical personnel, Edge\u2019s consultants and advisors as well as Edge\u2019s partners, licensors and contractors. Because Edge operates in a highly competitive technical field of drug discovery, Edge relies in part on trade secrets to protect Edge\u2019s proprietary technology and processes. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. Edge enters into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with Edge\u2019s employees and certain of Edge\u2019s corporate partners, consultants, sponsored researchers and other advisors. These agreements generally require that the receiving party keep confidential and not disclose to third parties all confidential information developed by the receiving party or made known to the receiving party by Edge during the course of the receiving party\u2019s relationship with Edge. These confidentiality and assignment agreements may be breached and may not effectively assign intellectual property rights to Edge.\nEdge\u2019s trade secrets also could be independently discovered by competitors, in which case Edge would not be able to prevent use of such trade secrets by Edge\u2019s competitors. The enforcement of a claim alleging that a party illegally obtained and was using Edge\u2019s trade secrets could be difficult, expensive and time consuming and the outcome would be unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the United States may be less willing to protect trade secrets. The failure to obtain or maintain meaningful trade secret protection could adversely affect Edge\u2019s competitive position.\nEdge may be subject to claims that Edge\u2019s employees or consultants have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers or other third parties.\nMany of Edge\u2019s employees and consultants were previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including Edge\u2019s competitors or potential competitors. Some of these employees, including each member of Edge\u2019s senior management, and consultants executed proprietary rights, non-disclosure and non-competition agreements in connection with such previous employment. Although Edge tries to ensure that Edge\u2019s employees and consultants do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for Edge, Edge may be subject to claims that Edge or these employees and consultants have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such employee\u2019s or consultant\u2019s former employer. Edge is not aware of any threatened or pending claims related to these matters or concerning the agreements with Edge\u2019s senior management, but in the future, litigation may be necessary to defend against such claims. If Edge fails in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, Edge may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if Edge is successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nIntellectual property disputes could cause Edge to spend substantial resources.\nEven if resolved in Edge\u2019s favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause Edge to incur significant expenses. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the market price of Edge\u2019s common stock. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase Edge\u2019s operating losses and reduce the resources available for development activities or any future sales, marketing or distribution activities. Edge may not have sufficient financial or other resources to adequately conduct such litigation or proceedings. Some of Edge\u2019s competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than Edge can because of their greater financial resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on Edge\u2019s ability to compete in the marketplace.\nEdge may not be able to protect Edge\u2019s intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on all of Edge\u2019s product candidates throughout the world could be prohibitively expensive.\nCompetitors may use Edge\u2019s technologies in jurisdictions where Edge has not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where Edge has patent protection, but where enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with any of Edge\u2019s future products, to the extent Edge resumes research and development activities, in jurisdictions where Edge does not have any issued/granted patents and Edge\u2019s patent claims or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from so competing.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biopharmaceuticals, which could make it difficult for Edge to stop the infringement of Edge\u2019s patents or marketing of competing products in violation of Edge\u2019s proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce Edge\u2019s patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial cost and divert Edge\u2019s efforts and attention from other aspects of Edge\u2019s business and will have uncertain outcomes.\nPage | 20\nIndex\nRisks Related to Edge\u2019s Financial Position and Capital Needs\nEdge has incurred significant losses since Edge\u2019s inception and anticipates that Edge will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future.\nEdge is a clinical-stage biotechnology company. Investment in biotechnology product development is highly speculative because it entails substantial upfront capital expenditures and significant risk that a product candidate will fail to gain regulatory approval or become commercially viable. Edge has not generated any revenue from product sales to date, and Edge continues to incur expenses related to Edge\u2019s ongoing operations. As a result, Edge is not profitable and has incurred losses in each period since inception in 2009. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, Edge reported a net loss of $40.9 million and $50.9 million, respectively.\nEdge expects to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future. Edge may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may adversely affect Edge\u2019s business. Edge\u2019s prior losses and expected future losses have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on Edge\u2019s stockholders\u2019 (deficit) equity and working capital.\nEdge has not generated any revenues since inception and may never become profitable.\nEdge has not generated any revenues since Edge\u2019s inception. If Edge were to resume research and development activities, even if Edge is able to successfully achieve regulatory approval for any product candidates, Edge does not know when any of these products will generate revenue for Edge, if at all.\nIf Edge were to resume research and development activities, Edge will require additional capital to fund Edge\u2019s operations and if Edge fails to obtain necessary financing, Edge will not be able to complete the development and commercialization of Edge\u2019s product candidates.\nEdge\u2019s operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since inception. If Edge were to resume research and development activities, Edge will require additional capital for the further development and commercialization of Edge\u2019s product candidates.\nUnder such circumstances Edge cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If Edge is unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to Edge, Edge may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of one or more of Edge\u2019s products or product candidates or one or more of Edge\u2019s other research and development initiatives.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to Edge\u2019s stockholders, restrict Edge\u2019s operations or require Edge to relinquish rights to Edge\u2019s technologies or product candidates.\nIf Edge were to resume research and development activities, Edge may seek additional capital through a combination of private and public equity offerings, debt financings, strategic partnerships and alliances and licensing arrangements. To the extent that Edge raises additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, Edge\u2019s then-existing stockholders\u2019 ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of then-existing stockholders. Debt financings may be coupled with an equity component, such as warrants to purchase stock, which could also result in dilution of Edge\u2019s then-existing stockholders\u2019 ownership. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed payment obligations and could also result in certain restrictive covenants, such as limitations on Edge\u2019s ability to incur additional debt, limitations on Edge\u2019s ability to acquire or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact Edge\u2019s ability to conduct Edge\u2019s business and may result in liens being placed on Edge\u2019s assets and intellectual property. If Edge were to default on such indebtedness, Edge could lose such assets and intellectual property. If Edge raises additional funds through strategic partnerships and alliances and licensing arrangements with third parties, Edge may have to relinquish valuable rights to Edge\u2019s product candidates, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to Edge.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Edge\u2019s Common Stock\nThe trading market in Edge\u2019s common stock has been extremely limited and substantially less liquid than the average trading market for a stock quoted on the Nasdaq Global Select Market.\nPrior to Edge\u2019s initial public offering, or IPO, there was no market for shares of Edge\u2019s common stock. Since Edge\u2019s initial listing on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on October 1, 2015, the trading market in Edge\u2019s common stock has been limited and substantially less liquid than the average trading market for companies quoted on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. The quotation of Edge\u2019s common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market does not assure that a meaningful, consistent and liquid trading market currently exists. Edge cannot predict whether a more active market for Edge\u2019s common stock will develop in the future. An absence of an active trading market could adversely affect Edge\u2019s stockholders\u2019 ability to sell Edge\u2019s common stock at current market prices in short time periods, or possibly at all. Additionally, market visibility for Edge\u2019s common stock may be limited and such lack of visibility may have a depressive effect on the market price for Edge\u2019s common stock. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 41% of Edge\u2019s outstanding shares of common stock was held by Edge\u2019s officers, directors, beneficial owners of 5% or more of Edge\u2019s capital stock and their respective affiliates, which adversely affects the liquidity of the trading market for Edge\u2019s common stock, inasmuch as federal securities laws restrict sales of Edge\u2019s shares by these stockholders under certain circumstances. If Edge\u2019s affiliates continue to hold their shares of common stock, there will be limited trading volume in Edge\u2019s common stock, which may make it more difficult for investors to sell their shares or increase the volatility of Edge\u2019s stock price.\nPage | 21\nIndex\nIf Edge fails to continue to meet all applicable Nasdaq Global Select Market requirements and Nasdaq determines to delist Edge\u2019s common stock, the delisting could adversely affect the market liquidity of Edge\u2019s common stock and the market price of Edge\u2019s common stock could decrease.\nEdge\u2019s common stock is listed on The Nasdaq Global Select Market. In order to maintain Edge\u2019s listing, Edge must meet minimum financial and other requirements, including requirements for a minimum amount of capital, a minimum price per share and continued business operations so that Edge is not characterized as a \u201cpublic shell company.\u201d Edge has received written notice from Nasdaq stating that, at present, Edge is not in compliance with the audit committee requirements for continued listing on The Nasdaq Global Select Market, because Edge currently has an audit committee comprised of two members. If Edge does not regain compliance with audit committee requirements in a timely manner, Nasdaq will provide written notification to Edge that Edge\u2019s securities will be subject to delisting. In addition, Edge has received written notice from Nasdaq stating that, at present, Edge is not in compliance with the bid price requirements for Edge\u2019s common stock because the bid price for Edge\u2019s common stock had closed below $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive business days. If Edge does not regain compliance with the bid price requirements in a timely manner, Nasdaq will provide written notification to Edge that Edge\u2019s securities will be subject to delisting.\nNasdaq has notified Edge that, in connection with the Merger, Edge will be required to submit a new listing application and meet Nasdaq\u2019s initial listing requirements, as opposed to Nasdaq\u2019s more lenient continued listing requirements. Edge cannot provide any assurance that it will meet the initial listing requirements at the closing of the Merger. If the merger is consummated, the combined company following such transaction will need to meet Nasdaq\u2019s initial listing standards. If Edge is unable to comply with Nasdaq\u2019s listing standards, Nasdaq may determine to delist Edge\u2019s common stock from The Nasdaq Global Select Market or other of Nasdaq\u2019s trading markets. If Edge\u2019s common stock is delisted for any reason, it could reduce the value of Edge\u2019s common stock and its liquidity.\nMarket volatility may affect Edge\u2019s stock price and the value of Edge\u2019s stockholders\u2019 investment.\nThe trading price of Edge\u2019s common stock, similar to other biotechnology companies, is likely to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond Edge\u2019s control, including, among others:\n\u25cf\nregulatory actions with respect to Edge;\n\u25cf\nthe recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u25cf\nannouncements by Edge or Edge\u2019s competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, collaborations or capital commitments;\n\u25cf\nregulatory or legal developments in the United States and other countries;\n\u25cf\ndevelopments or disputes concerning patent applications, issued/granted patents or other proprietary rights;\n\u25cf\nthe level of Edge\u2019s expenses;\n\u25cf\nactual or anticipated changes in estimates as to financial results;\n\u25cf\nvariations in Edge\u2019s financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to Edge;\n\u25cf\nfluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to Edge;\n\u25cf\nshare price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of Edge\u2019s shares;\n\u25cf\nannouncement or expectation of additional financing efforts;\n\u25cf\nsales of Edge\u2019s common stock by Edge, Edge\u2019s insiders or Edge\u2019s other stockholders;\n\u25cf\nmarket conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors; and\n\u25cf\ngeneral economic, industry and market conditions.\nPage | 22\nIndex\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies.\nBroad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of Edge\u2019s common stock, regardless of Edge\u2019s actual operating performance. The realization of any of the above risks or any of a broad range of other risks, including those described in these \u201cRisk Factors,\u201d could have a dramatic and material adverse impact on the market price of Edge\u2019s common stock.\nFuture sales of a substantial number of shares of Edge\u2019s common stock in the public market or other issuances of Edge\u2019s common stock or rights to purchase common stock, including pursuant to equity incentive plans could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of Edge\u2019s stockholders and could cause Edge\u2019s stock price to fall.\nEdge\u2019s stock price could also decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of Edge\u2019s common stock, including shares issuable upon exercise of stock options and warrants, or the perception that these sales could occur. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for Edge to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that Edge deems appropriate.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the holders of up to 3,290,905 shares, or 10.4%, of Edge\u2019s common stock outstanding, will have rights, subject to some conditions, to require Edge to file registration statements covering the sale of their shares or to include their shares in registration statements Edge may file for itself or other stockholders. Once Edge registers the offer and sale of shares for the holders of registration rights, they can be freely sold in the public market.\nIn addition, in the future, Edge may issue additional shares of common stock or other equity or debt securities convertible into common stock in connection with a financing, acquisition, litigation settlement, employee arrangements, or otherwise. Any such issuance could result in substantial dilution to Edge\u2019s then-existing stockholders and could cause Edge\u2019s stock price to decline.\nFuture issuances of Edge\u2019s common stock or rights to purchase common stock, including pursuant to Edge\u2019s equity incentive plans, could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of Edge\u2019s stockholders and could cause Edge\u2019s stock price to fall.\nAny future issuances of common stock or common stock-related securities, together with the exercise of outstanding options and warrants to purchase 7,632,383 shares of common stock as of December 31, 2018 and any additional shares issued in connection with acquisitions, if any, may result in material dilution to Edge\u2019s then-existing stockholders, and new investors could gain rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of Edge\u2019s common stock.\nEdge\u2019s principal stockholders and management own a significant percentage of Edge\u2019s stock and will be able to exert significant control over matters subject to stockholder approval.\nAs of December 31, 2018, Edge\u2019s executive officers, directors, holders of 5% or more of Edge\u2019s capital stock and their respective affiliates beneficially owned approximately 41% of Edge\u2019s outstanding voting stock (assuming no exercise of outstanding stock options). These stockholders may be able to determine the outcome of all matters requiring stockholder approval. For example, these stockholders may be able to control elections of directors, amendments of Edge\u2019s organizational documents, or approval of any merger, sale of assets or other major corporate transaction. This may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for Edge\u2019s common stock that Edge\u2019s then-existing stockholders\u2019 may feel are in their best interest. The interests of this group of stockholders may not always coincide with your interests or the interests of other stockholders and they may act in a manner that advances their best interests and not necessarily those of other stockholders, including seeking a premium value for their common stock, and might affect the prevailing market price for Edge\u2019s common stock.\nSome provisions of Edge\u2019s charter documents and Delaware law may have anti-takeover effects that could discourage an acquisition of Edge by others, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to Edge\u2019s stockholders and may prevent attempts by Edge\u2019s stockholders to replace or remove Edge\u2019s current management.\nPage | 23\nIndex\nProvisions in Edge\u2019s amended and restated certificate of incorporation, or certificate of incorporation, and amended and restated bylaws, or bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire Edge or increase the cost of acquiring Edge, even if doing so would benefit Edge\u2019s stockholders, or remove Edge\u2019s current management. These provisions include:\n\u25cf\nauthorizing the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval;\n\u25cf\nprohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors, which would otherwise allow for less than a majority of stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u25cf\nprohibiting stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of Edge\u2019s stockholders;\n\u25cf\neliminating the ability of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders;\n\u25cf\nestablishing a staggered board of directors; and\n\u25cf\nestablishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by Edge\u2019s stockholders to replace or remove Edge\u2019s current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of Edge\u2019s board of directors, who are responsible for appointing the members of Edge\u2019s management. Because Edge is incorporated in Delaware, Edge is governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may discourage, delay or prevent someone from acquiring Edge or merging with Edge whether or not it is desired by or beneficial to Edge\u2019s stockholders. Under Delaware law, a corporation may not, in general, engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the board of directors has approved the transaction. Any provision of Edge\u2019s amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for Edge\u2019s stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of Edge\u2019s common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for Edge\u2019s common stock.\nBecause Edge does not anticipate paying any cash dividends on Edge\u2019s capital stock in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, will be Edge\u2019s stockholders\u2019 sole source of gain.\nEdge has never declared or paid cash dividends on Edge\u2019s capital stock. Edge currently intends to retain all of Edge\u2019s future earnings, if any, to finance Edge\u2019s business. In addition, any future debt agreements may preclude Edge from paying dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of Edge\u2019s common stock will be Edge\u2019s stockholders\u2019 sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\nEdge is an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and Edge intends to take advantage of reduced disclosure and governance requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, which could result in Edge\u2019s common stock being less attractive to investors.\nEdge is an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, and Edge intends to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in Edge\u2019s periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. Edge cannot predict if investors will find Edge\u2019s common stock less attractive because Edge will rely on these exemptions. Edge may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until Edge is no longer an emerging growth company, which could potentially be for up to five years after the date of Edge\u2019s IPO, which occurred on October 1, 2015. If investors find Edge\u2019s common stock less attractive as a result of Edge\u2019s reduced reporting requirements, there may be a less active trading market for Edge\u2019s common stock and Edge\u2019s stock price may be more volatile. Edge may also be unable to raise additional capital as and when Edge needs it.\nIf Edge fails to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting in the future, Edge may not be able to accurately report Edge\u2019s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, which may adversely affect investor confidence in Edge and, as a result, the value of Edge\u2019s common stock.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that Edge maintain effective internal controls for financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. Edge\u2019s annual report on Form 10-K includes a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of Edge\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. This assessment includes disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by Edge\u2019s management in Edge\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting that results in more than a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act also generally requires an attestation from Edge\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of Edge\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. However, for as long as Edge remains an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act, Edge intends to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement.\nPage | 24\nIndex\nEdge\u2019s compliance with Section 404 requires that Edge incur additional accounting expense and management efforts. Edge currently does not have an internal audit group. Edge may not be able to complete any required Section 404 evaluation, testing and remediation in a timely fashion. During the evaluation and testing process, if Edge identifies one or more material weaknesses in Edge\u2019s internal control over financial reporting, Edge will be unable to assert that Edge\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is effective. Edge cannot assure Edge\u2019s stockholders that there will not be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in Edge\u2019s internal control over financial reporting in the future. Any failure to maintain internal control over financial reporting could severely inhibit Edge\u2019s ability to accurately report Edge\u2019s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. If Edge is unable to conclude that Edge\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if Edge\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm determines Edge has a material weakness or significant deficiency in Edge\u2019s internal control over financial reporting, Edge could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of Edge\u2019s financial reports, the market price of Edge\u2019s common stock could decline, and Edge could be subject to sanctions or investigations by Nasdaq, the SEC or other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in Edge\u2019s internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain other effective control systems required of public companies, could also restrict Edge\u2019s future access to the capital markets.\nEdge\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud.\nEdge\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed by Edge in reports Edge files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, is accumulated and communicated to management, recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. Edge believes that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.\nThese inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the controls. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in Edge\u2019s control system, misstatements or insufficient disclosures due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nRisks Related to the Combined Company\nIf the merger with PDS closes, the combined company will be subject to additional risks, including each of those described below.\nThe combined company\u2019s stock price is expected to be volatile, and the market price of its common stock may drop following the merger.\nThe market price of the combined company\u2019s common stock following the merger could be subject to significant fluctuations following the merger. Market prices for securities of early-stage pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other life sciences companies have historically been particularly volatile. Some of the factors that may cause the market price of the combined company\u2019s common stock to fluctuate include:\n\u25cf\nthe ability of the combined company or its partners to develop product candidates and conduct clinical trials that demonstrate such product candidates are safe and effective;\n\u25cf\nthe ability of the combined company or its partners to obtain regulatory approvals for product candidates, and delays or failures to obtain such approvals;\n\u25cf\nfailure of any of the combined company\u2019s product candidates to demonstrate safety and efficacy, receive regulatory approval and achieve commercial success;\n\u25cf\nfailure by the combined company to maintain its existing third-party license, manufacturing and supply agreements;\n\u25cf\nfailure by the combined company or its licensors to prosecute, maintain, or enforce its intellectual property rights;\nPage | 25\nIndex\n\u25cf\nchanges in laws or regulations applicable to the combined company\u2019s product candidates;\n\u25cf\nany inability to obtain adequate supply of product candidates or the inability to do so at acceptable prices;\n\u25cf\nadverse regulatory authority decisions;\n\u25cf\nintroduction of new or competing products by its competitors;\n\u25cf\nfailure to meet or exceed financial and development projections the combined company may provide to the public;\n\u25cf\nthe perception of the pharmaceutical industry by the public, legislatures, regulators and the investment community;\n\u25cf\nannouncements of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments by the combined company or its competitors;\n\u25cf\ndisputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters, and the combined company\u2019s ability to obtain intellectual property protection for its technologies;\n\u25cf\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u25cf\nsignificant lawsuits, including intellectual property or stockholder litigation;\n\u25cf\nif securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about the combined company, or if they issue an adverse or misleading opinions regarding its business and stock;\n\u25cf\nchanges in the market valuations of similar companies;\n\u25cf\ngeneral market or macroeconomic conditions;\n\u25cf\nsales of its common stock by the combined company or its stockholders in the future;\n\u25cf\ntrading volume of the combined company\u2019s common stock;\n\u25cf\nadverse publicity relating to the combined company\u2019s markets generally, including with respect to other products and potential products in such markets;\n\u25cf\nchanges in the structure of health care payment systems; and\n\u25cf\nperiod-to-period fluctuations in the combined company\u2019s financial results.\nMoreover, the stock markets in general have experienced substantial volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of individual companies. These broad market fluctuations may also adversely affect the trading price of the combined company\u2019s common stock.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, stockholders have often instituted class action securities litigation against those companies. Such litigation, if instituted, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management attention and resources, which could significantly harm the combined company\u2019s profitability and reputation.\nEdge and PDS do not anticipate that the combined company will pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nThe current expectation is that the combined company will retain its future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of the combined company\u2019s business. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of the common stock of the combined company will be your sole source of gain, if any, for the foreseeable future.\nFuture sales of shares by existing stockholders could cause the combined company\u2019s stock price to decline.\nIf existing stockholders of Edge and PDS sell, or indicate an intention to sell, substantial amounts of the combined company\u2019s common stock in the public market after legal restrictions on resale lapse, the trading price of the common stock of the combined company could decline. Based on shares outstanding as of December 31, 2018 and shares expected to be issued upon the closing of the merger, the combined company is expected to have outstanding a total of approximately 101 million shares of common stock (prior to giving effect to the proposed reverse stock split) immediately following the closing of the merger. Approximately 36 million of such shares of common stock (prior to giving effect to the proposed reverse stock split) will be freely tradable, without restriction, in the public market. Approximately 65 million of such shares of common stock (prior to giving effect to the proposed reverse stock split) will be held by directors, executive officers of the combined company and other affiliates and will be subject to volume limitations under Rule 144 under the Securities Act and various vesting agreements.\nPage | 26\nIndex\nIf the ownership of the combined company common stock is highly concentrated, it may prevent you and other stockholders from influencing significant corporate decisions and may result in conflicts of interest that could cause the combined company stock price to decline.\nExecutive officers and directors of the combined company and their affiliates are expected to beneficially own or control approximately 59.6% of the outstanding shares of the combined company common stock following the closing of the merger. Accordingly, these executive officers, directors and their affiliates, acting as a group, will have substantial influence over the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of the combined company assets or any other significant corporate transactions. These stockholders may also delay or prevent a change of control of the combined company, even if such a change of control would benefit the other stockholders of the combined company. The significant concentration of stock ownership may adversely affect the trading price of the combined company\u2019s common stock due to investors\u2019 perception that conflicts of interest may exist or arise.\nBecause the merger will result in an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code for Edge, pre-merger U.S. net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes will be subject to limitations.\nAs of December 31, 2018, Edge had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, of $128.6 million and $27.2 million, respectively, due to prior period losses. If a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d within the meaning of Section 382 of the Code, the corporation\u2019s U.S. net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes arising from before the ownership change are subject to limitations on use after the ownership change. In general, an ownership change occurs if there is a cumulative change in the corporation\u2019s equity ownership by certain stockholders that exceeds fifty percentage points over a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under state and foreign tax laws. Edge believes that it may have already undergone one or more ownership changes prior to the merger. The merger will also result in an ownership change for Edge and, accordingly, Edge\u2019s U.S. net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes will be subject to limitations on their use after the merger.\nChanges in tax laws and regulations or in the combined company\u2019s operations may impact the combined company\u2019s effective tax rate and may adversely affect the combined company\u2019s business, financial condition and operating results.\nChanges in tax laws in any jurisdiction in which combined company operates, or adverse outcomes from any tax audits that the combined company may be subject to in any such jurisdictions, could result in an unfavorable change in Edge\u2019s effective tax rate, which could adversely affect Edge\u2019s business, financial condition, and operating results.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the Tax Act. The changes included in the Tax Act are broad and complex. The impact of these changes on how the combined company\u2019s earnings are taxed include, among other items, (i) reducing the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%; (ii) repealing the corporate alternative minimum tax and changing how existing credits can be utilized; (iii) temporarily providing for elective immediate expensing for certain depreciable property; (iv) creating a new limitation on the deductibility of interest expense; and (v) changing rules related to uses and limitations of net operating losses created in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. Edge and PDS continue to evaluate the Tax Act and its impact on the combined company\u2019s businesses. It is possible that the Tax Act will be subject to further changes either in a technical corrections bill or entirely new legislation. The overall impact of the Tax Act also depends on the future interpretations and regulations that may be issued by U.S. tax authorities. Edge expects there will be further guidance provided by these authorities potentially having a material adverse effect on the combined company\u2019s financial condition or results of operations. The impact of broad proposals or of regulatory issuances on the combined company\u2019s business can vary substantially depending upon the specific changes or further guidance made and how the changes or guidance are implemented by the authorities.\nAnti-takeover provisions under Delaware law could make an acquisition of the combined company more difficult and may prevent attempts by the combined company stockholders to replace or remove the combined company management.\nBecause the combined company will be incorporated in Delaware, it is governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL, which prohibits stockholders owning in excess of 15% of the outstanding combined company voting stock from merging or combining with the combined company. Although Edge and PDS believe these provisions collectively will provide for an opportunity to receive higher bids by requiring potential acquirors to negotiate with the combined company\u2019s board of directors, they would apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by the combined company\u2019s stockholders to replace or remove then current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of the board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of management.\nPage | 27\nIndex", "PERMNO": 15784, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "PDSB"}
