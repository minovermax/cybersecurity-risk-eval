{"cik": "1434620", "company": "Interval Leisure Group, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nAdverse Events and Trends-Adverse events and trends in the vacation ownership, vacation rental and travel industries could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe success of ILG and our businesses depends, in substantial part, upon the health of the worldwide vacation ownership, vacation rental and travel industries. Travel expenditures are sensitive to business and personal discretionary spending levels and tend to decline during general economic downturns. Economic conditions may cause decreased demand for purchases of vacation ownership interests, may increase default rates among current owners, and may increase refund requests from our members. Members and other consumers may be unable or unwilling to travel to certain destinations where vacation ownership resorts and vacation rental properties are located based on one or more of the following factors:\n\u2022 inclement weather,\n\u2022 natural disasters, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, fires, floods and tsunamis,\n\u2022 epidemics, pandemics or other health concerns,\n\u2022 terrorism, regional violence, enhanced travel security measures and/or geopolitical conflicts,\n\u2022 price increases for travel related services,\n\u2022 financial instability of the airline industry and associated air carrier bankruptcies,\n\u2022 decreased airlift to relevant markets,\n\u2022 job actions and strikes, and\n\u2022 increased costs of transportation based on increased fuel prices.\nThese could result in a decrease and/or delay in demand for travel to our managed hotels and resorts and for exchanges and Getaways to, and purchases of, vacation ownership interests in affected regions. This decrease and/or delay in demand, depending on its scope and duration, could adversely\naffect our business and financial performance. Similarly, these factors could result in a decrease in the number of resort accommodations or vacation rentals available for use in our exchange programs or as vacation rentals. The matters described above could result in a decrease in the number of Interval Network members and could have a material adverse effect on the vacation ownership and vacation rental industries, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAvailability of Financing and Developer Insolvency-Lack of available financing for vacation property developers and the resultant potential for insolvency and bankruptcy of developers could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nVacation property developers, including HVO, rely on the credit markets for receivables financing used to fund their sales and marketing efforts and for financing new development. If receivables financing, vacation ownership asset backed securitizations, or financing for development of resorts is unavailable or is only available on unacceptable terms, developers may scale back or even cease operations, including sales and marketing efforts and development of resorts, which are sources of new members for our exchange networks. In addition, developers may seek to extend or adjust payment terms with us.\nInability to obtain financing on acceptable terms, or at all, previously caused and may in the future cause insolvency of resort developers affiliated with our exchange networks, which in turn could reduce or stop the flow of new members from their resorts and also could adversely affect the operations and desirability of exchange with those resorts if the developer's insolvency impacts the management of the resorts. In some cases a developer in bankruptcy could terminate its existing relationship with us. Insolvency of one or more developers that in the aggregate have significant obligations owed to us could cause impairments to certain receivables and assets which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nInsolvency of a number of vacation ownership properties managed by us, particularly several of our largest managed properties, could materially adversely affect the Vacation Ownership segment's business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAvailability of Financing-Lack of available financing for consumers could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA lack of available credit for consumers could result in a decrease in potential purchasers of vacation interests, which would negatively impact our vacation ownership sales and membership in our exchange networks. This may also cause a decrease in potential purchasers of interests at vacation properties we manage, which could lead to loss of management agreements. A lack of available consumer credit could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nConsolidation of Developers-Consolidation of developers could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations\nThe industry has been in a period of consolidation, which is expected to continue. When developers that have affiliation agreements with the Interval Network are acquired, they may choose not to continue the agreement or renew at the end of the current term. If we are unable to obtain or retain business relationships with the resultant resort developers, our results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nCompetition-The industries in which our businesses operate are highly competitive and these businesses are subject to risks relating to competition that may adversely affect our performance.\nOur businesses will be adversely impacted if they cannot compete effectively in their respective industries, each of which is highly competitive. Some of our competitors have significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources than we have. In particular, in the case of the Interval Network, its primary competitor, RCI, is larger. Through the resources of its corporate affiliates, particularly, Wyndham Vacation Ownership, Inc., itself engaged in vacation ownership sales, RCI may have greater access to a significant segment of new vacation ownership purchasers and a broader platform for participating in industry consolidation. Our Exchange and Rental business also competes for rentals with other leisure lodging operators, including both independent and branded properties as well as with alternative lodging marketplaces such as Airbnb and HomeAway, which operate websites that market available furnished, privately-owned residential properties in locations throughout the world, including homes and condominiums, that can be rented on a nightly, weekly or monthly basis. Competitive pressures may cause us to reduce our fee structure or potentially modify our business models, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe believe that developers will continue to create, operate and expand internal exchange and vacation club systems, which decreases their reliance on external vacation ownership exchange programs, including those offered by us, and adversely impacts the supply of resort accommodations available through our exchange networks. The effects on our business are more pronounced as the proportion of vacation club corporate members in the Interval Network increases. The vacation ownership industry has and may continue to experience consolidation through the acquisition of vacation ownership developers by other developers, which may result in the diversion of exchange membership and other business.\nOur Vacation Ownership business competes with other vacation ownership developers for sales of vacation ownership interests based principally on location, quality of accommodations, price, financing terms, quality of service, terms of property use, opportunity for vacation ownership owners to exchange into time at other vacation ownership properties or other program benefits as well as brand name recognition and reputation. A number of our competitors are significantly larger with greater access to capital resources and broader sales, marketing and distribution capabilities than we have. We also compete with other timeshare management companies on the basis of quality and types of services offered, price and relationship. Our ability to attract and retain purchasers of vacation ownership interests and management services depends on our success in distinguishing the quality and value of our vacation ownership offerings from those offered by others. If we are unable to do so, our ability to compete effectively for sales of timeshare interests and management contracts could be adversely affected.\nThird Party Relationships-We depend on relationships with developers, members and other vacation property owners and any adverse changes in these relationships could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur Interval Network business is dependent upon vacation ownership developers for new members and upon members and participants to renew their existing memberships and otherwise engage in transactions. Developers and members also supply resort accommodations for use in exchanges and Getaways. Our vacation rental businesses are dependent upon vacation property and hotel owners for vacation properties to rent to vacationers. The Interval Network has established relationships with numerous developers pursuant to exclusive multi-year affiliation agreements and we believe that relationships with these entities are generally strong, but these historical relationships may not continue in the future. During each year, the affiliation agreements for several of the Interval Network's new member-producing developers are scheduled to renew. The non-renewal of an affiliation agreement will adversely affect our ability to secure new members for our programs from the non-renewing resort or\ndeveloper, and will result in the loss of existing Interval Network members (and their vacation interests) at the end of their current membership to the extent that we do not secure membership renewals directly from such members. In addition, we may be unable to negotiate new affiliation agreements with resort developers or secure renewals with existing members in our exchange programs, and our failure to do so would result in decreases in the number of new and/or existing members, the supply of resort accommodations available through our exchange networks and related revenue. The loss or renegotiation on less favorable terms of several of our largest affiliation agreements could materially impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to obtain sufficient renewals of affiliations with resorts and memberships with consumers or to enter into new affiliation agreements, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to maintain existing or negotiate new affiliation agreements on terms as favorable as currently in place may be adversely impacted by the continued creation and operation of internal reservation and exchange networks by developers and vacation clubs, as well as by consolidation in the vacation ownership industry. This could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSimilarly, the failure of our businesses to maintain existing or negotiate new rental services arrangements and related management agreements with hotel and vacation property owners, as a result of the sale of property to third parties, contract dispute or otherwise, or the failure of vacationers to book vacation rentals through these businesses would result in a decrease in related revenue, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to obtain and maintain management agreements with the homeowners' associations or other parties that control management of vacation ownership resorts. The loss of several of our largest vacation ownership management agreements could materially impact the business, financial condition and results of operations of our Vacation Ownership businesses.\nInventory-Insufficient availability of inventory may adversely affect our profits.\nOur exchange networks' transaction levels are influenced by the supply of inventory in the system and the demand for such available inventory. The availability of exchange inventory is dependent on it being deposited into the system, directly by a member in support of a current or future exchange request or by a developer on behalf of its owners to support their anticipated exchanges.\nA number of factors may impact the supply and demand of inventory. For example, economic conditions may negatively impact our members' desire to travel, often resulting in an increase in the number of deposits made as a means of preserving the inventory's value for exchange at a later date when the member is ready to travel, while reducing the demand for inventory which is then available for exchange. Also, destination-specific factors such as regional health and safety concerns, the occurrence or threat of natural disasters and weather may decrease our members' desire to travel or exchange to a given destination, resulting in an increased supply of, but a decreased demand for, inventory from this destination. Additionally, inventory may not be as available to the Interval system because owners are choosing to travel to their home resort/vacation club system or otherwise not depositing with the Interval Network. In these instances, the demand for exchange and Getaway inventory may be greater than the inventory available. Where the supply and demand of inventory do not keep pace, transactions may decrease or we may elect to purchase additional inventory to fulfill the demand, which could negatively affect our profits and margin.\nIf we fail to develop vacation ownership properties, expand existing properties or are unsuccessful in entering into new agreements with third-party developers, we may experience a decline in vacation ownership interest inventory available to be sold by us, which could result in a decrease in our revenues. In addition, a decline in vacation ownership interest inventory could result in both a decrease\nof financing revenues that are generated from purchasers of vacation ownership interests and fee revenues that are generated by providing club, management, sales and marketing services.\nVacation Rental Revenue-Our success is dependent, in part, on revenue from vacation rentals and, if consumer demand for vacation rentals falls materially below historic levels, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nGeneral economic conditions can negatively affect demand for our rentals of vacation accommodations to our members and other vacationers, leading us to decrease pricing and resulting in reduced revenue from vacation rentals. Failure of our rental businesses to secure a sufficient number of vacationers for accommodations we offer could also result in increased obligations under guaranteed dollar amount or specified percentage provisions of certain hotel and resort management agreements and, ultimately, could affect our ability to obtain and maintain rental management agreements with vacation property owners. We also actively seek to provide vacation rental services to resorts participating in our exchange networks and rent units for developers and associations that are part of the Hyatt Residence Club or managed by TPI and VRI. Any material or prolonged decrease in demand and/or pricing for vacation rentals would further impact our revenue and, if materially below historical levels, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMarketing of Vacation Ownership Interests-The future growth of our vacation ownership business depends on our ability to market vacation ownership interests successfully and efficiently.\nWe compete for customers with hotel and resort properties and with other vacation ownership resorts and other vacation options such as cruises. The identification of prospective purchasers, and the marketing of our products to them, are essential to our success. We incur significant expenses associated with marketing programs in advance of closing sales. If our marketing efforts are not successful and we are unable to convert prospects to a sufficient number of sales, we may be unable to recover the expense of our marketing programs and grow our business.\nResale Market for Vacation Ownership Interests-The resale market for vacation interests could adversely affect our timeshare business.\nThere is not currently an active, organized or liquid resale market for vacation ownership interests, and resale of vacation ownership interests generally are made at sales prices substantially below their original customer purchase prices. These factors may make the initial purchase of a vacation ownership interest less attractive to potential buyers who are concerned about their ability to resell their vacation ownership interest.\nDebt Covenants-Restrictive covenants in our debt instruments could limit our flexibility or otherwise restrict our business activities.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had total debt of approximately $488.0 million borrowed under our revolving credit facility. We also had an additional $103.7 million, net of any letters of credit usage, available for borrowing under the credit facility at that date. We may also incur significant additional indebtedness in the future, including expanding our revolving credit facility by up to $100.0 million. Our indebtedness and the restrictive covenants contained in our credit facility may, among other things:\n\u2022 limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general business purposes;\n\u2022 limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general business purposes;\n\u2022 require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments;\n\u2022 limit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry;\n\u2022 place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to less leveraged competitors;\n\u2022 increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions; and\n\u2022 expose us to the risk of increased interest rates because our borrowings under our credit facility, are at variable interest rates.\nKey Personnel-Loss of one or more of our key personnel could adversely affect our relationships with third parties, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations require managerial, operational, sales and marketing expertise as well as the maintenance of relationships with resort developers, homeowners' associations, vacation property owners and other third parties. In particular, we are dependent upon the management skills and continued services of several members of our senior management team. The failure of such key personnel to continue to be active in management of our businesses could have a material adverse effect on relationships with third parties, business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our failure to attract and retain key personnel will adversely impact our ability to grow the HVO business. We do not maintain key employee insurance for any of our officers and employees.\nAdverse Events and Trends in Key Vacation Destinations-Events and trends in key vacation destinations could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA substantial percentage of the vacation ownership resorts currently participating in Interval's exchange networks are located in Florida, Hawaii, Las Vegas, Mexico and Southern California, a large number of vacation properties for which we provide rental services are located in Hawaii, and a significant portion of our European management revenue derives from Costa del Sol, Spain and Tenerife, Canary Islands. Approximately $211.1 million, $146.6 million, and $133.3 million of 2014, 2013, and 2012 revenue, respectively, which excludes the pass-through revenue, was generated from travel to properties in these key vacation destinations as well as hotel, resort and homeowners' association management services performed in these locations. As a result, our ongoing ability to successfully process exchange vacations for members, as well as our ability to find vacationers for accommodations marketed or managed by us, is largely dependent on the continued desirability of these areas as key vacation destinations. Any significant shift in travel demand for one or more of these key destinations or any adverse impact on transportation to them, such as decreased airlift, natural disasters, regional violence, terrorism or increased travel costs, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, the same events that affect demand to one or more of these key destinations could significantly reduce the number of accommodations available for exchanges, Getaways or rental to vacationers, as well as the need for vacation rental and property management services generally. Accordingly, any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, the impact of which could be prolonged. Similarly, the effects of climate change may cause these locations to become less appealing to vacation owners as a result of temperature changes, more severe weather or changes to coastal areas which could adversely affect our business.\nA substantial percentage of the HVO business' vacation ownership interests available for sale are located in Florida and Hawaii. These same events could affect sales of vacation ownership interests and other revenues related to those properties.\nInternational Operations-We operate in a number of international markets, which exposes us to additional risks that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRevenue from international operations for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012 was $131.4 million $96.3 million, and $87.4 million, respectively. We continue to seek to invest in various international markets.\nIn order to achieve widespread acceptance in international markets, we must continue to successfully tailor our services to the unique customs and cultures of relevant countries and markets. Learning the customs and cultures of various countries and markets can be difficult and costly, and the failure to do so could slow international growth. Operating in international markets also exposes us to additional risks, including, among others, compliance with applicable U.S. and foreign laws including economic sanctions, embargoes and anti-corruption laws, changes in regulatory requirements including taxation, limits on our ability to sell products and services and enforce intellectual property rights and difficulties in managing operations due to distance, language and cultural differences, including issues associated with staffing and managing foreign operations.\nWe are also exposed to risks associated with the repatriation of cash from certain of our foreign operations to the United States where currency restrictions exist, such as Venezuela and Argentina, which limit our ability to immediately access cash through repatriations. As of December 31, 2014, we had $5.2 million of unrealized loss in other comprehensive income within stockholders' equity pertaining to our Venezuela entity, until such time we sell or liquidate our investment. Furthermore, other countries in which we maintain operations may impose limitations on the repatriation of cash from such countries now or in the future. Any limitation on us to transfer significant cash across borders from our international operations pertaining to intercompany debt or intercompany trade payables, if any, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nExchange Rate Changes-Material changes in foreign currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur operations in international markets are exposed to potentially volatile movements in currency exchange rates. The economic impact of currency exchange rate movements on us is often linked to variability in real growth, inflation, interest rates, governmental actions and other factors. These changes, if material, could cause us to adjust our financing, operating and hedging strategies. In particular, significant fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the Euro and the British Pound, among other foreign currencies, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations due to the effects of translation of local currency balances and results into U.S. dollars. We do not currently engage in hedging transactions designed to reduce our exposure to foreign currency risk.\nAcquisitions and Strategic Arrangements-We may experience financial and operational risks in connection with acquisitions and strategic arrangements.\nIn October 2014, we purchased the HVO business. During the fourth quarter of 2013, our newly-formed subsidiary VRI Europe Limited purchased the European shared ownership resort management business of CLC World Resorts and Hotels, or CLC, and we also purchased the Aqua business in Hawaii. These acquisitions are in addition to the February 2012 acquisition of VRI and the November 2010 acquisition of TPI. We intend to continue selectively pursuing other acquisitions. However, we may be unable to identify attractive acquisition candidates or complete transactions on favorable terms. In addition, in the case of acquired businesses, we will need to:\n\u2022 successfully integrate the operations, as well as the accounting, financial controls, management information, technology, human resources and other administrative systems, of acquired businesses with existing operations and systems;\n\u2022 maintain third party relationships previously established by acquired companies;\n\u2022 attract and retain senior management and other key personnel at acquired businesses; and\n\u2022 successfully manage new business lines, as well as acquisition-related workload.\nWe may not be successful in addressing these challenges or any others encountered in connection with historical and future acquisitions. In addition, the anticipated benefits of one or more acquisitions may not be realized and future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities and/or the assumption of contingent liabilities. The occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe also intend to selectively enter into joint ventures and other strategic arrangements to provide new products and services complementary to those currently offered by our businesses. However, we may be unable to successfully enter into these arrangements on favorable terms or launch related products and services or such products and services may not gain market acceptance or be profitable. The failure to develop and execute any such initiatives on a cost-effective basis could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nImpairment of Assets-Goodwill and other intangible and long-lived assets associated with businesses we acquire may become impaired which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe performance of the businesses that we have acquired or will acquire may not meet the financial projections anticipated at acquisition or may be impacted by one or more unfavorable events or circumstances. This could negatively affect the value of goodwill and other intangible assets, as well as long-lived assets, and may require us to test the applicable reporting unit and/or asset for impairment. If following the test, we determine that we should record an impairment charge, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nEstimates and Assumptions-We are required to make a number of significant judgments in applying our accounting policies, and our use of different estimates and assumptions in the application of these policies could result in material changes to our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, changes in accounting standards or their interpretation could significantly impact our results of operations.\nOur accounting policies are critical to the manner in which we present our results of operations and financial condition. Many of these policies, including those with respect to our recently acquired vacation ownership business, are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments. We are required to review these estimates regularly and revise them when necessary. Our actual results of operations vary from period to period based on revisions to these estimates. In addition, the regulatory bodies that establish accounting and reporting standards, including the SEC and the Financial Accounting Standards Board periodically revise or issue new financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Changes to these standards or their interpretation could significantly impact our results in future periods. For example, the Financial Accounting Standards Board recently released a final, converged, principles-based standard on revenue recognition that will modify revenue recognition in periods after December 15, 2016.\nThird Party Relationships-We depend on third parties to process certain fulfillment services.\nIn connection with providing benefits and services in our Exchange and Rental businesses, we rely on third party service providers for processing certain fulfillment services. If these third parties are unable to continue to provide the services to us, our ability to deliver expected benefits and services to\nour customers may be adversely affected. This may cause dissatisfaction and may damage our reputation.\nAdvances and Extensions of Credit-Our results may be adversely affected if third parties who receive loans, advances or other credit from us are unable to repay.\nIn connection with obtaining or extending business relationships with our clients, on occasion we provide loans, advances and other credit. To the extent that these clients are unable to repay these amounts and they are not fully secured by collateral, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nIn connection with our vacation ownership business, we provide loans to purchasers to finance their purchase of vacation ownership interests. If purchasers default on the loans that we provide to finance their purchases of vacation ownership interests, the revenues and profits that we derive from the vacation ownership business could be reduced. Providing secured financing to some purchasers of vacation ownership interests subjects us to the risk of purchaser default. As of December 31, 2014, we had approximately $36.5 million of net timeshare financing receivables outstanding. We could incur material losses if there is a significant increase in the delinquency rate applicable to our portfolio of consumer loans. An increased level of delinquencies could result from changes in economic or market conditions, increases in interest rates, adverse employment conditions and other factors beyond our control. Increased delinquencies could also result from our inability to evaluate accurately the credit worthiness of the customers to whom we extend financing. If default rates for our borrowers were to increase, we may be required to increase our provision for loan losses. In addition, increased delinquency rates may cause buyers of, or lenders whose loans are secured by, our consumer loans to reduce the amount of availability under our financing or loan sale facilities, or to increase the interest costs associated with such facilities. In such an event, our cost of financing would increase, and we may not be able to secure financing on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nIf a purchaser defaults under the financing that we provide, we could be forced to write off the loan and reclaim ownership of the timeshare interest through foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure. If the timeshare interest has declined in value, we may incur impairment losses that reduce our profits. In addition, we may be unable to resell the property in a timely manner or at the same price, or at all. Also, if a purchaser of a timeshare interest defaults on the related loan during the early part of the amortization period, we may not have recovered the marketing, selling and general and administrative costs associated with the sale of that timeshare interest. If we are unable to recover any of the principal amount of the loan from a defaulting purchaser, or if the allowances for losses from such defaults are inadequate, the revenues and profits that we derive from the vacation ownership business could be reduced.\nVolatility in Credit Markets-Volatility in the credit markets may adversely impact our ability to finance the loans that our vacation ownership business generates.\nOur vacation ownership business provides financing to purchasers of our vacation ownership interests, and we may seek to obtain third party lender receivables financing. Volatility in the credit markets may impact the timing and volume of the timeshare loans that we are able to finance which could adversely affect our sales.\nSufficiency of Maintenance Fee Collection and Budgeting-Our continued management of homeowners' associations depends on their ability to collect sufficient maintenances fees.\nOur management fees from homeowners' associations are derived from maintenance fees levied on the owners by the associations. These maintenance fees also fund the operation, maintenance and improvements for the property. Many of the properties that we manage do not receive subsidies or\nresale services for foreclosed inventory from the developer. Once an association begins to experience a high default rate, if it is unable to foreclose and resell units to paying owners, the situation worsens as the maintenance fees on remaining owners continually increase to cover expenses. If the homeowners' associations that we manage are unable to levy and collect sufficient maintenance fees to cover the costs to operate and maintain the resort properties, such properties may be forced to close or file bankruptcy and may terminate our management.\nMost of our VRI Europe properties in Spain operate on a fixed fee basis and VRI Europe has a responsibility to maintain the properties. To the extent the costs of maintenance and operation exceed historic and planned amounts, we may be required to fund the deficit.\nControl of Managed Resorts-Our management agreements with homeowners' associations may not be renewed if an entity that offers management services acquires sufficient interests in the resort.\nThe homeowners' associations that engage us to manage their resorts are operated through an elected board. Entities that offer management services have acquired, or may acquire, a number of vacation ownership interests that may be voted to influence the composition of the homeowners' association board. To the extent that an entity offering management services is able to influence the membership or decision-making of the homeowners' association board based on their ownership of interests at the resort, our management agreements may not be renewed and our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nNew Products and Services-We may not be able to achieve our strategic objectives through new products and initiatives.\nIn order to support our strategic objectives, we have introduced new products and services and expect to continue to do so in the future. Launching new products and services involves a number of risks including the ability to achieve the anticipated level of market acceptance and to manage the costs and timeliness of rolling-out the product or service. If we are unable to gain market acceptance, experience substantial delays or are required to expend significantly more than expected, our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nProperty Renovations-A significant decrease in the supply of available vacation accommodations due to ongoing property renovations could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe vacation properties for which we provide rental and/or management services are expected to undergo significant renovations periodically. These renovations may result in a decrease in the supply of vacation accommodations available to vacationers during the applicable renovation periods. Furthermore, ongoing renovations at a particular property may negatively impact the desirability of the property as a vacation destination. A significant decrease in the supply of available vacation accommodations during renovation periods, coupled with the inability to attract vacationers to properties undergoing renovations, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCompliance and Changing Laws, Rules and Regulations-The failure of our businesses to comply with extensive regulatory requirements, or to obtain and maintain required licenses and rights, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur businesses are subject to various laws, rules and regulations on a global basis, including those specific to the vacation ownership industry, as well as those applicable to businesses generally, such as consumer protection, securities and sales, use, value-added and other tax laws, rules and regulations. While we believe that the operations and practices of our businesses have been structured in a manner to ensure material compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations, the relevant regulatory\nauthorities may take a contrary position. The failure of our businesses to comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations, or to obtain required licenses or rights, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, unfavorable changes in the laws, rules and regulations applicable to our businesses, including those related to the imposition of taxes, could decrease demand for the services offered by our businesses, increase costs and/or subject us to additional liabilities, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe vacation ownership industry is subject to extensive regulations in various jurisdictions in the United States and elsewhere, which generally require vacation ownership resort developers to follow certain procedures in connection with the sale and marketing of vacation interests, including the filing of offering statements with relevant governmental authorities for approval and the delivery to prospective purchasers of certain information relating to the terms of the purchase and use, including rescission rights. In addition, we provide financing to some purchasers of vacation ownership interests and we also service the resulting loans. This practice subjects us to various regulations, including those which require disclosure to borrowers regarding the terms of their loans as well as settlement, servicing and collection of loans. As a result, any negative change in the regulatory environment within the vacation ownership industry could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nVacation property operations are directly subject to a number of licensing requirements, as well as certain laws and regulations relating to consumer protection, particularly, those associated with hotel and resort management, including those relating to the preparation and sale of food and beverages, liquor service and health, safety and accessibility of managed premises. The failure of our businesses to comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations, or to obtain required licenses or rights, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLicensing-The exclusive license for the Hyatt\u00ae brand in connection with our vacation ownership business could be terminated.\nIf we default as specified in the Master License Agreement, dated October 1, 2014, with Hyatt Franchising, L.L.C., we could lose our exclusive right to use the Hyatt\u00ae brand in the timeshare business. The loss of this right along with the right to use Hyatt's marketing channels, including its existing hotel loyalty program, could result in the reduction of revenue and profits derived from our vacation ownership business.\nThe termination of the Master License Agreement would materially harm our business and results of operations and impair our ability to market and sell our products and maintain our competitive position, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. For example, we would not be able to rely on the strength of the Hyatt\u00ae brand to attract qualified prospects in the marketplace, which could cause our revenue and profits to decline and our marketing and sales expenses to increase.\nIn addition, the Hyatt Gold Passport Participation Agreement would also terminate upon termination of the Master License Agreement, and we would not be able to offer Hyatt Gold Passport Points to owners and potential owners, which could impair our ability to sell our products and reduce the flexibility and options available in connection with our products.\nHyatt\u00ae Brand-The Hyatt Vacation Ownership business depends on the quality and reputation of the Hyatt\u00ae brand, and any deterioration in the quality or reputation of the Hyatt\u00ae brand could adversely affect our market share, reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe offer vacation ownership products under the Hyatt\u00ae brand name, and we intend to continue to develop and offer products and services under the Hyatt\u00ae brand in the future. If the quality of the\nHyatt\u00ae brand deteriorates, or the reputation of the Hyatt\u00ae brand declines, our market share, reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nOur ability to expand our vacation ownership business and remain competitive could be harmed if Hyatt Franchising does not consent to our use of their trademarks at new resorts we acquire, develop or propose to franchise in the future.\nUnder the terms of our master license agreement, we must obtain Hyatt Franchising's approval, to use the Hyatt\u00ae brand in connection with shared ownership projects we acquire, develop or propose to franchise in the future. Hyatt may reject a proposed project if, among other things, the project does not meet applicable brand standards or is reasonably likely to breach applicable contractual or legal restrictions. If Hyatt does not permit us to use the brand in connection with our development or acquisition plans, our ability to expand our HVO business and remain competitive may be materially adversely affected. The requirement to obtain consent to our expansion plans, or the need to identify and secure alternative expansion opportunities if we do not obtain approval, may delay implementation of our expansion plans and cause us to incur additional expense.\nMaintenance of Brand Standards-The maintenance and refurbishment of Hyatt Residence Club properties in accordance with brand standards depends on maintenance fees paid by the owners of vacation ownership interests.\nOwners of vacation ownership interests at Hyatt Residence Club resorts must pay maintenance fees levied by property owners' association boards. These maintenance fees are used to maintain and refurbish the vacation ownership properties and to keep the properties in compliance with Hyatt\u00ae brand standards. If property owners' association boards do not levy sufficient maintenance fees or special assessments, or if owners of vacation ownership interests do not pay these fees, not only would our management fee revenue be adversely affected, but the vacation ownership properties could fail to comply with applicable brand standards. If any vacation ownership property fails to comply with the brand standards, Hyatt could terminate our rights under the Master License Agreement to use its trademarks at such noncompliant property, which could result in the loss of management fees, decrease customer satisfaction and impair our ability to market and sell our products at the non-compliant locations.\nTiming, budgeting and other risks could result in delays or cancellations of our efforts to develop the vacation ownership developments that we undertake, or make these activities more expensive, which could reduce our profits or impair our ability to compete effectively.\nWe plan to selectively undertake, in some cases with joint venture partners, construction of vacation ownership developments which may span multiple phases and often take years to complete. These efforts are subject to a number of risks, including:\n\u2022 construction delays or cost overruns (including labor and materials) that may increase project costs;\n\u2022 obtaining zoning, occupancy and other required permits or authorizations;\n\u2022 changes in economic conditions that may result in weakened or lack of demand or negative project returns;\n\u2022 governmental restrictions on the size or kind of development;\n\u2022 force majeure events, including earthquakes, tornados, hurricanes, floods or tsunamis; and\n\u2022 design defects that could increase costs\nAdditionally, developing new properties often involves lengthy development periods during which significant amounts of capital must be funded before sales proceeds are available to defray costs. If the cost of funding new development exceeds budgeted amounts, and/or the time period for development is longer than initially anticipated, our profits could be reduced. Further, due to the lengthy development cycle, adverse economic conditions may alter or impede our development plans, thereby resulting in incremental costs to us or potential impairment charges.\nPartnerships and Joint Ventures-Investing through partnerships or joint ventures decreases our ability to manage risk.\nIn addition to acquiring or developing resorts or acquiring companies that complement our business directly, we have from time to time invested, and expect to continue to invest, as a co-venturer. Joint venturers often have shared control over the operation of the joint venture assets. Therefore, joint venture investments may involve risks such as the possibility that the co-venturer in an investment might become bankrupt or not have the financial resources to meet its obligations, or have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals, or be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions or requests or contrary to our policies or objectives. Consequently, actions by a co-venturer might subject resorts or other businesses owned by the joint venture to additional risk. Further, we may be unable to take action without the approval of our joint venture partners. Alternatively, our joint venture partners could take actions binding on the joint venture without our consent. Additionally, should a joint venture partner become bankrupt, we could become liable for our partner's share of joint venture liabilities.\nMaintenance of Systems and Infrastructure-Our success depends, in part, on the integrity of our systems and infrastructure. System interruption and the lack of integration and redundancy in these systems and infrastructure may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to maintain the integrity of our systems and infrastructure, including websites, information and related systems, call centers and distribution and fulfillment facilities. System interruption and any lack of integration and redundancy in our information systems and infrastructure may adversely affect our ability to operate websites, process and fulfill transactions, respond to customer inquiries and generally maintain cost-efficient operations. We may experience occasional system interruptions that make some or all systems or data unavailable or prevent our businesses from efficiently providing services or fulfilling orders. We also rely on third-party computer systems, broadband and other communications systems and service providers in connection with the provision of services generally, as well as to facilitate, process and fulfill transactions. Any interruptions, outages or delays in the systems and infrastructures of our businesses and/or third parties, or deterioration in the performance of these systems and infrastructure, could impair the ability of our businesses to provide services, fulfill orders and/or process transactions.\nFire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, acts of war or terrorism, acts of God and similar events or disruptions may damage or interrupt computer, broadband or other communications systems and infrastructure at any time. Any of these events could cause system interruption, delays and loss of critical data, and could prevent our businesses from providing services, fulfilling orders and/or processing transactions. While our businesses have backup systems for certain aspects of their operations, these systems are not fully redundant and disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for all eventualities. In addition, we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a major interruption. If any of these adverse events were to occur, it could adversely affect our business, financial conditions and results of operations.\nTechnology Projects-Business interruptions, cost overruns or project delays in connection with our undertaking of significant technology projects may materially adversely affect our business.\nWe have several significant development projects related to our proprietary and third party technology. We have committed sizable resources to these projects, which are expected to be phased in over several years. These projects are extremely complex, in part, because of the wide range of processes and the legacy systems involved. We use both internal and external resources, and if these resources become unavailable, our business and operations may be adversely affected. As we proceed with our existing projects, we are using controlled project plans and change control processes that we believe will provide for the adequate allocation of resources. However, a divergence from these may result in cost overruns or project delays. If the systems do not operate as expected, this could impact our ability to perform necessary business operations, which could materially adversely affect our business.\nPrivacy-The processing, storage, use and disclosure of personal data could give rise to liabilities as a result of governmental regulation, conflicting legal requirements, or requirements imposed by credit card companies.\nIn the processing of consumer transactions, our businesses receive, transmit and store a large volume of personally identifiable information and other user data. The sharing, use, disclosure and protection of this information are governed by the privacy and data security policies maintained by us and our businesses. Moreover, there are federal, state and international laws regarding privacy and the storing, sharing, use, disclosure and protection of personally identifiable information and user data. Specifically, personally identifiable information is increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world, the intent of which is to protect the privacy of personal information that is collected, processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction. We could be adversely affected if legislation or regulations are expanded to require changes in business practices or privacy policies, or if governing jurisdictions interpret or implement their legislation or regulations in ways that negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA company processing, storing, or transmitting payment card data must be compliant with Payment Card Industry-Data Security Standards, or PCI-DSS, or risk losing its ability to process credit card payments and being audited and/or fined. As of December 31, 2014, we believe our Interval, HVO and VRI Europe businesses are compliant with these standards and our Aqua, Aston, VRI and TPI businesses are working to become fully compliant. Failure to obtain or maintain PCI-DSS compliance could result in our inability to accept credit card payments or subject us to penalties and thus could have a material negative effect on our operations. Changes in these security standards may cause us to incur significant unanticipated expenses to meet new requirements.\nOnline Security Risks-We are subject to online security risks, including security breaches and identity theft and the related requirements imposed by credit card companies.\nOur failure, and/or the failure by the various third party vendors and service providers with which we do business, to comply with applicable privacy policies or federal, state or similar international laws and regulations or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release of personally identifiable information or other user data could damage the reputation of our businesses, discourage potential users from trying our products and services and/or result in fines and/or proceedings by governmental agencies and/or consumers, one or all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any penetration of network security or other misappropriation or misuse of personal consumer information could cause interruptions in the operations of our businesses and subject us to increased costs, litigation and other liabilities. Security breaches could also significantly damage our reputation with consumers and third parties with whom we do business. It is possible that advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries, undetected fraud, inadvertent violations of company policies or procedures or other developments could result in a\ncompromise of information or a breach of the technology and security processes that are used to protect consumer transaction data. As a result, current security measures may not prevent any or all security breaches. We may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against and remedy any potential or existing security breaches and their consequences.\nIntellectual Property-We may fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing intellectual property rights of third parties.\nWe may fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing intellectual property rights of third parties. Our failure to protect our intellectual property rights in a meaningful manner or challenges to related contractual rights could result in erosion of brand names and limit our ability to control marketing, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFrom time to time, we are subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business, including claims of alleged infringement of the trademarks, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties. In addition, litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others. Any litigation of this nature, regardless of outcome or merit, will likely be protracted and expensive and could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nInsurance-Damage to, or other potential losses involving, properties that we own or manage may not be covered by insurance.\nMarket forces beyond our control may limit the scope of the insurance coverage we can obtain or our ability to obtain coverage at reasonable rates. Certain types of losses, generally of a catastrophic nature, such as earthquakes, hurricanes and floods, or terrorist acts, may be uninsurable or the price of coverage for such losses may be too expensive to justify obtaining insurance. As a result, the cost of our insurance may increase and our coverage levels may decrease. In addition, in the event of a substantial loss, the insurance coverage we carry may not be sufficient to pay the full market value or replacement cost of our lost investment or that of owners of vacation ownership interests or in some cases may not provide a recovery for any part of a loss. As a result, we could lose some or all of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property, we could lose the management contract for the property and for HVO properties, the property may lose the brand.\nTakeover Defenses-Our rights plan, charter provisions and terms of our debt agreements may affect the likelihood of a takeover or change of control of ILG.\nWe have in place a stockholders' rights plan and certain charter provisions that may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or delaying or preventing changes in control or management of our company that are not approved by our board. In particular, our charter provides that stockholders may not act by written consent and that the board has the power to issue shares of preferred stock with such designation, powers, preferences, and rights as the board shall determine. The transactions that may be deterred, delayed or prevented might have allowed our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares over then-current market prices. In addition, under our senior credit facility, a change of control (as defined in the credit agreement) constitutes an event of default, entitling our lenders to terminate the facility and require us to repay outstanding borrowings. As a result, the provisions of this agreement also may affect the likelihood of a takeover or other change of control. Under the master license agreement, we need Hyatt's written consent prior to a change of control (as defined in the agreement) of our subsidiary, S.O.I. Acquisition Corp. and, in certain cases, of ILG.\nDividends-We may not continue paying dividends at the same rate or at all.\nWhile we began paying quarterly dividends in 2012, we may be unable to continue to pay dividends at the current rate or at all based on covenants in our credit agreement or if we do not have sufficient surplus under Delaware law. Our board of directors may determine not to declare dividends if the board deems this action to be in our company's best interests. Discontinuing payment of dividends could change the manner, timing and/or ability to realize gains on investment in our common stock.", "PERMNO": 92772, "SIC": 6532, "TIC": "ILG"}
