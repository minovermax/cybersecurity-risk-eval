{"cik": "1632127", "company": "Cable One, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-26", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider all of the information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and each of the risks described below, which we believe are the principal risks that we face. Some risks relate principally to the securities markets and ownership of our common stock.\nAny of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial results, financial condition and results of operations and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has impacted our operations and adversely affected our business, financial results and financial condition, and the duration and extent to which it will continue to do so is uncertain and difficult to predict.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the United States and other countries, which has resulted in international, Federal, state and local governments implementing numerous measures to try to reduce the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19, including travel restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place or total lock-down orders and business limitations and shutdowns.\nWe are a part of the United States\u2019 critical infrastructure, and our continued operation is essential to connectivity services that are vital during the COVID-19 pandemic. At the same time, the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic has caused us to modify our operations, including restricting our technicians from entering customer homes and businesses; closing or limiting access to local offices and our corporate headquarters for associates, customers and others; limiting non-essential travel for associates; instituting an expanded work-from-home program, including enhancing our technological capabilities to support such efforts; implementing several compensation-related enhancements, including \u201cpurpose pay,\u201d which provided a 25% premium to base pay for certain associates who were required to leave their homes to perform their essential job functions and was concluded in early September 2020; establishing health protocols and providing personal protective equipment to protect our associates, customers and others; temporarily discontinuing charging data overage fees, waiving late charges and suspending disconnection of data and voice services for residential and business customers who were unable to pay due to disruptions caused by the pandemic, each of which has concluded; and introducing a new lower-cost residential data plan. We have taken and may take further actions required by governmental authorities or that we determine are prudent to support the well-being of our associates, customers, suppliers, business partners and others.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 outbreak and the related responses by us and from governmental authorities, our operations have been impacted as described above, which has resulted, and may continue to result, in various negative impacts associated with the pandemic, such as reduced revenues from data overage fees, late charges, reconnect fees, and advertising and business services as well as increased expenses, which combined to suppress Adjusted EBITDA in 2020. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Impact of COVID-19\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. Additionally, our business, financial results and financial condition have been and could be further adversely affected in a number of ways, which may include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u25cf\nfurther disruptions to our regular, ongoing operations and restrictions on our sales and marketing efforts, especially related to business services;\n\u25cf\ninterruptions to our engineering, design and implementation of plant and infrastructure as well as other important business activities;\n\u25cf\nlimitations on associate resources and availability, including in our call centers and among our technicians, due to health protocols, sickness, government restrictions, the desire of associates to avoid contact with large groups of people, school closures or other factors, which may further constrain capacity to respond to the increased demand for our products and services;\n\u25cf\nthe potential further diversion of senior management\u2019s attention in the event that key and/or large numbers of associates contract COVID-19 and, consequently, have limited ability or become unable to work;\n\u25cf\ninterruptions or delays receiving and limited availability of necessary hardware, software and operational supplies, equipment and support;\n\u25cf\npossible further reductions of revenues, Adjusted EBITDA and/or Adjusted EBITDA margin and increased expenses as well as greater difficulty in collecting customer receivables resulting from, among other things, our actions to assist customers and support our associates during the COVID-19 crisis;\n\u25cf\na fluctuation in interest rates that could result from market uncertainties;\n\u25cf\nan increase in the cost of or the difficulty to obtain debt or equity financing, which could affect our financial condition or our ability to fund operations or future acquisition or investment opportunities;\n\u25cf\na further delay in the implementation of our new ERP system;\n\u25cf\npotential legislative or regulatory efforts to impose new requirements on our data services;\n\u25cf\nchanges to the carrying value of our goodwill and intangible assets; and\n\u25cf\nan increase in regulatory restrictions or continued market volatility that could hinder our ability to execute our business strategies, including acquisitions and strategic investments, as well as negatively impact our stock price.\nAdditionally, the COVID-19 pandemic could negatively affect our internal control over financial reporting, including as a result of a portion of our personnel working from home. Accordingly, new processes, procedures and controls have been and may continue to be required to respond to changes in our business environment.\nThe potential effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may also impact many of our other risk factors included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The degree to which the pandemic impacts our operations, business, financial results and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain, continuously evolving and in many cases cannot be predicted, including, but not limited to, the duration and spread of the pandemic, its severity, the efficacy of vaccines (particularly with respect to emerging strains of the virus), the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact and how quickly and to what extent normal social, economic and operating conditions can resume.\nWe face significant competition from other service providers, as well as other well-capitalized entrants in the video and data services industry, which could reduce our market share and lower our profits.\nWe operate in a highly competitive, subscriber-driven and rapidly changing industry and compete with a growing number of entities that provide a broad range of communications products, services and content to subscribers. Our competitors have historically included, and we expect will continue to include, DBS providers, telephone companies that offer data and video services through DSL technology or fiber-to-the-node networks, municipalities with fiber-based networks, regional fiber providers and other service providers that have been granted a franchise to operate in a geographic market in which we are already operating.\nOur systems generally operate pursuant to franchises, permits and similar authorizations issued by state and local governments. As these franchises are typically non-exclusive, state and local governments can grant additional franchises to other entities and create competition in our markets where none existed previously, resulting in overbuilds. In some cases, the FCC has adopted rules that streamline entry for new competitors (particularly those affiliated with telephone companies) and reduce franchising burdens for these new entrants. Although as a general matter internet service providers have upgraded their data networks to enable faster upload and download speeds for their customers in metropolitan markets before upgrading their data networks in our markets, approximately 18% of our footprint has been overbuilt by high-speed data service providers offering speeds of 100 Mbps or higher. Prior to 2021, we considered residential broadband download speeds of 50 Mbps or higher as speeds comparable to our own. However, we continue to anticipate a slow yet steady growth of new entrants into our markets. Currently, approximately 12% of the residential homes passed in our markets have access to fiber-to-the-premises from our competitors who typically offer only high-speed data service. Further overbuilding could cause more of our customers to purchase data and video services from our competitors instead of from us. We also face increasing competition from wireless telephone companies for residential voice services, as our customers continue to replace our residential voice services completely with wireless voice services. In addition, new entrants with significant financial resources may compete on a larger scale with our video and data services, and as more wireless voice service providers offer unlimited data options, some customers may choose to forgo our data services altogether. We may also face increasing competition from various providers of wireless internet offerings, including wireless telephone carriers that are developing high-speed \u201c5G\u201d wireless networks and public locations or commercial establishments offering Wi-Fi at no cost.\nCertain municipalities have also announced plans to construct their own data networks with access speeds that match or exceed ours through the use of fiber-to-the-node or fiber-to-the-premises technology. In some cases, local government entities and municipal utilities may legally compete with us without obtaining a franchise from an LFA, reducing their barriers to entry into our markets. The entrance of municipalities as competitors in our markets would add to the competition we face and could lead to additional customer attrition.\nOur video business also faces substantial and increasing competition from other forms of in-home and mobile entertainment, including, among others, Amazon Prime, Apple TV, CBS All Access, Disney+, HBO Max, Hulu, Netflix, Peacock, YouTube TV and an increasing number of new entrants who offer OTT video programming, including many traditional programmers. Because of the significant size and financial resources of many of the companies behind such service offerings, we anticipate that they will continue to invest resources in increasing the availability of video content on the internet, which may result in less demand for the video services we provide. In addition, companies that offer OTT content in certain markets also provide data services, such as Alphabet, and they may seek to increase sales of their streaming content by lowering the cost of data services for their customers, which would further increase price competition for the data services we offer. In addition to creating competition for our video services, OTT content also significantly increases the volume of traffic on our data networks, which can lead to decreases in access speeds for all users if data networks are not upgraded so that their broadband capacity can keep pace with increased traffic.\nCompetition for dedicated fiber-optic services for enterprise business customers is also intense as both local telephone companies and regional overbuilders offer data and voice services over dedicated fiber connections.\nAny of these events could have a material negative impact on our operations, business, financial results and financial condition.\nOur business is characterized by rapid technological change, and if we do not adapt to technological changes and respond appropriately to changes in consumer demand, our competitive position may be harmed.\nOur success is, to a large extent, dependent on our ability to acquire, develop, adopt, upgrade and exploit new and existing technologies to address changing consumer demands and distinguish our services from those of our competitors. We may not be able to accurately predict technological trends or the success of new products and services. If we choose technologies or equipment that are less effective, cost-efficient or attractive to our customers than those chosen by our competitors, or if we offer services that fail to appeal to consumers, that are not available at competitive prices or that do not function as expected, our competitive position could deteriorate and our business and financial results could suffer.\nThe ability of some of our competitors to introduce new technologies, products and services more quickly than we can may adversely affect our competitive position. Furthermore, advances in technology, decreases in the cost of existing technologies or changes in competitors\u2019 product and service offerings may require us in the future to make additional research and development expenditures or to offer at no additional charge or at a lower price certain products and services that we currently offer to customers separately or at a premium.\nIn addition, we generally seek to leverage overall industry experience before rolling out new technology in order to avoid investing in technology that has not been proven successful in other markets. We implement this approach to avoid costly mistakes made by early adopters of new technology that does not provide expected returns, and it exposes us to the risk that one of our competitors will adopt successful new technology before us and leverage this new technology to attract our customers, increasing the level of customer attrition we experience and adversely affecting our business.\nBusiness services sales increasingly contribute to our results of operations, and we face risks as we attempt to further focus on sales to our business customers.\nGrowth in revenue from sales to our business customers in legacy Cable One markets was 6.5% in 2020 after exceeding 10% for each year between 2019 and when we started focusing on business services sales in 2011. During 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic and our associated responses, including business sales associates working from home, resulted in suppressed sales growth from small business customers. We may encounter additional challenges as we continue our initiative to expand sales of data, voice and video services to our business customers. To accommodate this expansion, we expect to commit a greater proportion of our expenditures on technology, equipment and personnel toward our business customers. If we are unable to sufficiently maintain the necessary infrastructure and internal support functions necessary to service these customers, potential future growth of our business services revenues would be limited. In many cases, business customers have service level agreements that require us to provide higher standards of service and reliability. If we are unable to meet our service level requirements, or more broadly, the expectations of our business customers, or if pandemic-related headwinds associated with business sales continue, our business sales may not increase and our results of operations may be materially negatively affected.\nThe increase in programming costs and retransmission fees may continue in the future, resulting in lower margins than we anticipate.\nOver the past few years, the sales margins on our residential video services, which accounted for 25.1%, 28.7% and 32.0% of our total revenues in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, have decreased as a result of increased programming costs and retransmission fees and customer cord-cutting. Programming costs and retransmission fees paid to major programmers and broadcasters may continue to increase as content providers are expected to ask for higher fees. Moreover, programming cost and retransmission fee increases have caused us, and may in the future cause us, to cease carrying channels offered by certain programmers and broadcasters, which may result in attrition of video subscribers as well as customers who subscribe to double-play or triple-play packages that include video service. These customer losses and increased costs could result in further decreases in our residential video margins and adversely impact our business.\nWe may not be able to obtain necessary hardware, software and operational support.\nWe depend on a limited number of third-party suppliers and licensors to supply some of the hardware and software necessary to provide some of our services, including our access to the network backbone, the modems that we lease to our customers and the delivery of our IPTV video service. Some of these vendors represent our sole source of supply or have, either through contract or as a result of intellectual property rights, a position of some exclusivity. If any of these parties breaches or terminates its agreement with us or otherwise fails to perform its obligations in a timely manner; demand exceeds these vendors\u2019 capacity; they experience operating or financial difficulties (including due to general adverse economic conditions); they significantly increase the amount we must pay for necessary products or services or they cease production of any necessary product due to lack of demand, profitability, a change in their ownership or otherwise, then our ability to provide some services may be materially adversely affected. Any of these events could adversely affect our ability to retain and attract subscribers and have a material negative impact on our operations, business, financial results and financial condition.\nWe cannot assure you that the Hargray Acquisition will be completed.\nThere are a number of risks and uncertainties relating to the Hargray Acquisition. For example, the Hargray Acquisition may not be completed, or may not be completed in the timeframe, on the terms or in the manner currently anticipated, as a result of a number of factors, including, among other things, the failure of one or more of the conditions to closing in the Merger Agreement. There can be no assurance that the conditions to closing of the Hargray Acquisition will be satisfied or waived or that other events will not intervene to delay or result in the failure to close the Hargray Acquisition. The Merger Agreement may be terminated by the parties thereto under certain circumstances, including, without limitation, if the Hargray Acquisition has not been completed on or before the six-month anniversary of the Merger Agreement, which period may be extended by one month if all conditions to closing shall have been satisfied or waived (other than conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the closing) other than those relating to certain regulatory approvals.\nWe may fail to realize the benefits anticipated as a result of the Hargray Acquisition.\nThe success of the Hargray Acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated business opportunities and growth prospects from combining Hargray with our business. We may never realize these business opportunities and growth prospects. We may devote significant senior management attention and resources to preparing for and then integrating our business practices and operations with those of Hargray. We may fail to realize some of the anticipated benefits of the Hargray Acquisition if the integration process takes longer than expected or is more costly than expected.\nWe and Hargray will be subject to business uncertainties while the Hargray Acquisition is pending that could adversely affect our and their business.\nUncertainty about the effect of the Hargray Acquisition on associates and customers may have an adverse effect on us and Hargray. Although we and Hargray intend to take actions to reduce any adverse effects, these uncertainties may impair our and their ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the Hargray Acquisition is completed and for a period of time thereafter. These uncertainties could cause customers, suppliers and others that deal with us and/or Hargray to seek to change existing business relationships. In addition, associate retention could be reduced during the pendency of the Hargray Acquisition as associates may experience uncertainty about their future roles. If, despite our and Hargray\u2019s retention efforts, key associates depart because of concerns relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of the integration process or a desire not to remain with us, our business could be harmed.\nWe recently made several acquisitions and strategic investments, and may make other acquisitions and strategic investments, which expose us to risks and uncertainties associated with acquisitions and strategic investments.\nWe completed the NewWave acquisition in May 2017, the Clearwave acquisition in January 2019, the Fidelity acquisition in October 2019 and the MBI investment in November 2020. On February 12, 2021, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the equity interests in Hargray that we do not already own. In addition, we have made and may make other acquisitions and strategic investments (each such acquired business or investee, a \u201cStrategic Acquiree\u201d and, collectively, the \u201cStrategic Acquirees\u201d). Such acquisitions and strategic investments could involve a number of risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u25cf\nuncertainties as to the timing of any acquisition or strategic investment and the risk that such transactions may not be completed in a timely manner or at all;\n\u25cf\nthe possibility that any or all of the conditions to the consummation of any acquisition or strategic investment may not be satisfied or waived, including failure to receive any required regulatory approvals (or any conditions, limitations or restrictions placed in connection with such approvals);\n\u25cf\nuncertainties related to our ability to obtain any necessary financing to complete any acquisition or strategic investment;\n\u25cf\nthe difficulty in integrating new Strategic Acquirees and their operations in an efficient and effective manner;\n\u25cf\nthe challenge in achieving strategic objectives, cost savings and other anticipated benefits;\n\u25cf\nthe potential loss of key associates of a Strategic Acquiree and the difficulties of integrating personnel;\n\u25cf\nthe potential diversion of senior management\u2019s attention from our ongoing operations;\n\u25cf\nthe difficulty of maintaining relationships with the customers, suppliers and other business partners of a Strategic Acquiree;\n\u25cf\nthe potential loss of brand recognition, customer loyalty or reputation from any rebranding efforts;\n\u25cf\nthe difficulty and amount of time necessary to realize expected synergies and other benefits of the acquisitions or strategic investments;\n\u25cf\nthe risks associated with integrating financial reporting and internal control systems as well as with creating uniform standards, procedures, policies and information systems;\n\u25cf\nthe difficulty in adapting and expanding information technology systems and other business processes to incorporate the Strategic Acquirees;\n\u25cf\npotential future impairments of goodwill associated with the Strategic Acquirees;\n\u25cf\nin some cases, the potential for increased regulation;\n\u25cf\nrisks relating to minority ownership positions in our strategic investments, including our initial minority ownership position in MBI, such as our ability to appoint only a minority of members of the board of managers of MBI, the fact that the managers of MBI will not owe the same fiduciary duties to us that directors of a corporation would owe to stockholders and the limited category of transactions for which our consent will be needed under MBI\u2019s operating agreement; and\n\u25cf\nuncertainties related to the exercise of the Call Option or the Put Option (each as defined below) in the MBI investment, including our ability to finance the purchase of the remaining equity interests in MBI on terms acceptable to us or at all.\nIf a Strategic Acquiree fails to operate as anticipated, cannot be successfully integrated with our existing business or other risks and uncertainties, including one or more of the risks and uncertainties identified above, occur in connection with our acquisitions and strategic investments, our operations, business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially negatively affected.\nImplementation of our new ERP system could disrupt business operations.\nWe are planning to implement a new ERP system by the summer of 2021. The implementation requires significant investments of time, money and resources and may result in the diversion of senior management\u2019s attention from our ongoing operations. Furthermore, the implementation will result in changes to many of our existing operational, financial and administrative business processes, including, but not limited to, our budgeting, purchasing, receiving, provisioning, servicing, accounting and reporting processes. The new ERP system will require both the implementation of new internal controls and changes to existing internal control frameworks and procedures. If unexpected delays, such as the unanticipated implementation delay experienced due to the COVID-19 pandemic, technical problems or other significant issues arise in connection with the implementation, it could have a material negative impact on our operations, business, financial results and financial condition.\nWe rely on network and information systems and other technology, and a disruption or failure of such networks, systems or technology as a result of cybersecurity incidents, as well as outages, natural disasters (including extreme weather), pandemics, terrorist attacks, accidental releases of information or similar events, may disrupt our business.\nNetwork and information systems and other technologies are critical to our operating activities, both to internal uses and in supplying data, video and voice services to customers. Network or information system shutdowns or other service disruptions caused by cyber-attacks, such as distributed denial of service attacks, ransomware, dissemination of malware and other malicious activity, pose increasing risks. Both unsuccessful and successful cyber-attacks on companies, including ours, have continued to increase in frequency, scope and potential harm in recent years and, because the techniques used in such attacks have become more sophisticated and change frequently, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. From time to time, third parties make malicious attempts to access our network or the networks of third-party vendors we use. Cyber-attacks could result in an unauthorized release of information, degradation to our network and information systems or disruption to our data, video and voice services, all of which could adversely affect our reputation and results of operations.\nOur network and information systems are also vulnerable to damage or interruption from power outages, natural disasters (including extreme weather arising from short-term weather patterns or any long-term changes), pandemics, terrorist attacks and similar events, and the individuals responsible for such systems may also be imperiled by certain such events. For example, prior to 2018, the damage to our network infrastructure caused by Hurricanes Harvey and Katrina and the Joplin, Missouri tornado each created a significant disruption in our ability to provide services in affected areas. Any similar events could have an adverse impact on us and our customers in the future, including degradation of service, service disruption, excessive call volume to call centers and damage to our plant, equipment, data and reputation. Such an event also could result in large expenditures necessary to repair or replace such networks or information systems or to protect them from similar events or damage in the future. Further, the impacts associated with extreme weather or any long-term changes, such as intensified storm activity, may cause increased business interruptions.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions, including cyber-attacks, and our actual or perceived failure to adequately protect business and consumer data could give rise to liability or reputational harm.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we electronically maintain confidential, proprietary and personal information in our information technology systems and networks and those of third-party vendors, including customer, personnel and vendor data. These systems have been, and may continue to be, targets of attack by cyber criminals or other wrongdoers seeking to steal such information for financial gain or to harm our business operations or reputation. The loss, misuse, compromise, leakage, falsification or accidental release of such information has resulted, and may in the future result, in costly investigations, remediation efforts and notification to affected consumers, personnel and/or vendors. For example, in 2019 we identified an information security incident that could affect the personal information of some of our current and former associates as well as, in some cases, their dependents, beneficiaries and others. Cyber-attacks have consumed, and may in the future consume, internal resources, and they could also adversely affect our operating results and result in government investigations, fines and penalties, litigation or potential liability for us and otherwise harm our business.\nVarious Federal, state and international laws and regulations govern the collection, use, retention, sharing and security of consumer data and sensitive personal information that could be used to commit identity theft. This area of the law is evolving, and interpretations of applicable laws and regulations differ. Legislative and regulatory activity in the privacy area may result in new laws that are relevant to our operations, for example, use of consumer data for marketing or advertising. Claims of failure to comply with our privacy policies or applicable laws or regulations could form the basis of governmental or private-party actions against us. Such claims and actions may cause damage to our reputation and could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe also are subject to stringent data security and data retention requirements that apply to website operators and online services directed to children under 13 years of age, or that knowingly collect or post personal information from children under 13 years of age. Other privacy oriented laws have been extended by courts to online video providers and are increasingly being used in privacy lawsuits, including class actions, against providers of video materials online. Most states have security breach notification laws that generally require a business to give notice to consumers and government agencies when certain information has been disclosed due to a security breach, and the FCC has adopted security breach rules for voice services. Several states have also enacted general data security requirements to safeguard consumer information, including the proper disposal of consumer information. We cannot predict whether, when or to what extent these obligations may impose costs on or otherwise adversely affect our business.\nIntellectual property and proprietary rights of others could prevent us from using necessary technology to provide our services or subject us to expensive intellectual property litigation.\nWe periodically receive claims from third parties alleging that our network and information technology infrastructure infringes the intellectual property rights of others. We are sometimes named as joint defendants in these suits together with other providers of data, video and voice services. Typically, these claims allege that aspects of our system architecture, electronic program guides, modem technology or VoIP services infringe on process patents held by third parties. It is likely that we will continue to be subject to similar claims as they relate to our business. Addressing these claims is a time-consuming and expensive endeavor, regardless of the merits of the claims. In order to resolve such a claim, we could determine the need to change our method of doing business, enter into a licensing agreement or incur substantial monetary liability. It is also possible that our business could be enjoined from using the intellectual property at issue, causing us to significantly alter our operations. If any such claims are successful, then the outcome would likely affect our services utilizing the intellectual property at issue and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nRisks Relating to Regulation and Legislation\nThe profitability of our data service offerings may be impacted by legislative or regulatory efforts to impose net neutrality and other new requirements on cable operators.\nThe majority of our Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures comes from residential data services, and a majority of our residential customers are data-only. We have aligned our resources to emphasize increased sales of data services as well as sales to business customers. In order to continue to generate Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures at our desired level from data services, we need the continued flexibility to develop and refine business models that respond to changing consumer uses and demands and to manage data usage efficiently, including by charging our data subscribers higher rates based on the speed as well as overall bandwidth capacity available to, or used by, them, referred to as \u201cusage-based billing.\u201d Our ability to implement usage-based billing or other network management initiatives in the future may be restricted by any new net neutrality requirements on cable operators.\nTo the extent the FCC in the future limits our ability to price our data services, we may not be able to generate the margins on our data services that we anticipated in shifting our focus from video to data services, and our business could be materially negatively impacted. While the FCC has eliminated most net neutrality requirements, the FCC, Congress, states or the courts may revisit this determination in the future. For example, Congress and numerous states, including Minnesota and Missouri (where we have subscribers) have proposed legislation and/or administrative actions that would lead to increased regulation of our provision of data services, including proposed rules regarding net neutrality. Several states, including Oregon and Washington (where we also have subscribers), have adopted legislation that requires entities providing broadband internet access service in the state to comply with net neutrality requirements or that prohibits state and local government agencies from contracting with internet service providers that engage in certain network management activities based on paid prioritization, content blocking or other discrimination. Further, current rules only require that a portion of revenues from VoIP services be contributed to the USF and USF is not applied to broadband services. The changes brought about by how USF monies are distributed may provide funding and subsidies to those who either compete with us or seek to compete with us and therefore put us at a competitive disadvantage. Moreover, if the FCC imposes USF fees on broadband services, bundled services or a larger portion of VoIP services, it would increase the cost of our services and harm our ability to compete.\nThe regulation of broadband activities, including net neutrality obligations, and any related court decisions could cause us to incur additional compliance costs, restrict our ability to profit from our existing broadband network, limit the return we can expect to achieve on past and future investments in our broadband networks and adversely affect our business. We cannot predict what, if any, proposals might be adopted or what effect they might have on our business.\nOur video and voice services are subject to additional regulation by Federal, state and local authorities, which may impose additional costs and restrictions on our businesses.\nOur video services business operates in a highly regulated environment. Our systems generally operate pursuant to franchises, permits and similar authorizations issued by states or local governments controlling the public rights-of-way, which typically are non-exclusive and limited in time, contain various conditions and limitations and provide for the payment of fees to the local authority, determined generally as a percentage of revenues. Failure to comply with all of the terms and conditions of a franchise may give rise to rights of termination by the franchising authority.\nWe have the ability, pursuant to the Copyright Act, under certain terms and conditions and assuming that any applicable retransmission consents have been obtained, to retransmit the signals of television stations pursuant to a compulsory copyright license. From time to time, revisions to the cable compulsory copyright rules are considered. It is possible that changes in the rules or copyright compulsory license fee computations or compliance procedures could have an adverse effect on our business by, for example, increasing copyright compulsory license fee costs or by causing us to reduce or discontinue carriage of certain broadcast signals that we currently carry on a discretionary basis. Copyright clearances for non-broadcast programming services are arranged through private negotiations. Cable operators also must obtain music rights for locally originated programming and advertising from the major music performing rights organizations. These licensing fees have been the source of litigation in the past, and we cannot predict with certainty whether license fee disputes may arise in the future.\nIn addition, Congress, the FCC and other government agencies have implemented regulations that affect the types of set-top boxes that we can lease or deploy to our subscribers, and we expect these regulations may change in the future. The imposition of energy conservation regulations on the hardware products we provide to our customers could impede innovation and require mandatory upgrades in our set-top boxes and be costly to us. In addition, the FCC may revisit adopting rules requiring any retail video device to work on any cable operator\u2019s system. Various parties continue to advocate to Congress and the administrative agencies for new regulatory approaches to reduce consumer dependency on traditional operator-provided set-top boxes. We cannot predict when, whether or to what extent any of these types of proposals will be adopted or how they will affect our operations.\nOur telecommunications services are subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny, and our interconnected VoIP services are also subject to a growing degree of regulation. Complying with these regulations may increase the costs we incur and decrease the revenues we derive from our voice business. While the compliance costs associated with the current regulatory structure applicable to our voice services are manageable, changes in this regulatory structure are unpredictable and have the potential to further negatively impact our voice services by increasing compliance costs and/or taxes.\nOur cable system franchises are subject to non-renewal or termination. The failure to renew a franchise in one or more markets could adversely affect our business.\nMany of the LFAs from whom we have obtained franchises, permits and similar authorizations required to operate our video services business have established comprehensive facilities and service requirements as well as specific customer service standards and monetary penalties for non-compliance. In many cases, our franchises are terminable if we fail to comply with significant provisions set forth in the applicable franchise agreement governing our video operations. Franchises are generally granted for fixed terms and must be periodically renewed. LFAs may resist granting a renewal if either past performance or the prospective operating proposal is considered inadequate. LFAs often demand concessions or other commitments as a condition to renewal. The traditional cable franchising regime has undergone significant change as a result of various Federal and state actions. Some state franchising laws do not allow us to immediately opt into favorable statewide franchising. In many cases, state franchising laws will result in fewer franchise-imposed requirements for our competitors who are new entrants than for us, until we are able to opt into the applicable state franchise. We cannot assure that we will be able to comply with all significant provisions of our franchise agreements and certain of our franchisers have from time to time alleged that we have not complied with these agreements. Additionally, although historically we have renewed our franchises without incurring significant costs, we cannot assure that we will be able to renew, or to renew as favorably, our franchises in the future. A termination of or a sustained failure to renew a franchise in one or more markets could materially negatively affect our business in the affected geographic area.\nIn addition, certain of our franchise agreements require that the applicable LFA approve a transfer of control of the Company. Although FCC rules provide that a transfer application shall be deemed granted if it is not acted upon within 120 days after submission, as a practical matter, cable operators often waive the deadline if the LFA has not completed its review to facilitate discussions and thereby avoid an LFA denying the transfer of control. Failure to obtain such consents on commercially reasonable and satisfactory terms may impair our entitlement to the benefit of these franchise agreements in the event of a potential transfer of control of the Company.\nWe may encounter increased pole attachment costs.\nFederal law requires most telephone companies and electric power utilities owning utility poles to provide cable systems with access to poles and underground conduits. Federal law also requires those utilities to charge reasonable rates to cable operators for utilizing space on such poles or in such underground conduits. The FCC\u2019s pole attachment rules contain a formula for calculating pole rental rates that provide for similar rates for telecommunications attachments and cable attachments and prohibit utility companies from charging higher rates for pole attachments used to provide broadband internet access service. The FCC has also adopted rules to facilitate new attachments, including a one-touch make-ready procedure for new attachments. As a general matter, changes to our pole attachment rate structure could significantly increase our annual pole attachment costs and materially negatively impact our operations, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in broadcast carriage regulations could impose significant additional costs.\nAlthough we would likely choose to carry all primary video feeds of local broadcast stations in the markets in which we operate voluntarily, so-called \u201cmust carry\u201d rules could, in the future, require us to carry some local broadcast television signals on some of our systems that we might not otherwise carry. If the FCC seeks to revise or expand the \u201cmust carry\u201d rules, such as to require carriage of multicast streams, we would be forced to carry video programming that we would not otherwise carry and potentially drop other, more popular programming in order to free capacity for the required programming, which could make us less competitive. Moreover, if the FCC adopts rules that are not competitively neutral, cable operators could be placed at a disadvantage versus other video providers.\nThe FCC recently took steps to relax its media ownership rules, including restrictions on the number of commonly owned television stations per market as well as on newspaper/broadcast and radio/television station cross-ownership. However, the FCC\u2019s new rules were overturned by a Federal court, which remanded the matter to the FCC for further proceedings. The matter is now pending before the U.S. Supreme Court. We cannot predict the outcome of the ongoing reviews by the FCC and the courts, and whether or to what extent any further revisions of the rules by the FCC or the courts may affect our operations or impose costs on our business. Changes to relax the media ownership rules would likely lead to increased consolidation of the television broadcast stations and station groups, with a corresponding increase in the negotiating leverage that broadcasters and station groups hold in retransmission consent negotiations, thereby possibly increasing the amounts we pay to broadcasters for retransmission consent.\nAdditional government-mandated broadcast carriage obligations, including those related to the FCC\u2019s enhanced technical broadcasting option (Advanced Television Systems Committee 3.0), could disrupt existing programming commitments and increase our costs of carrying such programming.\nRisks Relating to Our Indebtedness\nWe have incurred indebtedness, including in connection with various acquisitions, and the degree to which we are now leveraged may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations and cash flows.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $2.2 billion of outstanding indebtedness. Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, including the debt incurred in connection with acquisitions, as well as any future debt that we may incur, will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future from operations, financings or asset sales. Our ability to generate cash is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors, some of which are beyond our control.\nThe terms of our indebtedness restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to incur debt that we may need to fund initiatives in response to changes in our business, the industries in which we operate, the economy and governmental regulations.\nThe terms of our indebtedness include a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and limit our ability to engage in actions that may be in our long-term best interests. These may restrict our ability to take some or all of the following actions:\n\u25cf\nincur or guarantee additional indebtedness or sell disqualified or preferred stock;\n\u25cf\npay dividends on, make distributions in respect of, repurchase or redeem, capital stock;\n\u25cf\nmake acquisitions or investments;\n\u25cf\nsell, transfer or otherwise dispose of certain assets;\n\u25cf\ncreate or allow to exist liens;\n\u25cf\nenter into sale/leaseback transactions;\n\u25cf\nenter into agreements restricting the ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany transfers;\n\u25cf\nconsolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our or our subsidiaries\u2019 assets;\n\u25cf\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u25cf\nprepay, repurchase or redeem certain kinds of indebtedness;\n\u25cf\nissue or sell stock of our subsidiaries; and/or\n\u25cf\nsignificantly change the nature of our business.\nAs a result of all of these restrictions, we may be:\n\u25cf\nlimited in how we conduct our business and pursue our strategy;\n\u25cf\nunable to raise additional debt financing to operate during general economic or business downturns; or\n\u25cf\nunable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities, including acquisitions and strategic investments.\nA breach of any of these covenants, if applicable, could result in an event of default under the terms of our indebtedness. If an event of default occurs, the lenders would have the right to accelerate the repayment of such debt and the event of default or acceleration may result in the acceleration of the repayment of any other of our debt to which a cross-default or cross-acceleration provision applies. Furthermore, the lenders of this indebtedness may require that we pledge our assets as collateral as security for our repayment obligations. If we were unable to repay any amount of this indebtedness when due and payable, the lenders could proceed against the collateral that secures this indebtedness. In the event our creditors accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we may not have sufficient assets to repay such indebtedness and our financial condition will be materially negatively affected.\nWe have variable rate indebtedness that subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nAs of the end of 2020, we had approximately $1.5 billion of outstanding term loans and an additional $470.4 million of undrawn revolving credit capacity with variable rates of interest that expose us to interest rate risks. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remains the same, and our net income and cash flows will correspondingly decrease. In addition, we will be exposed to the risk of rising interest rates to the extent that we fund our operations with additional short-term or variable-rate borrowings. We have entered into and in the future may enter into additional interest rate swaps in order to hedge against future interest rate volatility. We may elect not to maintain such interest rate swaps with respect to our variable rate indebtedness, if any, and any swaps we have entered into or may enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk. As a result, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially negatively affected.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock and the Securities Market\nWe cannot assure you that we will continue to pay dividends on our common stock, and our indebtedness limits our ability to pay dividends on our common stock.\nThe timing, declaration, amount and payment of future dividends to stockholders falls within the discretion of our Board. Our Board\u2019s decisions regarding the amount and payment of future dividends will depend on many factors, including our financial condition, earnings, capital requirements of our business and covenants associated with debt obligations, as well as legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice and other factors that our Board deems relevant. There can be no assurance that we will continue to pay any dividend in the future.\nCertain provisions in our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-laws and Delaware law may discourage takeovers and the concentration of ownership of our common stock will affect the voting results of matters submitted for stockholder approval.\nSeveral provisions of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, Amended and Restated By-laws and Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that is opposed by our Board or certain stockholders holding a significant percentage of the voting power of our outstanding voting stock. These include provisions that:\n\u25cf\nprior to the full declassification of our board following our annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2023, divide our Board into three classes of directors, standing for election on a staggered basis, such that only approximately one-third of the directors constituting our Board may change each year;\n\u25cf\ndo not permit our stockholders to act by written consent and require that stockholder action must take place at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders;\n\u25cf\nprovide that only our Chief Executive Officer and a majority of our directors, and not our stockholders, may call a special meeting of our stockholders;\n\u25cf\nrequire the approval of our Board or the affirmative vote of stockholders holding at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of our capital stock to amend our Amended and Restated By-laws; and\n\u25cf\nlimit our ability to enter into business combination transactions with certain stockholders.\nThese and other provisions of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, Amended and Restated By-laws and Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent certain types of transactions involving an actual or a threatened acquisition or change in control of the Company, including unsolicited takeover attempts, even though the transaction may offer our stockholders the opportunity to sell their shares of our common stock at a price above the prevailing market price.\nOur Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, associates or stockholders.\nOur Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that, subject to limited exceptions, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for any (i) derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company, (ii) action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or associate of the Company to the Company or the Company\u2019s stockholders, (iii) action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \u201cDGCL\u201d) or (iv) action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the provisions of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation described above. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other associates, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and associates. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nAdverse conditions in the U.S. economy could impact our results of operations.\nUnfavorable general economic conditions, such as a recession or economic slowdown in the United States and the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, could negatively affect the affordability of and demand for some of our products and services. In difficult economic conditions, consumers may seek to reduce discretionary spending by forgoing purchases of our products and services, electing to use fewer higher margin products and services or obtaining lower cost products and services offered by other companies. Similarly, under these conditions the business customers that we serve in the United States may delay purchasing decisions, delay full implementation of service offerings or reduce their use of services. In addition, adverse economic conditions may lead to an increased number of our residential and business customers that are unable to pay for services. If any of these events were to occur, it could have a material negative effect on our operations, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur stock price may fluctuate significantly, depending on many factors, some of which may be beyond our control.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, depending on many factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including:\n\u25cf\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results due to factors related to our business;\n\u25cf\nsuccess or failure of our business strategies;\n\u25cf\nour quarterly or annual earnings, or those of other companies in our industry;\n\u25cf\nour ability to obtain financing as needed;\n\u25cf\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, dispositions or strategic investments;\n\u25cf\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u25cf\nthe failure of securities analysts to cover, or maintain coverage of, our common stock;\n\u25cf\nchanges in earnings estimates by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates;\n\u25cf\nthe operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies;\n\u25cf\ninvestor perception of the Company and our industry;\n\u25cf\noverall market fluctuations;\n\u25cf\nresults from any material litigation or government investigation;\n\u25cf\nchanges in laws and regulations (including tax laws and regulations) affecting our business;\n\u25cf\nchanges in capital gains taxes and taxes on dividends affecting stockholders; and\n\u25cf\ngeneral economic conditions and other external factors.\nLow trading volume for our stock, which may occur if an active trading market is not sustained, among other reasons, would amplify the effect of the above factors on our stock price volatility.\nStock markets in general can experience volatility that is unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company. These broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nYour percentage ownership in the Company may be diluted in the future.\nYour percentage ownership in the Company may be diluted in the future because of equity awards granted, and that we expect to grant in the future, to our directors, officers and other associates. In addition, we may issue equity as all or part of the financing or consideration paid for acquisitions and strategic investments that we may make in the future or as necessary to fund our ongoing operations.\nAny damage to our reputation or brand image could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nMaintaining a positive reputation and brand image are important factors impacting our ability to sell our products and services. The speed at which negative publicity is disseminated has increased dramatically through the use of electronic communication, including social media, websites and blogs. Our success in maintaining our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to this rapidly changing media environment. Adverse publicity or negative commentary in any media outlet could damage our reputation and reduce the demand for our products and services, which would adversely affect our business. Our reputation or brand image could be adversely impacted by negative publicity, commentary or communications (whether or not valid), including related to the following topics: our failure to maintain high ethical and social practices in all of our operations and activities; our failure to be perceived as appropriately addressing matters of social responsibility; our use of social media; or public perception of statements or positions made or taken by us, including our executives and associates.\nIf we are unable to retain key associates, our ability to manage our business could be adversely affected.\nOur operational results have depended, and our future results will depend, upon the retention and continued performance of our management team. The competitive environment for management talent in the broadband communications industry could adversely impact our ability to retain and hire new key associates for management positions. The loss of the services of key members of management and the inability or delay in hiring new key associates could adversely affect our ability to manage our business and our future operational and financial results.\nOur ability to incur future indebtedness, whether for general corporate purposes or for acquisitions and strategic investments, may not be available on favorable terms, or at all.\nWe may need to seek additional financing for our general corporate purposes or for acquisitions and strategic investments in the future. We may be unable to obtain additional indebtedness on terms favorable to us, or at all, including because of the terms of our current indebtedness. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to fund our future activities, which could negatively affect our business. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities, our stockholders could experience dilution of their ownership interest. If we raise additional funds by issuing debt, we may be subject to limitations on our operations due to restrictive covenants.\nOur Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation includes provisions limiting the personal liability of our directors for breaches of fiduciary duty under the DGCL.\nOur Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation contains a provision permitted under the DGCL relating to the liability of directors. This provision eliminates a director\u2019s personal liability to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL for monetary damages resulting from a breach of fiduciary duty; provided that such provision will not eliminate or limit a director\u2019s liability:\n\u25cf\nfor any breach of the director\u2019s duty of loyalty;\n\u25cf\nfor acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of the law;\n\u25cf\nunder Section 174 of the DGCL (including for unlawful dividends); or\n\u25cf\nfor any transaction from which the director derives an improper personal benefit.\nThe principal effect of the limitation on liability provision is that a stockholder will be unable to prosecute an action for monetary damages against a director unless the stockholder can demonstrate a basis for liability for which indemnification is not available under the DGCL. This provision, however, should not limit or eliminate our rights or any stockholder\u2019s rights to seek non-monetary relief, such as an injunction or rescission, in the event of a breach of a director\u2019s fiduciary duty. This provision will not alter a director\u2019s liability under federal securities laws. The inclusion of this provision in our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation may discourage or deter stockholders or management from bringing a lawsuit against directors for a breach of their fiduciary duties, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise have benefited us and our stockholders.", "PERMNO": 15395, "SIC": 4841, "TIC": "CABO"}
