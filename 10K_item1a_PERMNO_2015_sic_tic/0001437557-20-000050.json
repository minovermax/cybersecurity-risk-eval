{"cik": "1437557", "company": "LILIS ENERGY, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-04-30", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider all of the risks described in this Annual Report, in addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report. If any of the following risks, or any risk described elsewhere in this Annual Report, actually occur, our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In any such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nFailure to comply with any of the financial covenants contained in our Revolving Credit Agreement could cause an event of default and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur Revolving Credit Agreement (hereinafter defined and described in more detail) requires the Company to maintain a ratio of Total Debt to EBITDAX (each as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement) (the \u201cLeverage Ratio\u201d) of not more than 4.00 to 1.00 and a ratio of Current Assets to Current Liabilities (each as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement) (the \u201cCurrent Ratio\u201d) of not less than 1.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report for a more detailed description of these financial covenants. Failure to comply with these covenants could cause an event of default under our Revolving Credit Agreement and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAs of March 31, 2020, the Company was not in compliance with the Leverage Ratio and Current Ratio covenants. Pursuant to the Fourteenth Amendment (as defined in Note 11 - Long-Term Debt), the Company obtained a waiver from the requisite lenders of its compliance with the Leverage Ratio and Current Ratio covenants as of March 31, 2020. A failure to comply with the covenants, ratios or tests in our Revolving Credit Agreement, or any future indebtedness, including borrowing base deficiency payments, could result in an event of default. If an event of default occurs and is not cured or waived, our lenders, (i) would not be required to lend any additional amounts to us, (ii) could elect to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees to be due and payable, (iii) could require us to apply all of our available cash to repay these borrowings and (iv) could prevent us from making debt service payments under our other agreements. A potential event of default and subsequent acceleration of indebtedness would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe have identified conditions and events that raise doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe have incurred losses and negative cash flows from operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 and, as of December 31, 2019, and we had a stockholders\u2019 deficit of $238.2 million. We anticipate negative operating cash flows to continue for the foreseeable future due to, among other things, significant uncertainty in the outlook for oil and gas development and external market pressures due to the effects of pandemics, epidemics and other global health concerns such as the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the worldwide economy and global demand for oil and gas that are not within our control. For example, the price of oil and natural gas has fallen significantly since the beginning of 2020, due in part to failed OPEC negotiations and to concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic, which has significantly decreased worldwide demand for oil. As of December 31, 2019, our cash and cash equivalents was $3.8 million and our working capital deficit was $143.5 million. As of December 31, 2019, the Company was not in compliance with the Leverage Ratio and Current Ratio covenants. Pursuant to the Twelfth Amendment (as defined in Note 11 - Long-Term Debt), the Company obtained a waiver from the requisite lenders of its compliance with the Leverage Ratio and Current Ratio covenants, among other waivers of default, as of December 31, 2019. In addition, we currently have no availability for borrowing under our Revolving Credit Agreement.\nAs of March 31, 2020, the Company was not in compliance with the Leverage Ratio and Current Ratio covenants. Pursuant to the Fourteenth Amendment (as defined in Note 11 - Long-Term Debt), the Company obtained a waiver from the requisite lenders of its compliance with the Leverage Ratio and Current Ratio covenants as of March 31, 2020. The Company does not expect to be in compliance with debt covenants in future periods without additional sources of liquidity or future amendments to the Revolving Credit Agreement.\nWe have been unable to secure further sources of liquidity, and as a result, substantial doubt exists about our ability to continue as a going concern as of the date of the filing of this Annual Report and our auditors have included a going concern paragraph in their Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be different should we be unable to continue as a going concern based on the outcome of these uncertainties described above. If we are unable to continue as a going concern, we may have to liquidate our assets and may receive less than the value at which those assets are carried on our audited financial statements, and it is likely\nthat investors will lose all or a part of their investment. See Note 2 - Liquidity and Going Concern to our consolidated financial statements included in \u201cItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d in this Annual Report for further detail.\nOur ability to continue as a \u201cgoing concern\u201d contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business, including the effective implementation and success of management\u2019s plans to mitigate the conditions that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report have been presented on the basis that we would continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. Our liquidity and ability to comply with debt covenants under our Revolving Credit Agreement have been negatively impacted by the recent decrease in commodity prices, which have fallen significantly since the beginning of 2020, due in part to failed OPEC negotiations as well as concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the worldwide economy and global demand for oil and gas. As of March 31, 2020, the Company was not in compliance with the Leverage Ratio and Current Ratio covenants and the Company will not be in compliance in future periods without additional sources of liquidity. Pursuant to the Fourteenth Amendment (as defined in Note 11 - Long-Term Debt Concern to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report), the Company obtained a waiver from the requisite lenders of its compliance with the Leverage Ratio and Current Ratio covenants as of March 31, 2020. The uncertainty related to our continued operations, liquidity, and compliance with the financial covenants under our Revolving Credit Agreement raises substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not reflect any adjustments that might result if we are unable to continue as a going concern.\nIn order to continue to improve our leverage position and current ratio to meet the financial covenants under the Revolving Credit Agreement and satisfy the borrowing base deficiency payment, we are currently pursuing or considering a number of actions, which in certain cases may require the consent of current lenders and stockholders. In November 2019, our board of directors formed a committee of independent directors (the \u201cSpecial Committee\u201d) tasked with reviewing and evaluating strategic alternatives that may enhance the value of the Company, including alternatives that may be available to identify and access further sources of liquidity. The Special Committee hired financial and legal advisors to advise the Special Committee on these matters.\nThe Special Committee continues to explore other financing alternatives and deleveraging transactions. We are also addressing operational matters such as adjusting our capital budget and improving cash flows from operations by continuing to reduce costs, and we intend to continue to pursue and consider other strategic alternatives.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to implement any of these plans successfully, or that such plans, if executed, will result in compliance with our Revolving Credit Agreement covenants or allow us to continue as a going concern.\nOil, natural gas and NGL prices are highly volatile. If commodity prices continue to experience substantial decline, our operations, financial condition, and level of expenditures for the development of our oil, natural gas and NGL reserves may continue to be materially and adversely affected.\nThe prices we receive for our oil, natural gas, and NGL production heavily influence our revenue, operating results, profitability, access to capital, future rate of growth and carrying value of our properties. Oil, natural gas, and NGLs are commodities, and, therefore, their prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand.\nHistorically, the commodities markets have been volatile, and these markets will likely continue to be volatile in the future. The price of oil has fallen approximately $43.00 a barrel based on WTI from December 31, 2019 to the date of this Annual Report, due in part to failed OPEC negotiations as well as concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic, which has significantly decreased worldwide demand for oil. If these reduced prices continue or if prices of oil, natural gas and NGLs experience additional substantial decline, our operations, financial condition and level of expenditures for the development of our oil, natural gas and NGL reserves may continue to be materially and adversely affected. The prices we receive for our production, and the levels of our production, depend on numerous factors beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in global supply and demand for oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nthe ability and willingness of the OPEC and non-OPEC countries, such as Russia, to set and maintain production levels and prices for oil and the other actions of OPEC;\n\u2022\nthe price and quantity of imports of foreign oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\npolitical conditions, including embargoes, affecting oil-producing activity;\n\u2022\nthe level of global oil and natural gas exploration and production activity;\n\u2022\nthe level of global oil and natural gas inventories;\n\u2022\nweather conditions;\n\u2022\ntechnological advances affecting energy consumption\n\u2022\nthe price and availability of alternative fuels; and\n\u2022\nepidemics, pandemics or other major public health issues, such as COVID-19.\nOur revenues, operating results, profitability and future rate of growth depend primarily upon the prices we receive for oil and, to a lesser extent, natural gas that we sell. Prices also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow money or raise additional capital. In addition, we may be required to record asset carrying value write-downs if prices remain low. The current low prices of oil and natural gas or an additional significant decline in the prices of oil and natural gas will adversely affect our financial position, financial results, cash flows, access to capital and ability to grow.\nWe are analyzing and evaluating strategic alternatives to address our capital structure and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying, undertaking or completing any strategic alternative, that any such strategic alternative will address our capital structure and not have a negative impact on our stockholders or that the process will not have an adverse impact on our business.\nIn November 2019, we formed the Special Committee as part of a process to analyze and evaluate various strategic alternatives to address our capital structure and to position us for future success. The Special Committee continues to explore other financing alternatives and deleveraging transactions. The process of reviewing strategic alternatives may be time consuming and disruptive to our business operations and, if we are unable to effectively manage the process, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. We could incur substantial expenses associated with identifying and evaluating potential strategic alternatives. No decision has been made with respect to any strategic alternative and we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify, undertake and complete any strategic alternative that will address our capital structure and not have a negative impact on our stockholders or provide any guidance on the timing of such action, if any.\nAny potential strategic alternative would be dependent upon a number of factors that may be beyond our control. We do not intend to comment regarding the evaluation of strategic alternatives until such time as we have determined that further disclosure is necessary or appropriate. As a consequence, perceived uncertainties related to our future may result in the loss of potential business opportunities and may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners.\nOur level of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and prevent us from meeting our obligations under our indebtedness.\nWe entered into the Revolving Credit Agreement in 2018. As of December 31, 2019, $115.0 million was outstanding under our Revolving Credit Agreement. As provided for in the Seventh Amendment to the Revolving Credit Agreement, and as a result of a decrease in commodity prices, on January 17, 2020, the borrowing base was decreased to $90.0 million. The reduction in the borrowing base resulted in a borrowing base deficiency of $25.0 million. We have made scheduled repayments of $17.3 million and pursuant to the Fourteenth Amendment to the Revolving Credit Agreement, the remaining $7.8 million is due on June 5, 2020.\nWe may incur additional debt, including secured indebtedness, or issue preferred stock in order to maintain adequate liquidity and develop and acquire properties to the extent desired. If we are able to utilize our credit facilities in the future or if we obtain additional financing, our level of indebtedness could affect our operations, including limiting our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes. Additionally, if we increase our indebtedness, the debt service requirements of the additional indebtedness could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations; and a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations would be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness and would not be available for other purposes, including our operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities. A higher level of indebtedness and/or preferred stock also increases the risk that we may default on our obligations.\nThe UK\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, or FCA, which regulates LIBOR, stated on July 27, 2017, that following 2021 it will no longer encourage panel banks to contribute to LIBOR, as it has done to date. Borrowings under our Revolving Credit Agreement bear interest at a floating rate of either LIBOR or a specified base rate plus a margin determined based upon the usage of the borrowing base. In the event LIBOR becomes unavailable prior to the maturity of our Revolving Credit Agreement, the rate of interest payable on our Revolving Credit Agreement may change. Uncertainty regarding the future of or changes to LIBOR or the unavailability of LIBOR could adversely affect our financial condition.\nThe Revolving Credit Agreement and Second Lien Credit Agreement, guaranteed and further secured by substantially all our assets, contain restrictive covenants that may limit our ability to respond to changes in market conditions or pursue business opportunities.\nOur Revolving Credit Agreement and Second Lien Credit Agreement contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\ncreate additional liens;\n\u2022\nincur fundamental changes;\n\u2022\nsell certain of our assets;\n\u2022\nmerge or consolidate with another entity;\n\u2022\npay dividends or make other distributions;\n\u2022\nengage in transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022\nenter into certain swap agreements.\nThe requirement that we comply with these provisions may have a material adverse effect on our ability to react to changes in market conditions, take advantage of business opportunities we believe to be desirable, obtain future financing, fund needed capital expenditures or withstand a continuing or future downturn in our business.\nWe may from time to time enter into alternative or additional debt agreements that contain restrictive covenants that may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business, require us to sell assets or take other actions to reduce indebtedness to meet such covenants, or make it difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy or effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted.\nIn addition, our Revolving Credit Agreement requires us to maintain certain financial ratios. We may from time to time be out of compliance with covenants under our debt agreements, which will require us to seek waivers from our lenders. In connection with the preparation of this Annual Report and the associated financial statements, the Company became aware, and promptly informed its Lenders, that it did not satisfy the current ratio and leverage ratio covenants in the Revolving Credit Agreement, as of the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2019. Accordingly, the Company requested that our lenders consent to a waiver with respect to such provision. On March 30, 2020, the Company entered into that certain Twelfth Amendment and Waiver to Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, whereby our lenders granted a waiver with respect to the breach of the leverage ratio and current ratio covenants, among other waivers of default. As of March 31, 2020, the Company was not in compliance with the Leverage Ratio and Current Ratio covenants. Pursuant to the Fourteenth Amendment (as defined in Note 11 - Long-Term Debt), the Company obtained a waiver from the requisite lenders of its compliance with the Leverage Ratio and Current Ratio covenants as of March 31, 2020. If we fail to comply with these provisions or other financial and operating covenants in the Revolving Credit Agreement, we could be in default under the terms of the agreement. In the event of such default, our lenders could elect to declare all the funds borrowed thereunder to be due and payable, together with the accrued and unpaid interest, and the lenders under or Revolving Credit Agreement could elect to terminate their commitments thereunder.\nIf we are unable to access additional capital, it could negatively impact our production, our income and ultimately our ability to retain our leases.\nOur principal sources of liquidity historically have been equity contributions, borrowings under our credit facilities, net cash provided by operating activities, and net proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock. Our capital program may require additional financing above the level of cash generated by our operations to fund our growth. If our expected cash flow from operations decreases as a result of lower commodity prices or otherwise, our ability to expend the capital necessary to replace our proved reserves, maintain our leasehold acreage or maintain production may be limited, resulting in decreased production and proved reserves over time.\nWe plan to finance our capital expenditures with cash on hand, cash flow from operations and future issuances of debt and/or equity securities. Our cash flow from operations and access to capital is subject to a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nour estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves;\n\u2022\nthe amount of oil and natural gas we produce from existing wells;\n\u2022\nthe prices at which we sell our production;\n\u2022\nthe costs of developing and producing our oil and natural gas reserves;\n\u2022\nour ability to acquire, locate and produce new reserves;\n\u2022\nthe ability and willingness of banks to lend to us; and\n\u2022\nour ability to access the equity and debt capital markets.\nOur operations and capital resources may not provide cash in sufficient funds to maintain planned or future levels of capital expenditures. Further, our actual capital expenditures in 2020 could exceed our capital expenditure budget. In the event our capital expenditure requirements at any time are greater than the amount of capital we have available, we could be required to seek additional sources of capital, which may include refinancing existing debt, joint venture partnerships, production payment financings, offerings of debt or equity securities or other means.\nOur undeveloped leasehold acreage with expiration dates in 2020 at December 31, 2019 was 5,670 net acres and will expire if the Company does not obtain necessary funding to either extend the leases or begin drilling before their expiration dates. As a result, we have recorded an impairment of unproved leasehold of $56.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nAs of the date of this Annual Report, leases holding 1,285 net acres in Reeves County and 593 net acres in Winkler County have expired in 2020. We have additional acreage that may expire depending on the timing and availability of capital for continued development of our leasehold acreage and lease renewals.\nV\u00e4rde Partners, Inc., its portfolio companies, and its affiliates (collectively, \u201cV\u00e4rde\u201d) beneficially own a significant portion of our common stock. V\u00e4rde is not limited in their ability to compete with us, and the waiver of the corporate opportunity provisions in the certificates of designation relating to our Series C Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock, Series E Preferred Stock, and Series F Preferred Stock, may allow V\u00e4rde to benefit from corporate opportunities that might otherwise be available to us. As a result, conflicts of interest could arise in the future between us and V\u00e4rde concerning conflicts over our operations or business opportunities.\nV\u00e4rde is a family of private investment funds that beneficially owns a significant portion of our common stock as a result of the conversion rights available to them under the Series E Preferred Stock (as hereinafter defined and described). V\u00e4rde also has investments in other companies in the energy industry. The certificates of designation governing the preferences, rights and limitations of the Series E Preferred Stock provide that V\u00e4rde is not restricted from owning assets or engaging in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. In particular, subject to the limitations of applicable law, if V\u00e4rde, or any agent, shareholder, member, partner, director, officer, employee, investment manager or investment advisor of V\u00e4rde who is also one of our directors or officers, becomes aware of a potential business opportunity, transaction or other matter, they will have no duty to communicate or offer that opportunity to us.\nAs such, V\u00e4rde may become aware, from time to time, of certain business opportunities (such as acquisition opportunities) and may direct such opportunities to other businesses in which they have invested, in which case those opportunities may not be available to us or may be more expensive for us to pursue. Additionally, any actual or perceived conflicts of interest with respect to the foregoing could have an adverse impact on the trading price of our common stock. As of March 5, 2019, we converted our outstanding Second Lien Loans under our Second Lien Credit Agreement to a combination of two newly created series of preferred stock, Series E convertible preferred stock (\u201cSeries E Preferred Stock\u201d) and Series F non-convertible preferred stock (\u201cSeries F Preferred Stock\u201d), and common stock and eliminated the conversion features and voting rights on our existing Series C Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred Stock, reducing potential dilution of our common stockholders. Our Series E Preferred Stock is convertible and, if converted, could result in dilution to our common stockholders.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting may not detect errors or potential acts of fraud.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls may not prevent all possible errors and fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance that the objectives of the control system are being met. In addition, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls are evaluated relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of our controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Because of inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur without detection, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFailure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting may have an adverse effect on our stock price.\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC to implement Section 404, our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, we are required to conduct an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on framework of internal control issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (\u201cCOSO\u201d). Because of its inherent limitations, internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. In addition, projections of any evaluation effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud. If we cannot provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports and effectively prevent fraud, our reputation and operating results could be harmed. Further, the complexities of our quarter-end and year-end closing processes increase the risk that a weakness in internal controls over financial reporting may go undetected. Therefore, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements.\nA material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting could adversely impact our ability to provide timely and accurate financial information. If we are unable to report financial information timely and accurately or to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures, we could be subject to, among other things, regulatory or enforcement actions by the SEC and the NYSE American, including a delisting from the NYSE American, securities litigation, debt rating agency downgrades or rating withdrawals, any one of which could adversely affect the valuation of our common stock and could adversely affect our business prospects.\nDecreases in oil and natural gas prices may require us to take write-downs of the carrying values of our oil and natural gas properties, potentially requiring earlier than anticipated debt repayment and negatively impacting the trading value of our securities.\nAccounting rules require that we periodically review the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties for possible impairment through the performance of a ceiling test. Based on specific market factors and circumstances at the time of prospective impairment reviews, and the continuing evaluation of development plans, production data, economics and other factors, we may be required to write down the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties.\nWe perform the ceiling test at least quarterly and, in the event capitalized costs of the full cost pool exceed this ceiling, we would recognize an impairment expense. We recognized an impairment expense of approximately $228.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. We did not recognize an impairment expense for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nFuture write-downs will likely occur for reasons, including, but not limited to, continued reductions in oil and natural gas prices that lower the estimate of future net revenues from proved oil and natural gas reserves, revisions to reserves estimates, or from the addition of non-productive capitalized costs to the full cost pool that do not result in a corresponding increase in oil and natural gas reserves. Impairments of plugging and abandonment of wells in progress are other areas where costs may be capitalized into the full cost pool, without any corresponding increase in reserves values. As such, these situations could result in additional impairment expenses in the future. Impairment charges would not affect cash flow from operating activities but could have a material adverse effect on our net income and stockholders\u2019 equity.\nOur estimated reserves are based on many assumptions that may prove inaccurate. Any significant inaccuracies in our reserves estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves.\nOil and natural gas reserves engineering requires subjective estimates of underground accumulations of oil and natural gas and assumptions concerning future oil and natural gas prices, production levels, and operating and development costs. As a result, estimated quantities of proved reserves and projections of future production rates and the timing of development expenditures may prove to be inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in these reserves estimates or underlying assumptions could materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nIn order to prepare estimates, we must project production rates and the timing of development expenditures and analyze available geological, geophysical, production and engineering data. The extent, quality and reliability of this data can vary. The process also requires economic assumptions about matters such as oil and natural gas prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. Although the reserve information contained herein is reviewed by independent reserve engineers, estimates of oil and natural gas reserves are inherently imprecise.\nFurther, the present value of future net cash flows from proved reserves may not be the current market value of estimated oil and natural gas reserves. If our reserves estimates or the underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, it could have a negative impact on our earnings and net income, as well as the trading price of our securities.\nHedging transactions may limit our potential gains or result in losses.\nIn order to comply with the requirements of our Revolving Credit Agreement and to manage our exposure to price risks in the marketing of our oil and natural gas, we have entered into derivative contracts that economically hedge our oil and natural gas price on a portion of our production. These contracts may limit our potential gains if oil and natural gas prices were to rise substantially over the price established by the contract. In addition, such transactions may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which there is a change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the hedging agreement and actual prices received; our production and/or sales of oil or natural gas are less than expected; payments owed under derivative hedging contracts come due prior to receipt of the hedged month\u2019s production revenue; or the other party to the hedging contract defaults on its contract obligations.\nHedging transactions that we have entered into, or may enter into in the future, may not adequately protect us from declines in the prices of oil and natural gas. In addition, the counterparties under our current or future derivatives contracts may fail to fulfill their contractual obligations to us.\nOur identified drilling locations are scheduled to be drilled over a period of several years, making them susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of our drilling.\nOur management has specifically identified and scheduled drilling locations as an estimation of future multi-year drilling activities on our existing acreage. These scheduled drilling locations represent a significant component of our growth strategy. Our ability to drill and develop these locations depends on a number of uncertainties, including oil and natural gas prices, the availability of capital, costs, drilling results, and regulatory approvals. Because of these uncertainties, we do not know if the potential drilling locations previously identified will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce oil or natural gas from our potential drilling locations. As such, actual drilling activities may materially differ from those presently identified, which could adversely affect our business.\nDrilling for and producing oil and natural gas is a speculative activity and involves numerous risks and substantial and uncertain costs that could adversely affect us.\nOur success will depend on the success of our drilling program. There is no way to predict in advance of drilling and testing whether any particular prospect will yield oil or natural gas in sufficient quantities to recover drilling or completion costs or to be economically viable. The use of seismic data and other technologies and the study of producing fields in the same area will not enable us to know conclusively prior to drilling whether oil or natural gas will be present or, if present, whether oil or natural gas will be present in commercial quantities as such studies are merely an interpretive tool.\nDrilling for oil and natural gas involves numerous risks, including the risk that no commercially productive natural gas or oil reservoirs will be discovered. The cost of drilling, completing, and operating wells is substantial and uncertain, and drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed, or canceled as a result of a variety of factors beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nunexpected or adverse drilling conditions;\n\u2022\nelevated pressure or irregularities in geologic formations;\n\u2022\nequipment failures or accidents;\n\u2022\nadverse weather conditions;\n\u2022\ncompliance with governmental requirements; and\n\u2022\nshortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs, crews, and equipment, including as the result shortages of personnel due to epidemics, pandemics or other major public health issues, such as COVID-19.\nAdditionally, the budgeted costs of planning, drilling, completing and operating wells are often exceeded and such costs can increase significantly due to various complications that may arise during the drilling and operating processes. If actual drilling\nand development costs are significantly more than the current estimated costs, we may not be able to continue operations as proposed and could be forced to modify our drilling plans. A productive well may become uneconomical if water or other deleterious substances are encountered which impair or prevent the production of oil and/or natural gas from the well. Unsuccessful drilling activities could result in a significant decline in production and revenues and materially affect our operations and financial condition by reducing available cash and resources.\nFinancial difficulties encountered by our oil and natural gas purchasers, third-party operators or other third parties could decrease cash flow from operations and adversely affect our exploration and development activities.\nWe derive essentially all of our revenues from the sale of our oil, natural gas and NGLs to unaffiliated third-party purchasers, independent marketing companies and midstream companies. Any delays in payments from such purchasers caused by their financial difficulties, including those resulting from the impacts of COVID-19 and its impact on the global economy, will have an immediate negative effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nAdditionally, liquidity and cash flow problems encountered by our working interest co-owners or the third-party operators of our non-operated properties may prevent or delay the drilling of a well or the development of a project. Our working interest co-owners may be unwilling or unable to pay their share of the costs of projects as they become due. In the case of a working interest owner, we could be required to pay the working interest owner\u2019s share of the project costs.\nOur industry is highly competitive, which may adversely affect our operations and performance.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment. In addition to capital, the principle resources necessary for the exploration and production of oil and natural gas include: leasehold prospects under which oil and natural gas reserves may be discovered; drilling rigs and related equipment to explore for such reserves; and knowledgeable personnel to conduct all phases of oil and natural gas operations. We must compete for such resources with both major oil and natural gas companies and independent operators.\nMany of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than ours. The capital, materials and resources needed for our operations may not be available when needed. If we are unable to access capital, material and resources when needed, we may face various consequences, including the breach of our obligations under our oil and natural gas leases and the potential loss of those leasehold interests; damage to our reputation in the oil and natural gas community; inability to retain personnel or attract capital; a slowdown in our operations and decline in revenue; and a decline in the market price of our common stock.\nProperties that we acquire may not produce oil or natural gas as projected, and we may be unable to determine reserves potential, identify liabilities associated with the properties or obtain protection from sellers against them, which could cause us to incur losses.\nOne of our growth strategies has been to pursue selective acquisitions of undeveloped acreage potentially containing oil and natural gas reserves. If we choose, and have the capital resources, to pursue an acquisition, we will perform a review of the target properties. However, these reviews are inherently incomplete as they are based on the quality, availability and interpretation of the reviewed data and the acumen and the assumptions of the evaluation personnel. Generally, it is not feasible to review in depth every individual property, well, facility and/or file involved in an acquisition. Even a detailed review of records and properties may not reveal existing or potential problems, nor will it permit a buyer to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess fully their deficiencies and potential. We may not perform an inspection on every well, and environmental problems, such as groundwater contamination, are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. Even when problems are identified, we may not be able to obtain effective contractual protection against all or part of those problems, and we may assume environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with the acquired properties. If we acquire properties with risks or liabilities that were unknown or not assessed correctly, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected as claims are settled and cleanup costs related to the liabilities are incurred.\nWe may incur losses or costs as a result of title deficiencies in the properties in which we invest.\nPrior to the drilling of an oil and natural gas well, it is customary practice in the oil and natural gas industry for the operator of the well to obtain a preliminary title review of the spacing unit within which the proposed oil and natural gas well is to be drilled to ensure there are no obvious deficiencies in title to the well. Frequently, as a result of such examinations, certain curative work must be done to correct deficiencies in the marketability of the title, and such curative work entails expense. Failure to cure any title defects may adversely impact our ability in the future to increase production and reserves. In the future, we may suffer a monetary loss from title defects or title failure. Additionally, unproved and unevaluated acreage has greater risk of title\ndefects than developed acreage. If there are any title defects or defects in assignment of leasehold rights in properties in which we hold an interest or acquire, we will suffer a financial loss which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur producing properties are all located in the Delaware Basin, making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in one major geographic area.\nAs of December 31, 2019, all of our estimated proved reserves were located in the Delaware Basin in Winkler, Loving, and Reeves Counties, Texas and Lea County, New Mexico. As a result of this concentration, we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of delays or interruptions of production from these wells caused by transportation capacity constraints, curtailment of production, availability of equipment, facilities, personnel or services, governmental regulation, natural disasters, adverse weather conditions, plant closures for scheduled maintenance or interruption of transportation of oil or natural gas produced from the wells in this area.\nIn addition, the effect of fluctuations on supply and demand may become more pronounced within specific geographic oil and natural gas producing areas, which may cause these conditions to occur with greater frequency or magnify the effect of these conditions. Due to the concentrated nature of our portfolio of properties, a number of our properties could experience any of the same conditions at the same time, resulting in a relatively greater impact on our results of operations than they might have on other companies that have a more diversified portfolio of properties. Such delays or interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be the operator on all of our drilling locations, and, therefore, we will not be able to control the timing of exploration or development efforts, associated costs, or the rate of production of any non-operated assets.\nCurrently, we are the operator of approximately 99% of our acreage. As we carry out our exploration and development programs, we may enter into arrangements with respect to existing or future drilling locations that result in wells being operated by others. As a result, we may have limited ability to exercise influence over the operations of the drilling locations operated by our partners. Dependence on the operator could prevent us from realizing target returns for those locations. The success and timing of exploration and development activities operated by our partners will depend on a number of factors that will be largely outside of our control and may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation.\nThe marketability of our production is dependent upon transportation and processing facilities and third parties over which or whom we may have no control.\nThe marketability of our production depends in part upon the availability, proximity and capacity of pipelines, natural gas gathering systems, rail service, and processing facilities in addition to competing oil and natural gas production available to third-party purchasers. We deliver our produced crude oil and natural gas through trucking, gathering systems and pipelines. The lack of availability of capacity on third-party systems and facilities has impacted our ability to sell natural gas and could reduce the price offered for our production or result in the shut-in of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of our development plans.\nAlthough we have contractual control over the transportation of our production through firm transportation arrangements, third-party systems and facilities may be temporarily unavailable due to market conditions, mechanical issues, adverse weather conditions, work-loads, epidemics, pandemics or other major public health issues, such as COVID-19, or other reasons outside of our control. Additionally, if our natural gas contains levels of hydrogen sulfide that require treatment prior to transportation, it could cause delays in the transportation and marketing of our production. Any significant changes affecting these infrastructure systems and facilities, as well as any delays in constructing new infrastructure systems and facilities, could delay our production, which could negatively impact our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.\nThe shut-in of our wells could negatively impact our production, liquidity, and, ultimately, our operations, results, and performance.\nOur production depends, in part, upon our wells that are capable of commercial production not being shut-in (i.e., suspended from production). The lack of availability of capacity on third-party systems and facilities or the shut-in of an oil field\u2019s production could result in the shut-in of our wells. As of December 31, 2019, we had two wells shut-in.\nIn response to recent commodity prices and our efforts to strengthen our capital through reducing operating costs, during April 2020 the Company elected to shut-in 12 wells which were identified as uneconomic as a result of the continued decline in\ncommodity prices in 2020 and 19 additional wells have been identified for short term shut-in through May and June. The 19 wells identified for short term shut-in are naturally flowing wells and could be turned back to sales quickly as market conditions dictate.\nThe producing wells in which we have an interest occasionally experience reduced or terminated production. These curtailments can result from mechanical failures, contract terms, pipeline and processing plant interruptions, market conditions, operator priorities, and weather conditions. These curtailments can last from a few days to many months, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIf we experience low oil production volumes due to the shut-in of our wells or other mechanical failures or interruptions, it would impact our ability to generate cash flows from operations and we could experience a reduction in our available liquidity. A decrease in our liquidity could adversely affect our ability to meet our anticipated working capital, debt service, and other liquidity needs.\nUnless we find new oil and natural gas reserves to replace our actual production, our reserves and production will decline, which would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nProducing oil and natural gas reservoirs generally are characterized by declining production rates and depletion that vary depending upon various factors, including reservoir characteristics and subsurface and surface pressures. Our future oil and natural gas reserves and production and, therefore, our cash flow and revenue are highly dependent on our success in efficiently obtaining additional reserves. We may not be able to develop, find or acquire reserves to replace our current and future production at costs or other terms acceptable to us, or at all, in which case our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.\nAny future plans for exploratory and development drilling are subject to drilling and completion execution risks, and drilling results may not meet our economic expectations for reserves or production.\nUnconventional operations involve utilizing drilling and completion techniques as developed by us and our service providers. Risks that we face while drilling include, but are not limited to, not reaching the desired objective due to drilling problems, not landing our wellbore in the desired drilling zone or specific target, not staying in the desired drilling zone while drilling horizontally through the formation, not running our casing the entire length of the wellbore and not being able to run tools and other equipment consistently through the horizontal wellbore. Risks that we face while completing our wells include, but are not limited to, insufficient mechanical integrity, not being able to hydraulic fracture stimulate the planned number of stages, not being able to run tools the entire length of the wellbore, improper design and engineering for the reservoir parameters, and unsuccessfully cleaning out the wellbore after completion of the final fracture stimulation stage.\nThe success of our drilling and completion techniques can only be developed over time as more wells are drilled and production profiles are established. If our drilling results are less than anticipated or we are unable to execute our drilling program because of capital constraints, lease expirations, access to gathering systems or otherwise, the return on our investment in these areas may not be as attractive as we anticipate and we could incur material write-downs of undeveloped properties and the value of our undeveloped acreage could decline in the future.\nThe unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs, equipment supplies, or personnel could adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans, if and when we are able to resume drilling and completions activity.\nThe oil and natural gas industry is cyclical and, from time to time, there are shortages of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies or qualified personnel. During these periods, the costs of and demand for rigs, equipment and supplies may increase substantially and their availability may be limited. In addition, the demand for, and wage rates of, qualified personnel, including drilling rig crews, may rise as the number of rigs in service increases. If drilling rigs, equipment, supplies or qualified personnel are unavailable to us due to excessive costs or demand or otherwise, our ability to execute our exploration and development plans could be materially and adversely affected and, as a result, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nTerrorist attacks aimed at energy operations could adversely affect our business.\nThe continued threat of terrorism and the impact of military and other government action have led and may lead to further increased volatility in prices for oil and natural gas and could affect these commodity markets or the financial markets used by us. In addition, the U.S. government has issued warnings that energy assets may be a future target of terrorist organizations. These developments have subjected oil and natural gas operations to increased risks. Any future terrorist attack on our facilities, customer facilities, the infrastructure depended upon for transportation of products, and, in some cases, those of other energy companies, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are exposed to operating hazards and uninsured risks.\nOur oil and natural gas exploration and production activities are subject to the operating risks and hazards associated with drilling for and producing oil and natural gas, including fires, explosions and blowouts; negligence of personnel; inclement weather; equipment or pipeline failure; abnormally pressured formations; and environmental pollution. These events may result in substantial losses or costs to us, including losses and costs resulting from injury or loss of life; severe damage to or destruction of property, natural resources or equipment; pollution or environmental damage; clean-up responsibilities; regulatory investigations; penalties and/or suspension of operations; or fees and other expenses incurred in the prosecution or defense of litigation relating to such events.\nIn accordance with customary industry practices, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks. Our insurance may not be adequate to cover all losses or liabilities. We do not carry business interruption insurance, and we cannot fully insure against pollution and environmental risks. We may elect not to carry certain types of insurance if our management believes that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. The occurrence of an event not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The impact of natural disasters or weather events in the areas where we operate has resulted in escalating insurance costs and less favorable coverage terms. Losses and liabilities arising from uninsured or underinsured events may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations, including the loss of our total investment in a particular prospect.\nA failure of technology systems, data breach or cyberattack could materially affect our operations.\nOur information technology systems may be vulnerable to security breaches, including those involving cyberattacks using viruses, worms or other destructive software, process breakdowns, phishing or other malicious activities, or any combination of the foregoing. Such breaches could result in unauthorized access to information, including customer, employee, or other confidential data. We do not carry insurance against these risks, although we do invest in security technology, perform penetration tests, and design our business processes to attempt to mitigate the risk of such breaches. However, there can be no assurance that security breaches will not occur. Moreover, the development and maintenance of these measures requires continuous monitoring as technologies change and security measures evolve. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, cyber security threats and incidents, none of which has been material to us to date. However, a successful breach or attack could have a material negative impact on our operations or business reputation and subject us to consequences such as litigation and direct costs associated with incident response.\nInformation technology solution failures, network disruptions, breaches of data security and cyberattacks could disrupt our operations by causing delays, impeding processing of transactions and reporting financial results, resulting in the unintentional disclosure of customer, employee or our information, or damage to our reputation. A system failure, data security breach or cyberattack could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In the past, we have experienced data security breaches resulting from unauthorized access to our e-mail systems, which to date have not had a material impact on our business; however, there is no assurance that such impacts will not be material in the future.\nWe may not be able to keep pace with technological developments in the industry.\nThe oil and natural gas industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological advancements and introductions of new products and services using new technologies. As others use or develop new technologies, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage or competitive pressures may force us to implement those new technologies at substantial costs. In addition, other oil and natural gas companies may have greater financial, technical, and personnel resources that allow them to enjoy technological advantages and, in the future, may allow them to implement new technologies before we are in a position to do so. We may not be able to respond to these competitive pressures and implement new technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost. If one or more of the technologies used now or in the future were to become obsolete or if we are unable to use the most advanced commercially available technology, the business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe have limited management and staff and may be dependent upon partnering arrangements.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had 43 full-time employees. As a result of layoffs and furloughs in response to COVID-19 and current commodity market conditions, the Company currently has 20 active employees. We leverage the services of independent consultants and contractors to perform various professional services, including engineering, oil and natural gas well planning and supervision, and land, legal, environmental, accounting and tax services. We also pursue alliances with partners in the areas of geological and geophysical services and prospect generation, evaluation and prospect leasing.\nOur dependence on third-party consultants and service providers creates a number of risks, including but not limited to, the possibility that such third parties may not be available to us as and when needed and the possibility that we may not be able to properly control the timing and quality of work conducted with respect to our projects. If we experience significant delays in obtaining the services of such third parties or poor performance by such parties, our results of operations and stock price could be materially adversely affected.\nOur business may suffer with the loss of key personnel or changes to our Board of Directors.\nWe depend to a large extent on the services of certain key management personnel and other executive officers and key employees. These individuals have extensive experience and expertise in evaluating and analyzing producing oil and natural gas properties and drilling prospects, maximizing production from oil and natural gas properties, marketing oil and natural gas production and developing and executing financing and hedging strategies. The loss of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on operations. We do not maintain key-man life insurance with respect to any of our employees. Our success will be dependent on our ability to continue to employ and retain skilled technical personnel.\nWe have an active board of directors that meets several times throughout the year and is intimately involved in the business and the determination of various operational strategies. Members of our board of directors work closely with management to identify potential prospects, acquisitions and areas for further development. If any directors resign or become unable to continue in their present role, it may be difficult to find replacements with the same knowledge and experience and as a result, operations may be adversely affected.\nWe may be subject to risks in connection with acquisitions, and the integration of significant acquisitions may be difficult.\nOur business strategy is based on our ability to acquire additional reserves, oil and natural gas properties, prospects and leaseholds. If and when we are able to do this, significant acquisitions and other strategic transactions may involve risks, including:\n\u2022\ndiversion of our management\u2019s attention to evaluating, negotiating and integrating significant acquisitions and strategic transactions;\n\u2022\nchallenge and cost of integrating acquired operations, information management and other technology systems and business cultures with those of ours while carrying on our ongoing business;\n\u2022\ndifficulty associated with coordinating geographically separate organizations;\n\u2022\nchallenge of attracting and retaining capable personnel associated with acquired operations; and\n\u2022\nfailure to realize the full benefit that we expect in estimated proved reserves, production volume, cost savings from operating synergies or other benefits anticipated from an acquisition, or to realize these benefits within the expected time frame.\nThe process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of our business. Members of our senior management and other staff may be required to devote considerable amounts of time to the integration process, which will decrease the time they will have to manage our business. If our senior management and staff are not able to effectively manage the integration process, or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process, our business could suffer.\nWe may face difficulties in securing and operating under authorizations and permits to drill, complete or operate our wells.\nThe continued growth in oil and natural gas exploration in the United States has drawn intense scrutiny from environmental and community interest groups, regulatory agencies and other governmental entities. As a result, we may face significant opposition to, or increased regulation of, our operations, that may make it difficult or impossible to obtain permits and other needed authorizations to drill, complete or operate, which could result in operational delays or otherwise make oil and natural gas exploration more costly or difficult.\nOur operations are substantially dependent on the availability of water. Restrictions on our ability to obtain water may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWater is an essential component of deep shale oil and natural gas production during both the drilling and hydraulic fracturing processes. Historically, we have been able to purchase water from local land owners for use in our operations. However, Texas has endured severe drought conditions over the past several years. These drought conditions have led governmental authorities to restrict the use of water subject to their jurisdiction for hydraulic fracturing to protect local water supplies. If we are unable to obtain water to use in our operations from local sources, we may be unable to produce oil and natural gas economically, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nLegislative and regulatory initiatives related to global warming and climate change could have an adverse effect on our operations and the demand for oil and natural gas.\nThe EPA has determined that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other \u201cgreenhouse gases,\u201d or \u201cGHGs,\u201d endanger public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to climatic changes. Based on these findings, the EPA, under the Clean Air Act, has adopted and implemented regulations to restrict emissions of greenhouse gases.\nIn addition, the U.S. Congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce GHG emissions and almost one-half of the states have already taken legal measures to reduce GHG emissions, primarily through the planned development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG cap and trade programs. Most of these GHG cap and trade programs work by requiring major sources of emissions, such as electric power plants, or major producers of fuels, such as refineries and natural gas processing plants, to acquire and surrender emission allowances. The number of allowances available for purchase is reduced each year in an effort to achieve the overall GHG emission reduction goal.\nThe adoption of legislation or regulatory programs to reduce GHG emissions could require us to incur increased operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems, to acquire emissions allowances or comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements. Any such legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, the oil, natural gas and NGLs we produce. Consequently, legislation and regulatory programs to reduce GHG emissions could have an adverse effect on our business.\nLegislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and natural gas wells.\nHydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations, and we routinely implement hydraulic fracturing techniques in many of our drilling and completion programs. The process is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions, but the EPA, under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act (\u201cSDWA\u201d), has asserted federal regulatory authority over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving diesel fuel.\nAt the state level, several states have adopted or are considering legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting, disclosure and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. Additionally, local government may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular or prohibit the performance of well drilling in general or hydraulic fracturing in particular. If new or more stringent federal, state, or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we operate, we could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in our exploration, development, or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells.\nIn addition, a number of federal agencies are analyzing, or have been requested to review, environmental issues associated with hydraulic fracturing. These types of studies, depending on their degree of pursuit and any meaningful results obtained, could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA or other regulatory mechanisms.\nCurrent water regulation relating to hydraulic fracturing, particularly water source and groundwater regulation, could result in increased operational costs, operating restrictions and delays.\nHydraulic fracturing can require between three to five million gallons of water per horizontal well. We may face regulatory concerns in both the sourcing and the discharge of water used in hydraulic fracturing.\nIn order to source water from the local water supply for hydraulic fracturing we may need to pay premium rates and be subject to a lower priority if the local area becomes subject to water restrictions. We may also seek water from alternative providers\nsupporting the hydraulic fracturing industry. If we have an insufficient water supply, we will be unable to engage in hydraulic fracturing until such supply is located.\nIn addition, hydraulic fracturing results in water discharges that must be treated and disposed of in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements. Environmental regulations governing the withdrawal, storage and use of surface water or groundwater necessary for hydraulic fracturing may increase operating costs and cause delays, interruptions or termination of operations, the extent of which cannot be predicted, and all of which could have an adverse effect on operations and financial performance. Our ability to remove and dispose of water will affect production, and the cost of water treatment and disposal may affect profitability. The imposition of new environmental initiatives and regulations could also include restrictions on our ability to conduct hydraulic fracturing or disposal of produced water, drilling fluids and other substances associated with the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas.\nWe are subject to numerous federal, state, local and other laws and regulations that can adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of doing business.\nOur operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the exploration, production and sale of oil and natural gas. Future laws or regulations, any adverse change in the interpretation of existing laws and regulations or our failure to comply with existing legal requirements may result in substantial penalties and harm to our business and could affect our results of operations and financial condition. We may be required to make large and unanticipated capital expenditures to comply with applicable laws and governmental regulations, including regulations governing land use restrictions; lease permit restrictions; drilling bonds and other financial responsibility in connection with operations, such as plugging and abandonment bonds; well spacing; unitization and pooling of properties; safety precautions; operational reporting; eminent domain and government takings; and taxation.\nOur operations could be significantly delayed or curtailed and our cost of operations could significantly increase as a result of future changes in federal, state or local laws, regulatory requirements or restrictions.\nWe may incur substantial expenses, and potentially resulting liabilities, to ensure our operations are in compliance with environmental laws and regulations.\nOur oil and natural gas operations are subject to stringent federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including laws and regulations relating to the release and disposal of materials into the environment. These laws and regulations, among other things, require a permit to be obtained before drilling or facility mobilization and commissioning, or injection or disposal commences; limit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas; and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations.\nChanges in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently and any changes that result in more stringent or costly waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or cleanup requirements could require us to make significant expenditures to reach and maintain compliance and may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our industry in general and on our own results of operations, competitive position or financial condition. Under these environmental laws and regulations, we could be held strictly liable for the removal or remediation of previously released materials or property contamination regardless of whether we were responsible for the release or contamination or if our operations met previous standards in the industry at the time they were performed.\nThe Company may be adversely affected by the recent COVID-19 outbreak.\nThe spread of COVID-19 has caused severe disruptions in the worldwide economy, including the global demand for oil and natural gas, which has disrupted our business and operations. Moreover, since the beginning of January 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak has caused significant disruption in the financial markets both globally and in the United States. The continued spread of COVID-19 has resulted in a significant decrease in business and/or cause our oil and natural gas purchasers to be unable to meet existing payment or other obligations to us, particularly in the event of a spread of COVID-19 in our market areas. The continued spread of COVID-19 could also negatively impact the availability of our key personnel necessary to conduct our business. Such a spread could also negatively impact the business and operations of third party service providers who perform critical services for our business. If COVID-19 continues to spread or the response to contain COVID-19 is unsuccessful, we could continue to experience a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nCertain of our assets, including our oil and natural gas interests, may be or become subject to mechanic\u2019s and materialman\u2019s liens if we are unable to pay our oilfield service providers on a timely basis.\nWe enter into contracts with providers of oilfield services as part of our business. Under state laws, liens to secure payment for certain contractors and subcontractors performing certain mineral activities may be attached to certain of our assets, including our oil and natural gas interests. Due to existing economic conditions, we have been unable to, and may in the future continue to be unable to, pay certain of our oilfield service providers on a timely basis. As a result of not making such payments, certain of our assets have become subject to statutory mechanic\u2019s and materialman\u2019s liens, and additional statutory mechanic\u2019s and materialman\u2019s liens may be filed. As of the most recent date available, statutory mechanic's and materialman\u2019s liens which remain unpaid in the amount of $8.7 million have been filed against the related assets.\nRisks Relating to Our Securities\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile, which may depress the market price of our securities and result in substantial losses to investors if they are unable to sell their securities at or above their purchase price.\nThe market price of our securities may fluctuate substantially for the foreseeable future, primarily due to a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nour status as a company with a limited operating history and limited revenues to date, which may make risk-averse investors more inclined to sell their shares on the market more quickly and at greater discounts than would be the case with the shares of a seasoned issuer in the event of negative news or lack of progress;\n\u2022\nannouncements of technological innovations or new products by us or our existing or future competitors;\n\u2022\nthe timing and development of our products;\n\u2022\ngeneral and industry-specific economic conditions;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nliquidity and loan covenants;\n\u2022\nactions by our stockholders;\n\u2022\nchanges in our cash flow from operations or earnings estimates;\n\u2022\nchanges in market valuations of similar companies;\n\u2022\nour capital commitments;\n\u2022\nthe sale or attempted sale or a large amount of common stock into the market;\n\u2022\nthe loss of any of our key management personnel; and\n\u2022\nepidemics, pandemics or other major public health issues, such as COVID-19.\nMany of these factors are beyond our control and may decrease the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance.\nWe may issue shares of our preferred stock with greater rights than our common stock.\nOur articles of incorporation authorize our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock and set the terms of the preferred stock without seeking any further approval from our stockholders. Any preferred stock that is issued may rank ahead of our common stock, in terms of dividends, liquidation rights and voting rights. We currently have four series of preferred stock issued and outstanding, which ranks senior to our common stock with respect to dividends and rights on the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, amongst other preferences and rights.\nThere may be future dilution of our common stock.\nWe have a significant amount of derivative securities outstanding, which upon exercise or conversion, would result in substantial dilution of our common stock. To the extent outstanding restricted stock units, warrants or options to purchase our common stock under our 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan or our 2012 Equity Incentive Plan are exercised, the price vesting triggers under the performance shares granted to our executive officers are satisfied, or additional shares of restricted stock are issued to our employees, holders of our common stock will experience dilution. Furthermore, the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in further dilution to our existing stockholders and cause the price of our outstanding securities to decline.\nWe do not expect to pay dividends on our common stock.\nWe have never paid dividends with respect to our common stock, and we do not expect to pay any dividends, in cash or otherwise, in the foreseeable future. We intend to retain any earnings for use in our business. In addition, our credit facilities and preferred stock prohibit us from paying any dividends. In the future, we may agree to further restrictions. Any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to the appreciation of their stock.\nSecurities analysts may not initiate coverage of our shares or may issue negative reports, which may adversely affect the trading price of the shares.\nSecurities analysts may not provide research reports on our Company. If securities analysts do not cover our Company, the lack of coverage may adversely affect the trading price of our shares. The trading market for our shares will rely in part on the research and reports that securities analysts publish about us and our business. If one or more of the analysts who cover our Company downgrades our shares, the trading price of our shares may decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases to cover our Company, we could lose visibility in the market, which, in turn, could also cause the trading price of our shares to decline. Further, because of our small market capitalization, it may be difficult for us to attract securities analysts to cover our Company, which could significantly and adversely affect the trading price of our shares.\nAnti-takeover effects of certain provisions of Nevada state law hinder a potential takeover of our Company.\nThe existence of certain provisions under Nevada law could delay or prevent a change in control of the Company, which could adversely affect the price of our common stock. Additionally, Nevada law imposes certain restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 10% or more of our outstanding common stock.\nWe are currently not in compliance with the NYSE American listing standards. If our common stock is delisted, the market price and liquidity of our common stock and our ability to raise additional capital would be adversely impacted.\nOur common stock is currently listed on the NYSE American. Continued listing of a security on the NYSE American is conditioned upon compliance with various continued listing standards. On November 21, 2019, we received a deficiency letter (the \u201cFirst Deficiency Letter\u201d) from the NYSE American stating that we were below compliance with the continued listing standards as set forth in Section 1003(a)(i)-(iii) of the NYSE American Company Guide (the \u201cCompany Guide\u201d) because we had reported a stockholders\u2019 equity deficiency as of September 30, 2019 and net losses in our five most recent fiscal years ended December 31, 2018. On December 3, 2019 we received another deficiency letter (the \u201cSecond Deficiency Letter\u201d and, together with the First Deficiency Letter, the \u201cDeficiency Letters\u201d) from the NYSE American stating we were below compliance with the continued listing standards as set forth in Section 1003(f)(v) of the Company Guide because our common stock had been selling for a low price per share for a substantial period of time. The Second Deficiency Letter stated that we must effect a reverse stock split of our common stock or otherwise demonstrate sustained price improvement no later than June 3, 2020.\nThe Deficiency Letters had no immediate effect on our listing on the NYSE American and, therefore, our common stock will continue to be listed on the NYSE American, subject to our compliance with other continued listing requirements of the NYSE American. On December 20, 2019, we submitted a plan of compliance to the NYSE American addressing how we intend to regain compliance with Sections 1003(a)(i)-(iii) of the Company Guide by May 21, 2021. On February 7, 2020, the Company received a letter from the NYSE American stating that our compliance plan has been accepted and that we have been granted a plan period through May 21, 2021.\nBy May 21, 2021, we must either be in compliance or must have made progress that is consistent with the plan during the plan period. In addition, during the plan period, we must provide quarterly updates to the NYSE American concurrent with our interim and annual SEC filings. Failure to meet the requirements to regain compliance could result in the initiation of delisting proceedings.\nThe Deficiency Letters do not affect our business operations or our reporting obligations under the rules and regulations of the SEC, nor do the Deficiency Letters conflict with or cause an event of default under any of the Company\u2019s material agreements.\nIf we cannot meet the NYSE American continued listing requirements by the end of our compliance period, the NYSE American may delist our common stock resulting in our common stock trading in the less liquid over-the-counter market, which could have an adverse impact on us and the liquidity and market price of our stock. The delisting of our stock from the NYSE American could result in even further reductions in our stock price, substantially limit the liquidity of our common stock, and materially adversely affect our ability to raise capital or pursue strategic restructuring, refinancing or other transactions on acceptable\nterms, or at all. Delisting from the NYSE American could also have other negative results, including the potential loss of confidence by vendors and employees, the loss of institutional investor interest and fewer business development opportunities. Our management is considering alternatives to ensure continued compliance with NYSE American listing standards, but there is no assurance that we will continue to maintain compliance with NYSE American continued listing standards.", "PERMNO": 13113, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "LLEXQ"}
