In addition, this report also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The Company\u2019s actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including the risks faced by the Company described below. The occurrence of one or more of the events listed below could also have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, prospects, results of operations, reputation, financial condition, cash flows or ability to continue current operations without any direct or indirect impairment or disruption, which is referred to throughout these Risk Factors as a Material Adverse Effect.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Business and Industry\nIf the Company fails to comply with applicable laws, rules, regulations and guidance, its business could be adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s products and services are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and licensing under various federal, state and local statutes, ordinances, regulations, rules and guidance. These requirements generally mandate licensing or authorization as a pawnbroker, lender or as a CSO, establish limits on the amount, duration, renewals or extensions of and charges for (including interest rates and fees) various categories of loans, direct the form and content of the Company\u2019s loan contracts and other documentation, restrict collection practices, outline underwriting requirements and may subject the Company to periodic examination and ongoing supervision by regulatory authorities, among other things. Because pawn loans and consumer loans, such as those provided by the Company, are viewed as extensions of credit, the Company must comply with certain federal laws, such as the federal Truth-in-Lending Act and its underlying regulations known as Regulation Z, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, the Military Lending Act, the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, the Bank Secrecy Act, the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, Title X of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act with respect to the Company\u2019s CSO programs, among other laws. In addition, the Company\u2019s marketing efforts and the representations made about its products and services are subject to federal and state unfair and deceptive practice statutes, including the FTC Act and analogous state statutes under which the FTC, state attorneys general or private plaintiffs may bring legal actions. Compliance with applicable laws, regulations, rules and guidance requires forms, processes, procedures, training, controls and the infrastructure to support these requirements. Compliance may also create operational constraints, be costly or adversely affect operating results. See \u201cItem 1. Business-Regulation\u201d for a more detailed discussion of the laws applicable to the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s failure to comply with applicable laws, rules, regulations and guidance, or any finding that the Company\u2019s past forms, practices, processes, procedures, controls or infrastructure were insufficient or not in compliance, could subject the Company to regulatory enforcement actions, result in the assessment against it of civil, monetary, criminal or other penalties (some of which could be significant in the case of knowing or reckless violations), result in the issuance of cease and desist orders (which can include orders for restitution or rescission of contracts, as well as other kinds of affirmative relief), require the Company to refund interest or fees, result in a determination that certain loans are not collectible, result in a revocation of licenses or authorization to transact business, result in a finding that it has engaged in unfair and deceptive practices, limit the Company\u2019s access to services provided by third-party financial institutions or cause damage to the Company\u2019s reputation, brands and valued customer relationships. From time to time the Company becomes aware of instances where its products and services have not fully complied with requirements under applicable laws and regulations or applicable contracts. Determinations of compliance with applicable requirements or contracts, such as those applicable to the Company, can be highly technical and subject to varying interpretations. When the Company becomes aware of such an instance, whether as a result of its compliance reviews, regulator inquiry, customer complaint or otherwise, the Company generally conducts a review of the activity in question and determines how to address it, such as modifying the product, making customer refunds or providing additional disclosure. The Company also evaluates\nwhether reports or other notices to regulators are required and provides notice to regulators whenever required. In some cases the Company has decided to take corrective action even after applicable statutory or regulatory cure periods, and in some cases the Company has notified regulators even where such notification may not have been required. Regulators reviewing such incidents may interpret the laws and regulations differently than the Company has, or may choose to take regulatory action against the Company notwithstanding the corrective measures it has taken. This may be the case even if the Company no longer offers the product or service in question.\nIf the Company fails to comply with applicable laws, rules, regulations and guidance, such failure could have a Material Adverse Effect.\nThe CFPB has regulatory, supervisory and enforcement powers over providers of consumer financial products and services, and it could exercise its enforcement powers in ways that could have a Material Adverse Effect.\nThe CFPB has been exercising its supervisory review over and examining certain non-bank providers of consumer financial products and services, including providers of consumer loans such as the Company (and its former e-commerce segment, Enova). The CFPB\u2019s examination authority permits CFPB examiners to inspect the books and records of providers of short-term, small dollar lenders, such as the Company, and ask questions about their business practices, and the examination procedures include specific modules for examining marketing activities, loan application and origination activities, payment processing activities and sustained use by consumers, collections, accounts in default and consumer reporting activities as well as third-party relationships. As a result of these examinations of non-bank providers of consumer credit, the Company could be required to change its practices or procedures, whether as a result of another party being examined or as a result of an examination of the Company, or could be subject to monetary penalties, which could adversely affect the Company. Under certain circumstances, the CFPB may also be able to exercise regulatory authority over providers of pawn loans.\nIn addition to having the authority to obtain monetary penalties for violations of applicable federal consumer financial laws (including the CFPB\u2019s own rules), the CFPB can require remediation of practices, pursue administrative proceedings or litigation and obtain cease and desist orders (which can include orders for restitution or rescission of contracts, as well as other kinds of affirmative relief). Also, where a company has violated Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act or CFPB regulations implemented under Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Dodd-Frank Act empowers state attorneys general and state regulators to bring civil actions to remedy violations of state law. If the CFPB or one or more state attorneys general or state regulators believe that the Company has violated any of the applicable laws or regulations, they could exercise their enforcement powers in ways that could have a Material Adverse Effect.\nThe Company is subject to a Consent Order issued by the CFPB, and any noncompliance could have a Material Adverse Effect.\nOn November 20, 2013, the Company consented to the issuance of a Consent Order by the CFPB pursuant to which it agreed, without admitting or denying any of the facts or conclusions made by the CFPB from its 2012 review of the Company\u2019s consumer loan business, to pay a civil money penalty of $5 million. The Company also agreed to set aside $8 million for a period of 180 days to fund any further payments to eligible Ohio customers in connection with the Ohio Reimbursement Program. The Consent Order also relates to issues self-disclosed to the CFPB during its 2012 examination of the Company, including the making of a limited number of loans to consumers who may have been active duty members of the military at the time of the loan at rates in excess of the interest rate permitted by the federal Military Lending Act, for which the Company has made refunds of approximately $33,500; for certain failures to timely provide and preserve records and information in connection with the CFPB\u2019s examination of the Company; for certain conduct in the examination process; and certain conduct giving rise to the Ohio Reimbursement Program initiated by the Company. In addition, as a result of the CFPB\u2019s review, the Company is in the process of enhancing the Company\u2019s compliance management programs and implementing additional policies and procedures to address the issues identified by the CFPB. The Company is also required to provide periodic reports to the CFPB. The Company is subject to the restrictions and obligations of the Consent Order, including the CFPB\u2019s order that the Company ensure compliance with federal consumer financial laws and develop more robust compliance policies and procedures. These new policies, procedures and other\ninitiatives are in many cases subject to review and potential objection by the CFPB, and the Company cannot predict the timing, substance or effect of any such measures the CFPB may decide to take. Furthermore, the compliance plan mandated by the Consent Order requires the Company to perform a formal consumer protection compliance risk review before introducing or implementing new or changed products or services. This requirement could result in additional delay or cost when introducing or implementing new or changed products or services, or a decision not to proceed with such initiatives. In addition, Enova is also subject to the Consent Order because it was part of the Company when the Consent Order was issued. The Company cannot assure that Enova will continue to comply with the Consent Order now that it is a separate publicly traded company. If Enova does not comply with the consent order, the Company could be held liable for Enova\u2019s noncompliance. See \u201cRisk Factors Related to the Enova Spin-off-In connection with the Enova Spin-off, Enova and the Company have agreed to indemnify each other for certain liabilities; if the Company is required to act on these indemnities to Enova, it may need to divert cash to meet those obligations, and Enova\u2019s indemnity could be insufficient or Enova could be unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations\u201d for information regarding risks related to indemnification by Enova. Any noncompliance with the Consent Order or similar orders or agreements from other regulators could lead to further regulatory penalties and could have a Material Adverse Effect.\nThe adoption of new laws or regulations or adverse changes in, or the interpretation or enforcement of, existing laws or regulations affecting the Company\u2019s products and services could have a Material Adverse Effect.\nGovernments at the national, state and local levels, may seek to impose new laws, regulatory restrictions or licensing requirements that affect the Company\u2019s products or services it offers, the terms on which it may offer them, and the disclosure, compliance and reporting obligations it must fulfill in connection with its business. They may also interpret or enforce existing requirements in new ways that could restrict the Company\u2019s ability to continue its current methods of operation or to expand operations, impose significant additional compliance costs, and could have a Material Adverse Effect. In some cases these measures could even directly prohibit some or all of the Company\u2019s current business activities in certain jurisdictions, or render them unprofitable and/or impractical to continue. For example, the Department of Defense is considering expanding the application of the Military Lending Act, and such expansion could include all types of loans made to consumers, including pawn loans and installment loans offered by the Company that are not currently covered, and such expansion could restrict both the pawn and consumer loans that the Company is able to make by placing a cap on the rates that may be charged to active members of the military and their dependents and this expansion could be costly to the Company to ensure compliance. Additionally, the CFPB has also announced that it has been conducting a review of the short-term small dollar loan industry, which includes a review of payday loans, and has indicated that its \u201cfindings raised substantial consumer protection concerns\u201d related to the sustained use of payday loans. The CFPB recently announced that it is in the late stages of considering the formulation of rules regarding consumer loans, and these rules may impose limitations on payday lending, such as additional underwriting requirements, cooling-off periods between payday loans and limitations on sustained use of payday loans, among other things. If the CFPB adopts any rules or regulations that significantly restrict the conduct of the Company\u2019s consumer loan business, any such rules or regulations could reduce revenue from that product or make the continuance of that product impractical or unprofitable. The Company does not currently know the nature and extent of the rules the CFPB will adopt, but those rules could be proposed and adopted during 2015. The Company closely monitors proposed legislation being discussed in the states where it offers its products and services. Legislative or regulatory actions that affect the products or services offered by the Company at the national, state and local level could have a Material Adverse Effect.\nThe Company is subject to impairment risk, and goodwill impairment charges could have a Material Adverse Effect.\nAt December 31, 2014, the Company had goodwill totaling $487.6 million and intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, of $45.8 million on its consolidated balance sheet. Of this amount of intangible assets, the Company had licenses and trademarks with carrying values of $9.7 million and $5.3 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 that were indefinite-lived intangible assets and not amortized. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in each business combination. Accounting for goodwill and intangible assets requires significant management estimates and judgment. Events may occur in the future, and the Company may not realize the value of its goodwill or intangible assets. The Company tests goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite life for potential impairment annually as of June 30 and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount.\nThe Enova Spin-off in November 2014 was considered a triggering event for purposes of goodwill assessment. Following the Enova Spin-off and as of December 31, 2014, the estimated fair value of the retail services reporting unit was re-calculated to incorporate changes in strategy, observed business trends and outlook. The estimated fair value of the retail services reporting unit declined since the June 30, 2014 annual assessment, but it continued to exceed its underlying carrying value. However, the excess fair value over the carrying value had been reduced to approximately 3% at December 31, 2014. A change in assumptions, such as an increase in the weighted-average cost of capital, could cause the carrying value of the retail services reporting unit to exceed its fair value at December 31, 2014, which could have resulted in an impairment loss. If all assumptions were held constant, a one percentage point increase in the weighted average cost of capital would have decreased the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to approximately $90.6 million below the carrying value, which would have required the Company to perform additional analysis in accordance with ASC 350 to determine if an impairment existed and could have resulted in an impairment loss.\nAs part of the goodwill assessment, the Company also considers market capitalization, which is the observable market value of the Company based on the quoted market prices of the Company's common stock. The Company compares the market capitalization to its carrying value of equity. Following the Enova Spin-off and as of December 31, 2014, the Company\u2019s market capitalization was observed to be lower than the carrying value of equity. The Company believes the observable market value at December 31, 2014 is not a reliable indicator of the Company\u2019s fair value, due to the very short time frame since the date of the Enova Spin-off, a likely transition of a significant number of investors occurring due to the magnitude of the event, and the disruption of the Company\u2019s share price following the event. Management believes this disruption is temporary but acknowledges the need to monitor and re-evaluate any future discrepancies between these values and consider the implications for an impairment of goodwill in future periods.\nThe Company is considered to be at risk for a future impairment of its goodwill in the event of a decline in general economic, market or business conditions or any significant unfavorable changes in the Company's forecasted revenue, expenses, cash flows, weighted-average cost of capital and/or market transaction multiples. The Company will continue to monitor for events and circumstances that could negatively impact the key assumptions in determining the fair value of the retail services reporting unit. Should a review indicate impairment, a write-down of the carrying value of the goodwill or intangible asset would occur, resulting in a non-cash charge, which could have a Material Adverse Effect and could also lead to the Company\u2019s inability to comply with certain covenants in the Company\u2019s financing documents, which could cause a default under those agreements.\nThe Company\u2019s success is dependent, in part, upon its executive officers, and if the Company is not able to attract and retain qualified executive officers or to successfully replace its current Chief Executive Officer who has announced his intention to retire, it could have a Material Adverse Effect.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends, in part, on its executive officers, which is comprised of a relatively small group of individuals. Many members of the senior management team have significant industry experience,\nincluding the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer who has previously announced that he intends to retire from the Company in April 2015. The Company believes that its senior management would be difficult to replace. Because the market for qualified individuals is highly competitive, the Company may not be able to attract and retain qualified executive officers or candidates. For example, attracting or selecting a new Chief Executive Officer who understands the Company\u2019s business and has the experience and skills requisite for such position could be difficult. In addition, increasing regulations and negative publicity on the consumer financial services industry could affect the Company\u2019s ability to attract and retain qualified executive officers, including a new Chief Executive Officer. Additionally, any significant leadership change or executive management transition, such as the replacement of the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, involves inherent risk, and if the Company does not have an effective transfer of knowledge and a smooth transition for this position, it could hinder the Company\u2019s strategic planning, execution and future performance. The Company could also experience other departures of senior management following the replacement of the Chief Executive Officer, and the loss of senior management could result in significant disruptions to the Company\u2019s operations. If the Company is unable to attract or retain qualified executive officers, such inability could have Material Adverse Effect.\nCertain tax positions taken by the Company require the judgment of management and could be challenged by the Internal Revenue Service.\nManagement\u2019s judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes, the deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. Management\u2019s judgment is also required in evaluating whether tax benefits meet the more-likely-than-not threshold for recognition under ASC 740. For example, in connection with the liquidation of Creazione, the Company included a deduction on its 2013 federal income tax return for the Company\u2019s tax basis in the stock of Creazione and recognized a tax benefit of approximately $33.2 million as a result of the deduction. Management believes that the Company met the requirements for this deduction and that it should be treated as an ordinary loss, which reduced the Company\u2019s cash taxes paid in 2013. The Company obtained a private letter ruling from the IRS with respect to one of the various factors that the Company considered in making this determination. Because there are a number of factors that must be considered in making this determination, some of which were not specifically addressed in the private letter ruling, the IRS could challenge the availability and/or characterization of the loss. If the deduction is ultimately denied or is determined to be a capital loss by the IRS, the Company may be required to reverse the previously recognized tax benefit and may be required to make additional income tax payments, which could have a Material Adverse Effect. In addition, the Enova Spin-off was structured with the intent that it would be a tax-free distribution. See \u201cRisk Factors Related to the Enova Spin-off-The Company could be responsible for U.S. federal and state income tax liabilities that relate to the Enova Spin-off\u201d for additional information regarding risks related to the tax treatment of the Enova Spin-off.\nDecreased demand for the Company\u2019s products and specialty financial services, due to sustained changes in the economy or for other reasons, and the Company\u2019s failure to adapt to such decrease could result in a loss of revenue and could have a Material Adverse Effect.\nThe demand for a particular product or service may decrease due to a variety of factors, such as regulatory restrictions that reduce customer access to particular products, the availability of competing or alternative products, changes in macro-economic conditions or changes in customers\u2019 financial conditions. Should the Company fail to adapt to a significant change in its customers\u2019 demand for, or access to, its products, the Company\u2019s revenue could decrease significantly. Even if the Company makes adaptations or introduces new products to fulfill customer demand, customers may resist or may reject products whose adaptations make them less attractive or less available. In any event, the effect of any product change on the results of the Company\u2019s business may not be fully ascertainable until the change has been in effect for some time. In particular, the Company has changed, and will continue to change, some of the consumer loan operations of the Company and the products it offers. In addition, a sustained deterioration in the economy could also decrease demand for pre-owned merchandise such as the merchandise sold in the Company\u2019s pawnshops and cause deterioration in the performance of the Company\u2019s pawn loan or consumer loan portfolios. While the credit risk for much of the Company\u2019s pawn lending is mitigated by the collateralized nature of pawn lending, a sustained deterioration in the economy could reduce the demand for and\nresale value of pre-owned merchandise and reduce the amount that the Company could effectively lend on an item of collateral. Such reductions could adversely affect pawn loan balances, pawn loan redemption rates, inventory balances, inventory mixes and gross profit margins. An economic slowdown could also result in a decreased number of consumer loans being made to customers due to higher unemployment or an increase in loan defaults in the Company\u2019s consumer loan products. A sustained strengthening in the economy could also reduce demand for the Company\u2019s pawn and consumer loans. As the Company\u2019s customer base has more available disposable income, the demand for pawn loans and consumer loans could decrease. For example, gas prices have recently significantly decreased, and the Company believes that such decreases cause its customers to have more available disposable income. A sustained decrease in gas prices could result in a sustained decrease in demand for the Company\u2019s pawn and consumer loans. Any of these events could result in a loss of revenue and could have a Material Adverse Effect.\nA significant portion of the Company\u2019s pawn loans are secured by gold collateral, and a significant and sustained decline in gold prices could result in decreases in the value of collateral securing outstanding pawn loans, in the balance of pawn loans secured by gold jewelry, in inventory valuations, and in commercial merchandise sales.\nA significant portion, or 62.9% as of December 31, 2014, of the Company\u2019s pawn loans are secured by gold jewelry, and the Company also sells forfeited gold jewelry through either retail or commercial sales. The Company\u2019s pawn service charges, sales proceeds and ability to dispose of jewelry inventory through retail or commercial sales at an acceptable margin depend on the value of gold. In recent years, there has been an increased volatility in the price of gold, and gold prices have declined meaningfully since 2012. This decrease significantly reduced the proceeds and gross profit from the disposition of gold through commercial sales, and, as a result, during 2013 and 2014, the Company shifted its strategy to place a greater emphasis on retail disposition of merchandise and now relies less on the disposition of commercial merchandise due to the prevailing lower market price for gold. An additional significant and sustained decline in gold prices could result in decreases in the value of collateral securing outstanding pawn loans, in the balance of pawn loans secured by gold jewelry, in inventory valuations, and in commercial merchandise sales and could have a Material Adverse Effect.\nNegative public perception of the Company\u2019s business and its business practices could cause demand for the Company\u2019s products to significantly decrease.\nIn recent years, consumer advocacy groups and some media reports have advocated governmental action to prohibit or place severe restrictions on consumer loans. The fees and/or interest charged by the Company for consumer loans and others in the industry attract media publicity about the industry and can be perceived as controversial because the focus is typically on the Annual Percentage Rate charged to a consumer for these types of loans, which is compared unfavorably to the interest typically charged by banks to consumers with top-tier credit histories. If the negative characterization of the types of loans that the Company offers becomes increasingly accepted by consumers, demand for any or all of the Company\u2019s loan products could significantly decrease, which could have a Material Adverse Effect. Additionally, if the negative characterization of these types of loans is accepted by legislators and regulators, even if such negative perceptions are inaccurate, attributable to conduct by third parties not affiliated with the Company (such as other industry members), or attributable to matters not specific to the industry, the Company could become subject to more restrictive laws and regulations applicable to the consumer loan products offered by the Company that could impair the Company\u2019s ability to offer consumer loans.\nIn addition, the Company\u2019s ability to attract and retain customers is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of its business, including its level of service, trustworthiness, business practices, financial condition and other subjective qualities. Negative perceptions or publicity regarding these or other similar matters-even if related to seemingly isolated incidents or to practices not specific to pawn loans or consumer loans, such as debt collection-could erode trust and confidence and damage the Company\u2019s reputation among existing and potential customers, which could make it difficult for the Company to attract new customers and retain existing customers and could significantly decrease the demand for the Company\u2019s product, any of which could have a Material Adverse Effect.\nSome of the Company\u2019s debt agreements contain financial covenants and other restrictions that may limit the Company\u2019s ability to operate its business, and failure to satisfy the Company\u2019s debt obligations could have a Material Adverse Effect.\nAs of December 31, 2014, the Company had $196.5 million total debt outstanding, as more fully described under \u201cItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 11.\u201d Some of the Company\u2019s debt agreements contain various restrictive covenants, compliance with which is essential to continued credit availability. If the Company is unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain funds necessary to make required payments on these debt obligations or if it is in breach of the covenants contained in the debt agreements it would default under the terms of the applicable agreement or indenture. These restrictive covenants, among other things, restrict the Company\u2019s ability to:\n\u2022\nincur additional debt;\n\u2022\nincur or permit certain liens to exist;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments;\n\u2022\nmerge or consolidate with or into, or convey, transfer, lease or dispose of all or substantially all of its assets to, another company;\n\u2022\nmake certain dispositions;\n\u2022\nmake certain payments; and\n\u2022\nengage in certain transactions.\nSome of the Company\u2019s debt agreements also require the Company to maintain certain financial ratios and have cross default provisions. The covenants and restrictions contained in the debt agreements could limit the Company\u2019s ability to fund its business, make capital expenditures, and make acquisitions or other investments in the future. Any failure to comply with any of these financial and other affirmative and negative covenants could constitute an event of default under the debt agreements, entitling the lenders to, among other things, terminate future credit availability under the agreement, increase the interest rate on outstanding debt, accelerate the maturity of outstanding obligations under that agreement and could result in a cross default under the Company\u2019s other debt agreements. For example, representatives of a small number of holders of the 2018 Senior Notes, which the Company believes own less than a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the 2018 Senior Notes, have indicated that they believe the Enova Spin-off was not permitted by the 2018 Senior Notes Indenture. These noteholders have taken the position that the Company is in default under the Indenture and that a make-whole premium is payable, in addition to principal and accrued interest. The Company disagrees with the assertion that a default exists under the 2018 Senior Notes Indenture and also disagrees that a make-whole premium would be due in the event of a default because, among other things, the 2018 Senior Notes Indenture provides that upon acceleration of the 2018 Senior Notes due to a default, the repayment remedy is the repayment of principal and accrued interest with no provision for a make-whole premium. The Company believes the position taken by these noteholders is without merit and the Company intends to vigorously defend its position on these issues if formally asserted. This claim could be costly to defend, could be damaging to the Company\u2019s reputation, could be time consuming for management and could affect the Company\u2019s ability to obtain capital in the future. As of the date of this Annual Report, the Company has ample liquidity and capital resources, including availability under the Company\u2019s Domestic and Multi-Currency Line of Credit, to repay the 2018 Senior Notes regardless of the outcome of this claim.\nAn inability to access the debt capital markets or obtain financing could reduce available capital.\nIn the past, the Company has accessed the debt capital markets or utilized its line of credit with banks to obtain capital, to finance growth and to refinance existing debt obligations. Efficient access to this capital is critical to the Company\u2019s ongoing financial success; however, the Company\u2019s future access to debt capital could become restricted due to a variety of factors, such as a deterioration of the Company\u2019s earnings, cash flows, balance sheet quality, overall business or industry prospects, or reputation in the debt markets, a disruption or deterioration in the state of the capital markets or a negative bias toward the Company\u2019s industry. Banks and other credit providers could restrict available lines of credit and require higher pricing upon renewal of the Company\u2019s existing line of\ncredit. The Company\u2019s ability to obtain additional financing in the future will depend in part upon prevailing capital market conditions, and a potential disruption in the capital markets may adversely affect the Company\u2019s efforts to arrange additional financing on terms that are satisfactory to the Company. If adequate funds are not available, or are not available on acceptable terms, the Company may not be able to grow its business, make future investments, take advantage of potential acquisitions or other opportunities, make share repurchases or respond to competitive challenges and this, in turn, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to advance its strategic plans. Additionally, if the capital and credit markets experience volatility and the availability of funds is limited, third parties with whom the Company does business may incur increased costs or business disruption and this could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business relationships with such third parties. If the Company is unable to obtain financing such inability could have a Material Adverse Effect.\nCurrent and future litigation or regulatory proceedings or adverse court interpretations of the laws under which the Company operates could have a Material Adverse Effect.\nThe Company has been and is currently subject to lawsuits, which may include purported class actions that could cause the Company to incur substantial expenditures, generate adverse publicity and could significantly impair the Company\u2019s business, force the Company to cease doing business in one or more jurisdictions or cause it to cease offering one or more products. The Company is also likely to be subject to further litigation in the future. An adverse ruling in or a settlement of any current or future litigation against the Company or another lender could cause the Company to have to refund fees and/or interest collected, forego collections of the principal amount of loans, pay treble or other multiple damages, pay monetary penalties and/or modify or terminate the Company\u2019s operations in particular jurisdictions. Defense of any lawsuit, even if successful, could require substantial time and attention of the Company\u2019s management and could require the expenditure of significant amounts for legal fees and other related costs. The Company is also subject to regulatory proceedings, and the Company could suffer losses from interpretations of applicable laws, rules and regulations in those regulatory proceedings, even if the Company is not a party to those proceedings. In addition, adverse court interpretations of the various laws and regulations under which the Company operates could require the Company to alter the products that it offers or cease doing business in the jurisdiction where the court interpretation is applicable. Any of these events could have a Material Adverse Effect.\nIncreased competition from companies offering similar financial products and services offered by the Company could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe Company has many competitors. Its principal lending competitors are other pawnshops, consumer loan companies, banks or other financial institutions, CSOs, online lenders and consumer finance companies that serve the Company\u2019s primary customer base. The Company\u2019s principal competitors to its retail operations, include retailers of new merchandise, retailers of pre-owned merchandise, other pawn shops, thrift shops, internet retailers, internet auction sites and other similar sites. Increased competition or aggressive marketing and pricing practices by these competitors could result in decreased revenue, margins and turnover rates in the Company\u2019s retail operations. Competitors of the Company\u2019s business may also operate, or begin to operate, under business models less focused on legal and regulatory compliance, which could put the Company at a competitive disadvantage. Many other financial institutions or other businesses that do not now offer products or services directed toward the Company\u2019s traditional customer base, many of whom may be much larger than the Company, could begin doing so. Significant increases in the number and size of competitors for the Company\u2019s business could result in a decrease in the number of loans that the Company writes, resulting in lower levels of revenue and earnings. The Company may not be able to compete successfully against any or all of its current or future competitors. As a result, the Company could lose market share and its revenue could decline, thereby affecting the Company\u2019s ability to generate sufficient cash flow to service its indebtedness and fund the Company\u2019s operations. Any such changes in the Company\u2019s competition could have a Material Adverse Effect.\nConsumer loans have come under increased regulatory scrutiny that has resulted in increasingly restrictive regulations and legislation and may in the future result in additional regulations and legislation that makes offering such loans in certain states where the Company operates less profitable or unattractive to the Company.\nIn recent years, consumer loans, which are also commonly referred to as \u201cpayday loans\u201d and includes certain of the Company\u2019s consumer loan products and comprised 8.9% of the Company\u2019s total revenue as of December 31, 2014, have come under increased regulatory scrutiny that has resulted in increasingly restrictive regulations and legislation that makes offering such loans in certain states where the Company operates less profitable or unattractive to the Company. For example, during 2013, the Company closed 36 retail services locations in Texas in connection with the Texas Consumer Loan Store Closures, mainly as a result of restrictive city ordinances that have been passed since 2011 that had the effect of reducing the profitability and the volume of short-term consumer loans. The Company closely monitors proposed legislation being discussed in the states where it offers consumer loans and is currently monitoring proposed legislation in Texas, Missouri and Tennessee. Additional legislative or regulatory initiatives that are similar to or broader those that have already been adopted could be enacted that could severely restrict, prohibit or eliminate the Company\u2019s ability to offer its consumer loan product. Any of these or other legislative or regulatory actions that affect the Company\u2019s consumer loan business at the national, state and local level could, if enacted or interpreted differently, could have a Material Adverse Effect. See \u201cThe adoption of new laws or regulations or adverse changes in, or the interpretation or enforcement of, existing laws or regulations affecting the Company\u2019s products and services could have a Material Adverse Effect\u201d for additional information regarding potential rules or regulations that could affect the Company\u2019s consumer loan business.\nJudicial decisions, CFPB rule-making or amendments to the Federal Arbitration Act could render the arbitration agreements the Company uses illegal or unenforceable.\nThe Company includes arbitration provisions in its consumer loan agreements. These provisions are designed to allow the Company to resolve any customer disputes through individual arbitration rather than in court and explicitly provide that all arbitrations will be conducted on an individual and not on a class basis. Thus, the Company\u2019s arbitration agreements, if enforced, have the effect of shielding the Company from class action liability. The Company\u2019s arbitration agreements do not generally have any impact on regulatory enforcement proceedings. The Company takes the position that the arbitration provisions in its consumer loan agreements, including class action waivers, are valid and enforceable; however, the enforceability of arbitration provisions is often challenged in court. If those challenges are successful, the Company\u2019s arbitration and class action waiver provisions could be unenforceable, which could subject the Company to additional litigation, including additional class action litigation. In addition, the U.S. Congress has considered legislation that would generally limit or prohibit mandatory arbitration agreements in consumer contracts and has enacted legislation with such a prohibition with respect to certain mortgage loan agreements and also certain consumer loan agreements to members of the military on active duty and their dependents. Further, the Dodd-Frank Act directs the CFPB to study consumer arbitration and report to the U.S. Congress, and it authorizes the CFPB to adopt rules limiting or prohibiting consumer arbitration, consistent with the results of its study. In 2013, the CFPB released a preliminary report on consumer arbitration provisions and indicated further study was in process. The results of the CFPB\u2019s further study on arbitration were released in a report to Congress in March 2015. The report, which the CFPB states is an empirical study and not an evaluative study, sets forth the CFPB\u2019s factual findings from its comprehensive empirical review of the facts surrounding the resolution of consumer disputes - both in arbitration and in the courts. Any rule adopted by the CFPB would apply to arbitration agreements entered into more than six months after the final rule becomes effective (and not to prior arbitration agreements). Any judicial decisions, legislation or other rules or regulations that impair the Company\u2019s ability to enter into and enforce consumer arbitration agreements and class action waivers could significantly increase the Company\u2019s exposure to class action litigation as well as litigation in plaintiff-friendly jurisdictions, which would be costly and could have a Material Adverse Effect.\nThe Company\u2019s business depends on the uninterrupted operation of the Company\u2019s systems and business functions.\nThe Company\u2019s storefront operations depend on the efficiency and reliability of the Company\u2019s point-of-sale system. A shut-down of or inability to access the facilities in which the Company\u2019s storefront point-of-sale system and other technology infrastructure are based, such as a power outage, a failure of one or more of its information technology, telecommunications or other systems, or sustained or repeated disruptions of such systems could significantly impair the Company\u2019s ability to perform such functions on a timely basis and could result in a deterioration of the Company\u2019s ability to perform efficient storefront lending and merchandise disposition activities, provide customer service, perform collections activities, or perform other necessary business functions. Any such interruption could have a Material Adverse Effect.\nThe Company\u2019s services, operations and storefronts from which it provides products and services are also vulnerable to damage or interruption from tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, fires, floods, power losses, telecommunications failures, terrorist attacks, acts of war, human errors and similar events. A significant natural disaster, such as a tornado, which the Company\u2019s headquarters has experienced in the past, hurricane, earthquake, fire or flood, could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s ability to conduct business, including causing damage to merchandise or collateral that it holds in any of its retail services locations and causing multiple pawn lending locations to shut down or have limited operations, and the Company\u2019s insurance coverage may be insufficient to compensate for losses that may occur. Acts of terrorism, civil unrest or violence could cause disruptions to the Company\u2019s business or the economy as a whole. Any of these events could cause consumer confidence to decrease, which could result in a decreased number of loans being made to customers or reduced demand for pre-owned merchandise such as the merchandise sold in the Company\u2019s pawnshops. Any of these occurrences could have a Material Adverse Effect.\nThe Company is subject to cyber security risks and security breaches and may incur increasing costs in an effort to minimize those risks and to respond to cyber incidents.\nThe Company\u2019s business involves the storage and transmission of customers\u2019 proprietary information, and security breaches could expose the Company to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, litigation, and potential liability. The Company\u2019s network is entirely dependent on the secure operation of its systems as well as the operation of the internet generally. While the Company has incurred no material cyber attacks to date, a number of other companies have disclosed cyber attacks and security breaches, some of which have involved intentional attacks. The Company may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent rapidly evolving types of cyber attacks. Attacks may be targeted at the Company, its customers, or both. If an actual or perceived breach of security occurs, customer and/or supplier perception of the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s security measures could be harmed and could result in the loss of customers, suppliers or both. Actual or anticipated attacks and risks may cause the Company to incur increasing costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees, and engage third party experts and consultants.\nA person who is able to circumvent the Company\u2019s security measures could misappropriate the Company\u2019s or its customers\u2019 proprietary information, cause interruption in the Company\u2019s operations, damage its computers or those of its customers, or otherwise damage its reputation and business. Any compromise of security could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, significant legal and financial exposure, damage to the Company\u2019s reputation, and a loss of confidence in the Company\u2019s security measures, which could harm its business. In addition, most of the Company\u2019s customers provide personal information, including bank account information when applying for consumer loans. The Company relies on secure transmissions protocols and access control technology licensed from third parties to provide the security and authentication to effectively secure transmission of confidential information, including customer bank account and other personal information. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments may result in the technology used by the Company to protect transaction data being breached or compromised. Data breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues.\nThe Company\u2019s servers are also vulnerable to computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, and similar disruptions, including \u201cdenial-of-service\u201d type attacks. The Company may need to expend significant resources to address problems caused by breaches. Security breaches, including any breach of the Company or of persons with whom it has commercial relationships that result in the unauthorized release of its customers\u2019 personal information, could damage the Company\u2019s reputation and expose it to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability. In addition, many of the third parties who provide products, services or support to the Company could also experience any of the above cyber risks or security breaches, which could impact the Company\u2019s customers and the Company\u2019s business and could result in a loss of customers, suppliers or revenue.\nAny of these events could result in a loss of revenue and could have a Material Adverse Effect.\nThe failure of third parties who provide products, services or support to the Company to maintain their products, services or support could disrupt Company operations or result in a loss of revenue.\nThe Company\u2019s consumer loan revenue depends in part on the willingness and ability of unaffiliated third-party lenders, through the CSO programs, to make loans to customers and other third parties to provide services to facilitate lending, loan underwriting and payment processing. The loss of the relationship with any of these third parties, and an inability to replace them or the failure of these third parties to maintain quality and consistency in their programs or services or to have the ability to provide their products and services, could cause the Company to lose customers and substantially decrease the revenue and earnings of its consumer loan business. The Company\u2019s revenue and earnings from its consumer loan business could also be adversely affected if any of those third-party providers make material changes to products or services that the Company relies on. The Company offers other services provided by various third parties to its customers. If a third-party provider fails to provide its products or services, makes material changes to such products and services or does not maintain its quality and consistency or fails to have the ability to provide its products and services, the Company could lose customers and related revenue from those products or services. The Company also uses third parties to support and maintain certain of its communication systems and computerized point-of-sale and information systems. The failure of such third parties to fulfill their support and maintenance obligations could disrupt the Company\u2019s operations. Any of these events could result in a loss of revenue and could have a Material Adverse Effect.\nThe Company\u2019s reported results require the judgment of management, and the Company could be subject to risks associated with these judgments or could be adversely affected by the implementation of new, or the interpretation of existing, accounting principles or financial reporting requirements.\nThe preparation of the Company\u2019s financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the dates of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. In addition, the Company prepares its financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and GAAP and its interpretations are subject to change over time. The Company may also encounter conflicting rules or guidance under GAAP, which could affect its accounting for certain matters or its ability to timely file reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission. For example, on March 2, 2014, the Company filed a Form 12b-25 Notice of Late Filing with the SEC for its Annual Report because the Company's audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014 were not finalized. The delay in completing the financial statements was attributable to the Company\u2019s accounting treatment for the derecognition of goodwill in connection with the Enova Spin-off. The Company may encounter conflicting guidance in the future. If new rules or interpretations of existing rules require the Company to change its financial reporting or cause a delay in the Company\u2019s filings with the SEC, it could have a Material Adverse Effect, and the Company could be required to restate historical financial reporting.\nFuture acquisitions and/or the failure to successfully integrate newly acquired businesses into the Company\u2019s operations could negatively impact the Company\u2019s performance.\nThe Company has historically grown through strategic acquisitions, and the Company may pursue attractive acquisition opportunities in the future in order to expand its product and service offerings and markets and grow its business in response to changing customer demands, regulatory environments, technologies and competitive pressures. In some circumstances, the Company may expand its offerings through the acquisition of complementary businesses, solutions or technologies rather than through internal development. The identification of suitable acquisition candidates can be difficult, time-consuming and costly, and the Company may not be able to successfully complete identified acquisitions. Furthermore, even if the Company successfully completes an acquisition, it may not be able to successfully assimilate and integrate the business, technologies, solutions, personnel or operations of the business that it acquires, particularly if key personnel of an acquired company decide not to work for the Company. In addition, the Company may issue equity securities to complete an acquisition, which would dilute its shareholders\u2019 ownership and could adversely affect the price of the Company\u2019s common stock. Acquisitions may also involve the entry into geographic or business markets in which the Company has little or no prior experience or may expose the Company to additional material liabilities. In addition, any acquisition has the risk that the Company may not realize a return on the acquisition or the Company\u2019s investment. Consequently, the Company may not achieve anticipated benefits of the acquisitions, which could have a Material Adverse Effect.\nPotential expansion for the Company is subject to external factors and other circumstances over which the Company has limited control or that are beyond the Company\u2019s control. These factors and circumstances could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to grow through the opening and acquisition of new operating units.\nThe Company may try to expand its business by acquiring existing stores and opening new ones, as it has done in the past. The success of this strategy is subject to numerous external factors, such as the availability of attractive acquisition candidates, the availability of sites with acceptable restrictions and suitable terms, the Company\u2019s ability to attract, train and retain qualified store management personnel, the ability to access capital, the ability to obtain required government permits and licenses, the prevailing laws and regulatory environment of each state or jurisdiction in which the Company operates or seeks to operate, which are subject to change at any time, the degree of competition in new markets and its effect on the Company\u2019s ability to attract new customers and the ability to adapt the Company\u2019s infrastructure and systems to accommodate its growth. Some of these factors are beyond the Company\u2019s control. The failure to execute this expansion strategy would adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to expand its business and could have a Material Adverse Effect.\nThe Company may incur property, casualty or other losses not covered by insurance.\nThe Company maintains a program of insurance coverage for various types of property, casualty and other risks. The types and amounts of insurance that it obtains vary from time to time, depending on availability, cost and management\u2019s decisions with respect to risk retention. The policies are subject to deductibles and exclusions that result in the Company\u2019s retention of a level of risk on a self-insurance basis. Losses not covered by insurance could be substantial and may increase the Company\u2019s expenses, which could harm the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nAdverse real estate market fluctuations could affect the Company\u2019s profitability.\nThe Company leases most of its locations. A significant rise in real estate prices or real property taxes could result in an increase in store lease costs as the Company opens new locations and renews leases for existing locations.\nOther risk factors are discussed under \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.\u201d\nRisks Related to the Enova Spin-off\nThe Company could be responsible for U.S. federal and state income tax liabilities that relate to the Enova Spin-off.\nThe Enova Spin-off was conditioned on the receipt of an opinion of tax counsel that the Enova Spin-off will be treated as a transaction that is tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Section 355(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. An opinion of tax counsel is not binding on the IRS. Accordingly, the IRS may reach conclusions with respect to the Enova Spin-off that are different from the conclusions reached in the opinion. The opinion was based on certain factual statements and representations made by the Company, which, if incomplete or untrue in any material respect, could alter tax counsel\u2019s conclusions. If the IRS were to determine the Enova Spin-off to be taxable, the Company would recognize a substantial tax liability.\nThe Company has received a private letter ruling from the IRS to the effect that the retention by the Company of up to 20% of Enova\u2019s stock will not be in pursuant to a plan having as one of its principal purposes the avoidance of U.S. federal income tax within the meaning of Section 355(a)(1)(D)(ii) of the Internal Revenue Code. The private letter ruling does not address any other tax issues related to the Enova Spin-off. Notwithstanding the private letter ruling, the IRS could determine on audit that the retention of the Enova stock was in pursuant to a plan having as one of its principal purposes the avoidance of U.S. federal income tax if it determines that any of the facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings that the Company or Enova have made or provided to the IRS are not correct. If the retention is in pursuant to a plan having as one of its principal purposes the avoidance of U.S. federal income tax, then the distribution could ultimately be determined to be taxable, and the Company would recognize gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of shares of Enova\u2019s common stock distributed to the Company\u2019s shareholders on the distribution date over the Company\u2019s tax basis in such shares of Enova\u2019s common stock. In addition, the Company agreed to certain actions in connection with the private letter ruling, such as disposing of the Enova stock that it retained within two years following the Enova Spin-off, and if the Company does not or is unable to follow-through with such actions, the tax-free status of the Enova Spin-off could be jeopardized.\nIn connection with the Enova Spin-off, Enova and the Company have agreed to indemnify each other for certain liabilities; if the Company is required to act on these indemnities to Enova, it may need to divert cash to meet those obligations, and Enova\u2019s indemnity could be insufficient or Enova could be unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations.\nPursuant to a Separation and Distribution Agreement and certain other agreements that the Company entered into with Enova at the time of the Enova Spin-off, including the Tax Matters Agreement, Enova has agreed to indemnify the Company for certain liabilities that could be related to tax, regulatory, litigation or other liabilities, and the Company has agreed to indemnify Enova for certain similar liabilities, in each case for uncapped amounts. In addition, the Tax Matters Agreement prohibits Enova from taking any action or failing to take any action that could reasonably be expected to cause the Enova Spin-off to be taxable or to jeopardize the conclusions of the private letter ruling obtained in connection with the Enova Spin-off or opinions of counsel received by the Company or Enova. Indemnities that the Company may be required to provide Enova are not subject to any cap, may be significant and could negatively impact the Company\u2019s business, particularly indemnities relating to the Company\u2019s actions that could impact the tax-free nature of the distribution. Third parties could also seek to hold the Company responsible for any of the liabilities that Enova has agreed to assume. Further, the indemnity from Enova could be insufficient to protect the Company against the full amount of such liabilities, or Enova may be unable to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. Moreover, even if the Company ultimately succeeds in recovering from Enova any amounts for which it is held liable, the Company may be temporarily required to bear these losses and could suffer reputational risks if the losses are related to regulatory, litigation or other matters. Each of these risks could have a Material Adverse Effect.\nThe Company is unable to take certain actions because such actions could jeopardize the tax-free status of the Enova Spin-off, and the Company may forego certain transactions in order to avoid the risk of incurring significant tax-related liabilities.\nPursuant to the Tax Matters Agreement that the Company entered into with Enova in connection with the Enova Spin-off, the Company is prohibited from taking actions that could reasonably be expected to jeopardize the conclusions of the private letter ruling obtained in connection with the Enova Spin-off or the opinion of counsel received by the Company. In addition, if the Company takes any action that causes the Enova Spin-off to be taxable, then the Company would be fully liable for any resulting taxes and expenses and Enova would only be required to indemnify the Company under the Tax Matters Agreement to the extent Enova\u2019s actions were responsible for the Company incurring such taxes and expenses.\nThe Enova Spin-off would result in a significant U.S. federal income tax liability to the Company under Section 355(e) of the Internal Revenue Code if the Enova Spin-off is treated as part of a plan or series of related transactions for one or more persons to acquire a fifty percent (50%) or greater interest (measured by vote or value) in the stock of the Company. Current law generally creates a presumption that any acquisitions of the stock of the Company within two years before or after the Enova Spin-off are part of a plan that includes the Enova Spin-off, although the Company may be able to rebut that presumption. As a consequence, for the two years following the Enova Spin-off, the Company will be limited in its ability to take certain actions to the extent that taking such actions could reasonably be expected to cause the Enova Spin-off to be treated as part of a plan for one or more persons to acquire a fifty percent (50%) or greater interest in the stock of the Company. Open market purchases of Company common stock by third parties without any negotiation with the Company will generally not cause the Enova Spin-off to be treated as part of such a plan. However, actions within the two year period that could be presumed to be part of such a plan include:\n\u2022\nthe acquisition of fifty percent (50%) or more of the Company\u2019s common stock by one or more persons within the two year period following the Enova Spin-off;\n\u2022\nentering into any agreement, understanding or arrangement by the Company with respect to transactions or events (including, without limitation, stock issuances, pursuant to the exercise of stock options or otherwise, option grants, capital contributions or an acquisition, or a series of such transactions or events) that cause the Enova Spin-off to be treated as part of a plan pursuant to which one or more persons acquire directly or indirectly stock of the Company representing more than a fifty percent (50%) interest in the equity of the Company;\n\u2022\nany actions that breach a representation made by the Company to the IRS in connection with obtaining the private letter ruling obtained by the Company in connection with the Enova Spin-off or by the Company to its counsel in connection with the issuance of a tax opinion by such counsel with respect to the Enova Spin-off.\nBecause of the significant liability to the Company that would result from the Enova Spin-off being treated as a taxable transaction, the Company may be limited in the amount of capital stock that it can issue to make acquisitions or to raise additional capital for the two years following the Enova Spin-off. In addition, the potential liability to the Company may discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring control of the Company during this two year period pursuant to a transaction that the Company\u2019s shareholders might otherwise consider favorable.\nThe Company is subject to continuing contingent liabilities of Enova.\nEven though the Company and Enova are now separate, publicly-traded companies, there are several significant areas where the liabilities of Enova may become the Company\u2019s obligations. For example, under the Internal Revenue Code and the related rules and regulations, each corporation that was a member of the Company\u2019s consolidated U.S. federal income tax reporting group during any taxable period or portion of any taxable period ending on or before the effective time of the distribution is jointly and severally liable for the U.S. federal income tax liability of the entire consolidated tax reporting group for the Company for that taxable period. In connection\nwith the Enova Spin-off, the Company has entered into a Tax Matters Agreement with Enova that allocates the responsibility for prior period taxes of the Company\u2019s consolidated tax reporting group between the Company and Enova; however, if Enova is unable to pay any prior period taxes for which it is responsible, the Company could be required to pay the entire amount of such taxes.\nThe Company could be exposed to potential liabilities arising out of state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws and legal distribution requirements in connection with the Enova Spin-off.\nThe Enova Spin-off could be challenged under various state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws. An unpaid creditor or an entity vested with the power of such creditor (such as a trustee or debtor-in-possession in a bankruptcy) could claim that the Enova Spin-off left the Company insolvent or with unreasonably small capital or that the Company intended or believed it would incur debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature and that the Company did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value in the Enova Spin-off and distribution. If a court were to agree with such a plaintiff, then such court could void the distribution as a fraudulent transfer and could impose a number of different remedies, including without limitation, returning Enova\u2019s assets or Enova\u2019s shares that are distributed to the Company.\nThe measure of insolvency for purposes of the fraudulent conveyance laws will vary depending on which jurisdiction\u2019s law is applied. Generally, however, an entity would be considered insolvent if either the fair saleable value of its assets is less than the amount of its liabilities (including the probable amount of contingent liabilities), or it is unlikely to be able to pay its liabilities as they become due. The Company does not know what standard a court would apply to determine insolvency. Further, a court could determine that the Company was insolvent at the time of or after giving effect to the Enova Spin-off.\nUnder the Separation and Distribution Agreement that the Company entered into with Enova in connection with the Enova Spin-off, the Company is responsible for and has retained the debts, liabilities and other obligations related to the business or businesses which the Company owns and operates following the Enova Spin-off and Enova is responsible for and has assumed the debts, liabilities and other obligations related to the business or businesses that Enova owns and operates following the Enova Spin-off. Although the Company does not expect to be liable for any obligations not expressly retained by it pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement, it is possible that the Company could be required to assume responsibility for certain obligations assumed by Enova under the Separation and Distribution Agreement should Enova fail to pay or perform its assumed obligations.\nCertain members of management, directors and shareholders may face actual or potential conflicts of interest.\nAs a result of the Enova Spin-off, the Company\u2019s management and directors and the management and directors of Enova may own both the Company\u2019s common stock and Enova\u2019s common stock. This ownership overlap could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest when the Company\u2019s management and directors and Enova\u2019s management and directors face decisions that could have different implications for the Company and Enova. For example, potential conflicts of interest could arise in connection with the resolution of any dispute between the Company and Enova regarding the terms of the agreements governing the Enova Spin-off and the Company\u2019s relationship with Enova thereafter or in the strategy for defending or resolving any litigation in which both the Company and Enova are involved. These agreements include the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the Tax Matters Agreement, the Stockholder\u2019s and Registration Rights Agreement, the Transition Services Agreement, the Software Lease and Maintenance Agreement and any commercial agreements between the parties or their affiliates. Potential conflicts of interest may also arise because the Company\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer, Daniel R. Feehan, also serves as a director of Enova. Further, conflicts of interest may arise out of any commercial arrangements that the Company and Enova may enter into in the future.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Common Stock\nThe price of the Company\u2019s common stock has been volatile and could continue to fluctuate substantially.\nThe Company\u2019s common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange. The market price of the Company\u2019s common stock has been volatile and could fluctuate substantially based on a variety of factors, including the following:\n\u2022\nvariations in results of operations;\n\u2022\nlegislative or regulatory changes, and in particular, legislative or regulatory changes affecting the Company\u2019s operations;\n\u2022\nthe Enova Spin-off;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in commodity prices;\n\u2022\ngeneral trends in the industry;\n\u2022\nmarket conditions;\n\u2022\nanalysts\u2019 estimates; and\n\u2022\nperceptions of and other events related to the pawn or consumer loan industry.\nThe market price for the Company\u2019s common stock has varied between a high of $25.45 on November 13, 2014 and a low of $15.79 on January 24, 2014 in the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2014, which prices are adjusted to reflect the Company\u2019s stock price as if the Enova Spin-off had occurred on January 1, 2014. The Company\u2019s stock price is likely to continue to be volatile and subject to significant price and volume fluctuations in response to market and other factors, including the other factors discussed in \u201cRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Business and Industry\u201d and \u201cRisks Related to the Enova Spin-off,\u201d variations in the Company\u2019s quarterly operating results from management\u2019s expectations or those of securities analysts or investors, downward revisions in securities analysts\u2019 estimates and announcements by the Company or its competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments.\nIn addition, the stock market in general may experience significant volatility that is unrelated to the operating performance of companies whose shares are traded. These market fluctuations could adversely affect the trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock, regardless of the Company\u2019s actual operating performance.\nFuture issuances of additional shares of the Company\u2019s common stock could cause dilution of ownership interests and adversely affect the Company\u2019s stock price.\nThe Company may, in the future, issue its previously authorized and unissued shares of common stock, which would result in the dilution of the ownership interests of the Company\u2019s shareholders. The Company is currently authorized to issue up to 80,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.10 per share, and as of February 17, 2015, the Company had 28,567,276 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. The potential issuance of additional shares of common stock may create downward pressure on the trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock. The Company may also issue additional shares of its common stock or other securities that are convertible into or exercisable for common stock for capital-raising or other business purposes. Future sales of substantial amounts of common stock, or the perception that sales could occur, could have a Material Adverse Effect on the price of the Company\u2019s common stock.", "PERMNO": 75215, "SIC": 5900, "TIC": "CSH"}
