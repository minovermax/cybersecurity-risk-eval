RISK FACTORS.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS, STRATEGY AND INDUSTRY\nWe had a net loss for our 2022 fiscal year, expect to incur net losses in the future, and may not be able return to or sustain profitability.\nWe incurred a net loss of $27.3 million in our fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 and expect to continue to have net losses in the future. We expect to continue to incur significant sales and marketing, research and development, regulatory and other expenses as we expand our commercialization efforts to increase adoption of our products, expand existing relationships with our customers, obtain regulatory clearances or approvals for our planned or future products, conduct clinical trials on our existing and planned or future products, and develop new products or add new features to our existing products. We expect to continue to incur losses in the future, which may fluctuate significantly from period to period. If our revenue declines or fails to grow at a rate faster than increases in our operating expenses, we will not be able to return to and maintain profitability in future periods. We cannot ensure that we will return to profitability or that, if we do become profitable, we will be able to sustain profitability.\nThe loss of, or significant reduction in business from, one or more of our major customers could significantly reduce our revenue, earnings or other operating results.\nA significant portion of our revenue is derived from a relatively small number of customers. Two of our customers each provided more than 10% of our revenue in fiscal 2022. Revenue from Medtronic and Abbott represented approximately 13% and 11%, respectively, of our total revenue for fiscal 2022 and was generated from multiple products and fields of use. The loss of Medtronic, Abbott, or any of our other large customers, or reductions in business from them, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow. There can be no assurance that revenue from any customer will continue at their historical levels. If we cannot broaden our customer base, we will continue to depend on a small number of customers for a significant portion of our revenue.\nThe long-term success of our business may suffer if we are unable to maintain and expand our licensing base, including with customers who may perceive our vascular intervention products as competing with their products.\nWe intend to continue pursuing a strategy of licensing our performance coating technologies that impart lubricity, pro-healing and biocompatibility characteristics, as well as drug-delivery capabilities (together, \u201cperformance coatings\u201d or \u201cperformance coating technologies\u201d) to a diverse array of medical device companies, thereby expanding the commercialization opportunities for our technologies. A significant portion of our revenue is derived from customer devices used in connection with procedures in cardiovascular, peripheral vascular, neurovascular, structural heart and other applications. As a result, our business is susceptible to adverse trends in procedures. We may also be subject to adverse trends in specific markets such as the cardiovascular industry, including declines in procedures using our customers\u2019 products as well as declines in average selling prices from which we earn royalties. Further, some of our performance coating technology customers may consider the vascular intervention products that we sell directly to healthcare providers to be competitive with their products.\nOur success will depend, in part, on our ability to retain existing performance coatings technology customers and to attract new licensees, to enter into agreements for additional applications with existing licensees, and to develop technologies for use in new applications. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify, develop and adapt our technologies for new applications in a timely and cost-effective manner; that new license agreements will be executed on terms favorable to us; that new applications will be accepted by customers in our target markets; or that products incorporating newly licensed technology, including new applications, will gain regulatory approval, be commercialized or gain market acceptance. Delays or failures in these efforts could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, we cannot be sure that existing or potential customers will not avoid using our performance coating technologies because they perceive our vascular intervention products to be a competitive threat, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur success depends on our ability to effectively develop and market our products against those of our competitors.\nWe operate in highly competitive and quickly evolving fields, and new developments are expected to continue at a rapid pace. Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to maintain competitive positions in the development of technologies and products in the fields of surface modification, device drug delivery, medical device products and diagnostics. Our performance coating technologies compete with technologies developed by a number of other companies. In addition, many medical device manufacturers have developed, are engaged in efforts to develop, or through common ownership are or may become affiliates of companies that have developed, performance coating technologies for use on their own or affiliates\u2019 products, particularly in the area of drug delivery. With respect to commercialization of our vascular intervention medical device products, we have faced, and expect to continue to face, competitive pressures, including pricing pressure, from larger OEM suppliers, as well as larger medical device companies that produce similar products. Some of our existing and potential competitors (especially medical device manufacturers pursuing coating solutions through their own R&D efforts) have greater financial and technical resources, as well as production and marketing capabilities, than us. Further, even if we are successful in our plans to develop new medical device products, the commercialization of\nthese products may be dependent upon a commercial partner to effectively market and sell our products to end users. Competitors may succeed in developing competing technologies or obtaining governmental approval for products before us. Products incorporating our competitors\u2019 technologies may gain market acceptance more rapidly than products using our technologies. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that new products or technologies developed by others, or the emergence of new industry standards, will not render our products or technologies or licensees\u2019 products incorporating our technologies uncompetitive or obsolete. Any new technologies that make our performance coatings, medical device platforms or In Vitro Diagnostics technologies less competitive or obsolete would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Competition in the diagnostics market is highly fragmented, and in the product lines in which we compete, we face an array of competitors ranging from large manufacturers with multiple business lines to small manufacturers that offer a limited selection of products. Some of our competitors have substantially more capital resources, marketing experience, R&D resources and production facilities than we do.\nWe may not be successful in implementing our vascular intervention product development and commercialization strategy.\nSince fiscal 2013, we have been focused on a key growth strategy to develop and commercialize vascular intervention products. Our aim is to provide customers with highly differentiated products that address unmet clinical needs. To date, we have commercialized our vascular intervention products through collaborations with other medical device companies and through our own direct sales channel in the United States. We may seek to expand the commercialization of these products through existing customers, third-party distributors, or other distribution channels.\nSuccessfully implementing our vascular intervention product strategy places substantial demands on our resources and requires, among other things:\n\u2022maintenance and enhancement of our medical device R&D capabilities, including those needed to support the clinical evaluation and regulatory approval for our vascular intervention products;\n\u2022effective coordination and integration of our research facilities and teams, particularly those located in our product development facility in Minnesota and our Irish operations;\n\u2022successful hiring, training, and retention of personnel;\n\u2022effective management of a business geographically located both in the U.S. and Ireland;\n\u2022effective commercialization of our products, including through strategic partnerships with our medical device customers, third-party distributors, and direct sales;\n\u2022commitment from our medical device customers to market our products effectively or to devote resources necessary to provide effective sales;\n\u2022sufficient liquidity to support substantial investments in working capital, R&D, and selling, general and administrative (\u201cSG&A\u201d) resources required to make our strategy successful; and\n\u2022increased sales, marketing, field clinical support, and sales-related activities.\nThere is no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement our vascular intervention product strategy, which could negatively impact our ability to realize an acceptable return on the investments we are making in connection with this strategy and may result in an adverse impact on our business and financial results.\nWe anticipate that increased operating expenses related to the development and direct-sale commercialization of medical device products will have an adverse impact on our near-term operating results and financial position, and they may not be effective.\nIn fiscal 2022, we established a field sales team to sell our radial access and thrombectomy medical device products directly to healthcare providers in the United States. Our SG&A expenses increased by 53% in fiscal 2022, over the prior year, primarily due to personnel and other investments in our direct sales initiatives. We currently expect SG&A expense to increase further in fiscal 2023 reflecting the full-year impact of direct-sales and support personnel who were hired throughout fiscal 2022. In addition, our R&D expense increased by 8% in fiscal 2022, over the prior year, partially due to increases in staffing levels and expenses related to our medical device products.\nBecause we expect the increased operating expenses related to direct sales of our medical device products to exceed any related increases in revenues in fiscal 2023, we anticipate that the increased expenses will adversely impact our operating results and cash flow during the year, which is likely to have an adverse effect on our financial position. Accordingly, we may seek additional sources of funds, including additional borrowing against our credit facility, to fund our continued investment in the development and direct sale of our medical device products. Such funds may not be available on favorable terms, if at all.\nIn addition to the operating expenses associated with product development and direct-sale commercialization activities, such activities are subject to risks of failure that are inherent in the development and commercialization of new medical technologies or products\nand establishment of a new sales force. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in developing new technologies or products, or in commercializing any such technologies or products through direct sales, or otherwise. Even if we are successful in developing and commercializing new technologies or products, there can be no assurance that gross profits from their sales will exceed our operating expenses related to their development and commercialization.\nOur credit agreement contains covenants that restrict our business and financing activities. All of our assets secure our obligations under the credit agreement and may be subject to foreclosure.\nOn October 14, 2022, we entered into a secured revolving credit facility and secured term loan facilities pursuant to a Credit, Security and Guaranty Agreement (the \u201cMidCap Credit Agreement\u201d) with Mid Cap Funding IV Trust, as agent, and MidCap Financial Trust, as term loan servicer and the lenders from time to time party thereto (together \u201cMidCap\u201d). The MidCap Credit Agreement provides for availability under a secured revolving line of credit of up to $25 million, which may be drawn upon until maturity, subject to a borrowing base, and up to $100 million ($25 million of which is at the sole discretion of MidCap) in term loans, which may be drawn upon in increments of at least $10 million until December 31, 2024. The line of credit and term loans mature on October 1, 2027. We borrowed $30 million upon the closing of the credit facility, consisting of $5 million drawn on the line of credit and $25 million of term loans.\nThe MidCap Credit Agreement contains covenants that limit our ability to engage in certain transactions. Subject to limited exceptions, these covenants limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022create, incur, assume or permit to exist any additional indebtedness, or create, incur, allow or permit to exist any additional liens;\n\u2022enter into any amendment or other modification of certain agreements;\n\u2022effect certain changes in our business, fiscal year, management, entity name or business locations;\n\u2022liquidate or dissolve, merge with or into, or consolidate with, any other company;\n\u2022pay cash dividends on, make any other distributions in respect of, or redeem, retire or repurchase, any shares of our capital stock;\n\u2022make certain investments, other than limited permitted acquisitions; and\n\u2022enter into transactions with our affiliates.\nThese provisions impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to compete effectively, take advantage of new business opportunities, or take other actions that may be in our, or our shareholders\u2019, best interests.\nIn addition to the other covenants under the MidCap Credit Agreement, we must maintain minimum core net revenue levels tested quarterly if term loans exceed $25.0 million.\nThe MidCap Credit Agreement contains customary indemnification obligations and customary events of default, including, among other things:\nOur obligations under the MidCap Credit Agreement are secured by all our existing and future acquired assets, including intellectual property and real estate.\nOur inability to comply with any of the provisions of the MidCap Credit Agreement could result in a default under it. If such a default occurs, the lenders may elect to declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable, and it would have the right to terminate any commitments to provide further funds. If we are unable to repay outstanding borrowings when due, the lender also has the right under the MidCap Credit Agreement to proceed against the collateral granted to it to secure the indebtedness under the MidCap Credit Agreement. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nWe expect our interest expense to increase, and we may draw on our term loan availability to preserve our access to capital, both of which may adversely impact our financial results.\nIn our fiscal 2022, we incurred approximately $0.6 million of interest expense on our outstanding debt of $10 million with our prior lender, based on a weighted average annual interest rate on the debt of 3.96% for the year. As of October 14, 2022, we borrowed $5\nmillion on our revolving credit line with MidCap at an annual interest rate equal to 3.00% plus the greater of Term SOFR (as defined in the MidCap Credit Agreement) or 1.50%, which represented an annual interest rate of 6.04% as of such date. We also borrowed $25 million of term loans with MidCap as of October 14, 2022. We entered into a five-year interest rate swap transaction on October 14, 2022 with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. that fixed the annual interest rate on the $25 million of term loans at 10.205%. The combination of greater outstanding debt and higher interest rates will cause our interest expense to increase in our fiscal 2023 and beyond, which will adversely impact our cash flow and financial results.\nUnder the MidCap Credit Agreement, we may borrow up to an additional $75 million ($25 million of which is at the sole discretion of MidCap) in term loans, which may be drawn upon in increments of at least $10 million prior to December 31, 2024. Since we cannot draw upon the term loans between December 31, 2024 and when they mature on October 1, 2027, we may, in order to preserve our access to this source of capital, elect to draw upon the term loans prior to when we would need the proceeds to fund our operations. Such borrowing may cause our interest expense to increase further and adversely impact our financial results and cash flow after such borrowing.\nWe may seek to prepay our borrowings under the MidCap Credit Agreement before its maturity, which would subject us to early termination fees and may lead us to raise capital on unfavorable terms.\nSubject to certain limitations, the term loans under our MidCap Credit Agreement have a prepayment fee for payments made prior to the maturity date equal to 3.0% of the prepaid principal amount for the first year following the closing date of the MidCap Credit Agreement, 2.0% of the prepaid principal amount for the second year following the closing date, and 1.0% of the prepaid principal amount for the third year following the closing date and thereafter. In addition, if the revolving credit facility under the MidCap Credit Agreement is terminated in whole or in part prior to the maturity date, we must pay a prepayment fee equal to 3.0% of the terminated commitment amount for the first year following the closing date of the MidCap Credit Agreement, 2.0% of the terminated commitment amount for the second year following the closing date and 1.0% of the terminated commitment amount for the third year following the closing date and thereafter. We also are required to pay a full exit fee at the time of maturity or full prepayment equal to 2.5% of the aggregate principal amount of the term loans made pursuant to the MidCap Credit Agreement and a partial exit fee at the time of any partial prepayment event equal to 2.5% of the amount prepaid.\nTo obtain more favorable interest rates or credit terms, or for other financial or strategic reasons, we may seek to prepay our borrowings under the MidCap Credit Agreement. To do so, we may seek to raise additional capital through equity offerings or debt financings and such additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Further, any additional equity or debt financing transaction may contain terms that are not favorable to us or our shareholders. For example, if we raise funds by issuing equity or equity-linked securities, the issuance of such securities could result in dilution to our shareholders. Any equity securities issued also may provide for rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. Further, the issuance of additional equity securities by us, or the possibility of such issuance, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nIn addition, the terms of debt securities issued or borrowings could impose significant restrictions on our operations including restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to, among other things, dispose of assets, effect certain mergers, incur debt, grant liens, pay dividends and distributions on capital stock, make investments and acquisitions, and enter into transactions with affiliates, and other operating restrictions that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business.\nIf we enter into asset transactions, collaborations or licensing arrangements to raise capital, we may be required to accept unfavorable terms, such as the relinquishment or licensing of certain technologies or products that we otherwise might seek to develop or commercialize ourselves, or reserve for future potential arrangements when we might otherwise be able to achieve more favorable terms.\nFailure to successfully commercialize the Pounce\u2122 venous thrombectomy product obtained in the acquisition of Vetex Medical Limited may limit our growth and adversely impact our operating results, balance sheet, cash flows and liquidity.\nOn July 2, 2021, we completed the acquisition of all outstanding shares of Vetex Medical Limited (\u201cVetex\u201d). Vetex holds a Food and Drug Administration 510(k) clearance, E.U. CE Mark, and portfolio of patents related to the Pounce venous mechanical thrombectomy catheter product (the \u201cPounce Venous Thrombectomy Catheter\u201d). However, Vetex had not initiated commercial production or established commercialization of the product prior to the acquisition. We acquired Vetex with an upfront cash payment of $39.9 million and are obligated to pay additional installments totaling $3.5 million in fiscal 2024 through fiscal 2027. An additional $3.5 million in payments are contingent upon the achievement of certain product development and regulatory milestones within a contingency period ending in fiscal 2027. As of the acquisition date, we recognized $28 million in intangible assets, $3 million in deferred tax liabilities and $19 million in goodwill related to the acquisition.\nWe began limited market evaluations of the Pounce Venous Thrombectomy Catheter in June of 2022. For us to realize the anticipated benefits of the Vetex acquisition, we must successfully establish commercial manufacturing for the Pounce Venous Thrombectomy Catheter, and successfully develop and execute a commercialization strategy for the product. If we are unsuccessful, or encounter delays or cost overruns, in establishing commercial manufacturing for the Pounce Venous Thrombectomy Catheter, or if potential customers do not adopt the Pounce Venous Thrombectomy Catheter at sufficient levels to make it a commercial success, our operating\nresults, cash flows and liquidity may be adversely impacted. Further, the goodwill and intangible assets that we recognized related to the acquisition may become impaired if the financial performance of the Pounce Venous Thrombectomy Catheter does not meet our expectations, which could negatively affect our balance sheet.\nConcerns over a study that reported a mortality signal associated with paclitaxel-coated products may adversely affect market acceptance of our paclitaxel-coated DCB products and our potential revenues from them.\nOn March 15, 2019, the FDA issued a communication (the \u201cFDA communication\u201d) to healthcare providers about the potential for increased long-term mortality after use of paclitaxel-coated balloons and paclitaxel-eluting stents (collectively \u201cpaclitaxel-coated products\u201d) to treat PAD in the femoropopliteal artery. The FDA communication updated a previous notification from the FDA on the same topic, which was in response to meta-analysis of randomized trials published in the Journal of the American Heart Association in December 2018. Subsequently, in August 2019, the FDA issued an update on the use of paclitaxel devices to treat PAD that recommended that physicians discuss the risks and benefits of all available treatment options with their patients. The FDA communication and the potential long-term mortality signal related to the use of paclitaxel-coated devices may adversely affect market acceptance of our paclitaxel-coated DCB products and the revenue we may realize from the commercialization of the SurVeil DCB if the FDA grants premarket approval (\u201cPMA\u201d) for the product.\nFailure to effectively utilize our limited ability to make acquisitions, to accurately financially model the impact of acquisitions, or to integrate acquired businesses or technologies into our operations successfully may limit our growth and adversely impact operating results, cash flows and liquidity.\nThe MidCap Credit Agreement defines acquisitions broadly and limits our ability to pay for acquisitions to (i) an aggregate of $10 million in cash consideration over the five-year term of the MidCap Credit Agreement, and (ii) consideration consisting of noncash equity interests. Acquisitions of complementary businesses or technologies can be important potential catalysts for our revenue growth. Our limited ability to make cash acquisitions may prevent us from making acquisitions that would enhance our business and revenues. It also may cause us to use equity interests as consideration for larger acquisitions, which would dilute the equity interest of our existing shareholders.\nOur identification of suitable acquisition candidates involves risks inherent in assessing the technology, value, strengths, weaknesses, overall risks and profitability, if any, of acquisition candidates. We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates, or we may be unable to execute acquisitions due to competition from buyers with more resources.\nOur ability to realize the anticipated benefits of a potential acquisition depends, in part, on the accuracy of our financial model of the timing and magnitude of cash flows, expenses and revenues related to the acquired business. If the expectations reflected in our financial models for acquisitions are not realized, our operating results, cash flows and liquidity may be materially adversely affected.\nThe process of integrating acquired businesses into our operations could pose numerous and significant risks. In addition, future acquisitions may cause large one-time expenses or create goodwill or other intangible assets that could result in future significant asset impairment charges. In addition, if we acquire entities that have not yet commercialized products, but rather are developing technologies for future commercialization, our earnings per share may fluctuate as we expend significant funds for continued R&D efforts necessary to commercialize such acquired technology.\nOur failure to expand our management systems and controls to support anticipated growth or integrate acquisitions could seriously harm our operating results and business.\nOur operations are expanding, and we expect this trend to continue as we execute our business strategy. Executing our business strategy has placed significant demands on management and our administrative, development, operational, information technology, manufacturing, financial and personnel resources. Accordingly, our future operating results will depend on the ability of our officers and other key employees to continue to implement and improve our operational, development, customer support and financial control systems, and effectively expand, train and manage our employee base. Otherwise, we may not be able to manage our growth successfully.\nGoodwill or other assets on our balance sheet may become impaired or require valuation reserves, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nAs of September 30, 2022, we had $68.9 million of goodwill and intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet. As required by the accounting guidance, we evaluate at least annually the potential impairment of our goodwill. Testing for impairment of goodwill involves the determination of the fair value of our reporting units. The estimation of fair values involves a high degree of judgment and subjectivity in the assumptions used. We also evaluate other assets on our balance sheet, including definite-lived intangible assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. Our estimate of the fair value of the assets may be based on fair value appraisals or discounted cash flow models using various inputs. Future impairment charges could materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn the fourth quarter of our fiscal 2022, we recognized $10.2 million of non-cash income tax expense related to the establishment of a full valuation reserve against our U.S. deferred tax assets. While we do not have any unreserved U.S. deferred tax assets remaining on our balance sheet, we do have significant amounts of goodwill and other intangible assets on our balance sheet, which could be subject to future impairment charges.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had adverse effects on our business and results of operations, and it or other global health concerns could seriously harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nEarly in the COVID-19 pandemic, U.S. healthcare providers limited non-emergent elective medical procedures other than high acuity treatments in order to conserve personal protective equipment and limit exposure to COVID-19. The reduction in elective medical procedures resulted in reductions in the use of certain medical devices, which in turn reduced the licensing revenue that we recognized from impacted devices that incorporate our technologies. Throughout the pandemic, we incurred additional operating expenses to facilitate our employees working from home when possible, provide personal protective equipment, enhance cleaning and sanitation procedures, and modify workspaces to reduce the potential for disease transmission. We also suspended operations for limited periods in limited production work areas when employees were identified as having COVID-19.\nWe cannot predict the duration or scope of the COVID-19 pandemic or whether or when other global health concerns may emerge. In response to COVID-19 resurgences or other global health concerns, we, governments, businesses, and healthcare providers may take actions that could have material adverse effects on our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, and capital investments.\nOur business could be adversely affected by global economic conditions.\nProlonged economic uncertainties or downturns could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Negative conditions in the general economy in either the United States or abroad, including conditions resulting from financial and credit market fluctuations, increased inflation and interest rates, changes in economic policy, trade uncertainty, including changes in tariffs, sanctions, international treaties, and other trade restrictions, the occurrence of a natural disaster or global public health crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, or armed conflicts, such as between Russia and Ukraine, impact corporate spending in general and negatively affect the growth of our business.\nThese conditions could make it difficult for us and our customers to forecast and plan future business activities accurately and could cause our customers to reevaluate or delay their decisions to license our technologies, purchase our products or enter into R&D arrangements with us. A substantial downturn affecting our customers may cause them to react to worsening conditions by reducing their capital expenditures in general or by specifically reducing their spending on medical devices and technologies. We cannot predict the timing, strength, or duration of any economic slowdown, downturn, instability, or recovery, generally or within any particular industry or geography. Any downturn of the general economy or industries in which we operate would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe recognize revenue in accordance with complex accounting standards, and changes in circumstances or interpretations may lead to accounting adjustments. Failure to implement these standards properly might impact the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting or impact the reliability of our financial reporting.\nOur revenue recognition policies involve application of complex accounting standards, including the determination of when control is transferred to the customer and the allocation of the transaction price to multiple performance obligations. Our compliance with such accounting standards often involves management\u2019s judgment regarding whether the criteria set forth in the standards have been met such that we can recognize as revenue the amounts that we expect to receive as payment for our products or services. We base our judgments on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. However, these judgments, or the assumptions underlying them, may change over time. In addition, the SEC or the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) may issue new positions or revised guidance on the treatment of complex accounting matters. Changes in circumstances or third-party guidance could cause our judgments to change with respect to our interpretations of these complex standards, and transactions recorded, including revenue recognized, for one or more prior reporting periods, could be adversely affected. In addition, failure to implement these standards properly could impact the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting or impact the reliability of our financial reporting, which could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock.\nOur business includes foreign operations, which exposes us to certain risks related to fluctuations in U.S. dollar and foreign currency exchange rates.\nWe report our consolidated financial statements in U.S. dollars. In a period where the U.S. dollar is strengthening or weakening relative to the Euro, our revenue and expenses denominated in the Euro are translated into U.S. dollars at a lower or higher value than they would be in an otherwise constant currency exchange rate environment. As our foreign operations expand, the effects may become material to our consolidated financial statements.\nChanges in product mix and increased manufacturing costs could cause our product gross margin percentage to fluctuate or decline in the future.\nChanges in our product mix and increases in manufacturing costs could cause our gross profit percentage to fluctuate or decline in the future. These factors, together with the scale-up of our manufacturing operations, particularly in Ireland, adversely affected our gross margin percentage for the last fiscal year and these factors will likely continue to affect our gross profit percentage in fiscal 2023 and beyond.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR OPERATIONS AND RELIANCE ON THIRD PARTIES\nWe rely on third parties to market, distribute and sell most products incorporating our coating and device technologies, as well as certain of our vascular intervention products.\nA principal element of our business strategy is to enter into licensing arrangements with medical device and other companies that manufacture products incorporating our technologies. We derived 36%, 45%, and 43% of our revenue from royalties and license fees (including related to our SurVeil DCB) under such licensing arrangements in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The revenue that we derive from such arrangements depends upon our ability, or our licensees\u2019 ability, to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for, manufacture (if applicable), market, and sell products incorporating our technologies. Many of these factors are outside of our control. Our failure, or the failure of our licensees, to meet these requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, a licensee could modify their product in such a way that it no longer incorporates our technology. Moreover, under our standard license agreements, licensees can terminate the license for any reason upon 90 days\u2019 prior written notice. Existing and potential licensees have no obligation to deal exclusively with us and may pursue parallel development or licensing of competing technologies on their own or with third parties. A decision by a licensee to terminate its relationship with us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn fiscal 2018, we entered into an agreement with Abbott whereby Abbott will have exclusive worldwide commercialization rights for the SurVeil DCB. Upon receipt of U.S. regulatory approval for the SurVeil DCB, Abbott has the right to purchase commercial units from us and we will realize revenue from product sales to Abbott at an agreed-upon transfer price, as well as a share of net profits resulting from third-party product sales by Abbott. Upon receipt of U.S. regulatory approval, we will rely on Abbott to effectively market and sell the SurVeil DCB. If Abbott is unable or unwilling to effectively market and sell the SurVeil DCB, it could have a have material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have not produced our SurVeil DCB on a commercial scale. If the FDA grants PMA for the product, we may encounter challenges in scaling up our production of it, which could have an adverse impact on our operating results.\nIf the FDA grants PMA of our SurVeil DCB, we expect Abbott to launch commercialization of the product in the U.S. We will be responsible for manufacturing commercial quantities of the product. The SurVeil DCB is a highly complicated drug/device combination product that we have never manufactured on a commercial scale. It is not uncommon for there to be low yields, inefficiencies, or production issues when the manufacturing processes for a complicated product are ramped up to commercial scale. Any production issues related to our SurVeil DCB could have material adverse effects on our revenues and operating results.\nA portion of our IVD business relies on distribution agreements and relationships with various third parties, and any adverse change in those relationships could result in a loss of revenue and harm that business.\nWe sell many of our IVD products outside of the U.S. through distributors. Some of our distributors also sell our competitors\u2019 products. If they favor our competitors\u2019 products for any reason, they may fail to market our products as effectively or to devote resources necessary to provide significant sales, which would cause our results to suffer. Additionally, we serve as the exclusive distributor in the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico for DIARECT GmbH (Part of BBI Solutions) for its recombinant and native antigens. The success of these arrangements with these third parties depends, in part, on the continued adherence to the terms of our agreements with them. Any disruption in these arrangements will adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on our customers to accurately report and make payments under our license agreements with them.\nWe rely on our performance coatings technology customers to determine whether the products that they sell are royalty-bearing and, if so, to report and pay the amount of royalties owed to us under our agreements with them. The majority of our performance coatings technology license agreements with our customers give us the right to audit their records to verify the accuracy of their reports to us. However, these audits can be expensive, time-consuming and possibly detrimental to our ongoing business relationships with our customers. Inaccuracies in customer royalty reports have resulted in, and could result in, additional overpayments or underpayments of royalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe currently have limited or no redundancy in our manufacturing facilities for certain products, and we may lose revenue and be unable to maintain our customer relationships if we lose our production capacity.\nWe manufacture all of our performance coating reagents (and provide coating manufacturing services for certain customers) and our IVD products at one of our Eden Prairie, Minnesota facilities. We also manufacture balloon catheter products at our facility in Ballinasloe, Ireland and catheter-based medical devices in limited quantities in one of our facilities in Eden Prairie, Minnesota. If we receive the necessary regulatory approvals, we plan to manufacture our SurVeil DCB both in our Ireland facility and in our manufacturing facility in Eden Prairie, Minnesota. If our existing production facilities become incapable of manufacturing products for any reason, we may be unable to meet production requirements, we may lose revenue and we may not be able to maintain our relationships with our customers, including certain of our licensees. In addition, because most of our customers use our performance coating reagents to manufacture their own products that generate royalty revenue for us, failure by us to supply these reagents could result in decreased royalty revenue, as well as decreased revenue from our performance coating product sales. Without our existing production facilities, we would have no other means of manufacturing products until we were able to restore the manufacturing capability at these facilities or develop one or more alternative manufacturing facilities. Although we carry business interruption insurance to cover lost revenue and profits in an amount we consider adequate, this insurance does not cover all possible situations. In addition, our business interruption insurance would not compensate us for the loss of opportunity and potential adverse impact on relations with our existing customers resulting from our inability to produce products for them.\nWe may face product liability claims related to participation in clinical trials or the use or misuse of our products.\nThe development and sale of medical devices and component products involves inherent risks of product liability claims. For medical device products that incorporate our performance coating technologies, most of the licenses provide us with indemnification against such claims. However, there can be no assurance that product liability claims will not be filed against us for such products, or for medical device products that we manufacture as part of our vascular intervention product strategy, that parties indemnifying us will have the financial ability to honor their indemnification obligations, or that such manufacturers will not seek indemnification or other relief from us for any such claims. Any product liability claims, with or without merit, could result in costly litigation, reduced sales, significant liabilities and diversion of our management\u2019s time, attention and resources. We have obtained a level of liability insurance coverage that we believe is appropriate to our activities, however, we cannot be sure that our product liability insurance coverage is adequate or that it will continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. Furthermore, we do not expect to be able to obtain insurance covering our costs and losses as a result of any recall of products or devices incorporating our technologies because of alleged defects, whether such recall is instituted by us, by a customer, or is required by a regulatory agency. A product liability claim, recall or other claim with respect to uninsured liabilities, or for amounts in excess of insured liabilities, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur revenue will be harmed if we experience disruptions in our supply chain.\nSupply chains across many industries have experienced delays and disruptions due to a wide variety of factors including labor and materials shortages and a lack of transportation capacity. A disruption in the supply of even a minor competent of a product can have a major impact on the production and delivery of that product. Further, we currently purchase some of the components we use to manufacture reagents from sole suppliers. If any of our suppliers becomes unwilling to supply components to us, experiences an interruption in its production, or is otherwise unable to provide us, on a timely basis or at all, with sufficient material to manufacture our reagents and other products, we will experience production interruptions. If we lose our sole supplier of any particular reagent component or are otherwise unable to procure all components required for our reagent manufacturing for an extended period of time, we may lose the ability to manufacture the reagents our customers require to commercialize products incorporating our technology. This could result in lost royalties and product sales, which would harm our financial results. Adding suppliers to our approved vendor list may require significant time and resources. We routinely attempt to maintain multiple suppliers of each of our significant materials, so we will have alternative suppliers, if necessary. However, if the number of suppliers of a material is reduced, or if we are otherwise unable to obtain our material requirements on a timely basis and on favorable terms, our operations may be harmed.\nWe depend upon key personnel and may not be able to attract or retain qualified personnel in the future.\nOur success depends upon our ability to retain and attract highly qualified management and technical personnel. We face intense competition for such qualified personnel. We do not maintain key person insurance, and we generally do not enter into employment agreements, except with certain executive officers. Although we have non-compete agreements with most employees, there can be no assurance that such agreements will be enforceable. The loss of the services of one or more key employees or the failure to attract and retain additional qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nWe collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, and personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, on our networks. The secure maintenance of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy, and our customers expect that we will securely maintain their information. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers resulting from employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any information technology breach could compromise our networks and the information stored on them could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under personal privacy laws and regulatory penalties, disrupt our operations and the services that we provide to our customers, damage our reputation and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, any of which could adversely affect our business and competitive position.\nOur information systems, and those of third-party suppliers with whom we contract, require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information technology, evolving systems and regulatory standards, and changing threats. These systems could be vulnerable to service interruptions or to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees, third-party vendors and/or business partners, or from cyber-attacks by malicious third parties. We also are subject to other cyber-attacks, including state-sponsored cyber-attacks, industrial espionage, insider threats, computer denial-of-service attacks, computer viruses, ransomware and other malware, payment fraud or other cyber incidents. Any significant breakdown, intrusion, breach, interruption, corruption or destruction of these systems could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation and could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nWe may not be able to obtain, maintain or protect proprietary rights necessary for the commercialization of our technologies.\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to obtain and maintain patents and trade secrets. We have been granted U.S. and foreign patents and have U.S. and foreign patent applications pending related to our proprietary technologies. There can be no assurance that any pending patent application will be approved, that we will develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable, that any patents issued will provide us with competitive advantages or will not be challenged or invalidated by third parties, that the patents of others will not prevent the commercialization of products incorporating our technologies, or that others will not independently develop similar technologies or design around our patents. Furthermore, because we generate a significant amount of our revenue through licensing arrangements, the loss or expiration of patent protection for our licensed technologies will result in a reduction of the revenue derived from these arrangements, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, results of operations, financial position and prospects.\nWe may become involved in expensive and unpredictable patent litigation or other intellectual property proceedings which could result in liability for damages or impair our development and commercialization efforts.\nOur commercial success also will depend, in part, on our ability to avoid infringing patent or other intellectual property rights of third parties. There has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device and pharmaceutical industries, and intellectual property litigation may be used against us as a means of gaining a competitive advantage. Intellectual property litigation is complex, time consuming and expensive, and the outcome of such litigation is difficult to predict. If we were found to be infringing any third-party patent or other intellectual property right, we could be required to pay significant damages, alter our products or processes, obtain licenses from others, which we may not be able to do on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, or cease commercialization of our products and processes. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPatent litigation or certain other administrative proceedings may also be necessary to enforce our patents or to determine the scope and validity of third-party proprietary rights. These activities could result in substantial cost to us, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us. An adverse outcome from any such litigation or interference proceeding could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require disputed rights to be licensed from third parties or require us to cease using our technology. Any action to defend or prosecute intellectual property would be costly and result in significant diversion of the efforts of our management and technical personnel, regardless of outcome, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to keep our trade secrets confidential, our technology and proprietary information may be used by others to compete against us.\nWe rely significantly upon proprietary technology, information, processes and know-how that are not subject to patent protection. We seek to protect this information through trade secret or confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, potential licensees, or other parties as well as through other security measures. There can be no assurance that these agreements or any security\nmeasure will provide meaningful protection for our un-patented proprietary information. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors. If we determine that our proprietary rights have been misappropriated, we may seek to enforce our rights which would draw upon our financial resources and divert the time and efforts of our management, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to convince our customers to adopt our advanced generation of hydrophilic coating technologies, our royalty revenue may decrease, and the expiration of the patent family protecting this technology has and will continue to result in a reduction of the royalty revenue associated with existing license agreements.\nIn our Medical Device segment, we have licensed our PhotoLink hydrophilic technology to a number of our customers for use in a variety of medical device surface applications. We have several U.S. and international issued patents and pending U.S. and international patent applications protecting various aspects of these technologies, including compositions, methods of manufacture, and methods of coating devices. The anticipated expiration dates of the patents range from fiscal 2026 to 2039. These patents and patent applications represent distinct families, with each family generally covering a successive generation of the technology, including improvements that enhance coating performance, manufacturability, or other important features desired by our customers.\nOur fourth-generation PhotoLink technology was protected by a family of patents that expired in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 in all countries where patent coverage existed for the technology, except in Japan, where the relevant patent expired in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Of the license agreements using our fourth-generation technologies, most continue to generate royalty revenue beyond patent expiration, but at a reduced royalty rate.\nWhile we are actively working to encourage and support our customers\u2019 adoption of our advanced generations of our hydrophilic coating technology, there can be no assurance that they will do so, or that those customers that have adopted, or will adopt, our hydrophilic coating technology will sell products utilizing our technology which will generate earned royalty revenue for us.\nIf we or any of our licensees breach any of the agreements under which we have in-licensed intellectual property from others, we could be deprived of important intellectual property rights and future revenue.\nWe are a party to various agreements through which we have in-licensed or otherwise acquired rights to certain technologies that are important to our business. In exchange for the rights granted to us under these agreements, we have agreed to meet certain research, development, commercialization, sublicensing, royalty, indemnification, insurance or other obligations. If we or one of our licensees fails to comply with these obligations set forth in the relevant agreement through which we have acquired rights, we may be unable to effectively use, license, or otherwise exploit the relevant intellectual property rights and may be deprived of current or future revenue that is associated with such intellectual property.\nRISKS RELATING TO CLINICAL AND REGULATORY MATTERS\nThe FDA has requested additional data, and may continue to make such requests, in its review of the premarket approval application for our SurVeil DCB, which may delay FDA action on the application and have an adverse impact on our operating results and cash flows.\nIn June 2021, we submitted the fourth and final module of the PMA application to the FDA related to our SurVeil DCB. In its subsequent comments on the PMA application, the FDA requested additional testing data in order to evaluate the product and its unique technologies. In October 2022, we submitted a complete response, including additional testing data, to the FDA\u2019s comments on our PMA application for the SurVeil DCB. The FDA may request additional information, including test data, related to our most recent submission in support of the PMA application.\nAs we previously have disclosed, we expect to receive a $27 million milestone payment under the Abbott Agreement following FDA approval of our PMA application, if it ultimately is granted. Further, we expect Abbott to begin commercialization of the SurVeil DCB following such approval, if granted. There can be no assurance that the SurVeil DCB will receive FDA approval. If FDA approval of the SurVeil DCB is delayed or denied, our operating results and cash flows may be materially adversely impacted.\nThe development of new products and enhancement of existing products requires significant research and development and regulatory approvals, which may require clinical trials, all of which may be very expensive and time-consuming and may not result in commercially viable products.\nThe development of new products and enhancement of existing products requires significant investment in research and development and regulatory approvals. Regulators may require successful clinical trials prior to granting approvals for new or enhanced products.\nThere can be no assurance that any products now in development, or that we may seek to develop or refine in the future, will achieve technological feasibility, obtain regulatory approval or gain market acceptance. If we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for new products or enhanced products, our ability to successfully compete in the markets in which we participate may be materially adversely impacted. A delay in the development or approval of new products and technologies may also adversely impact the timing of when these products contribute to our future revenue and earnings growth.\nDelays in clinical studies are common and have many causes, and any significant delay in clinical studies being conducted by us could result in delays in obtaining regulatory approvals and jeopardize the ability to proceed to commercialization of our products.\nWe have conducted clinical studies on DCB products, some of which are ongoing. We may conduct additional clinical studies on our DCB or other products. There are risks involved in such clinical studies, including that they may fail to enroll a sufficient number of patients for a variety of reasons or fail to be completed on schedule, if at all. Clinical studies for any of our products could be delayed or terminated for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022delays in reaching agreement with applicable regulatory authorities on a clinical study design;\n\u2022issuance of publications or communications relating to the safety of certain medical devices, including studies and communications regarding the evaluation of risks associated with paclitaxel-coated products, which resulted in a temporary pause in enrollment in our TRANSCEND clinical study in fiscal 2019;\n\u2022suspension or termination of a clinical study by us, the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities due to adverse events or safety concerns relating to our product; and\n\u2022delays in recruiting suitable patients willing to participate in a study, or delays in having patients complete participation or return for post-treatment follow-up.\nIf the initiation or completion of any of the ongoing or planned clinical studies for our products is delayed for any of the above or other reasons, the regulatory approval process would be delayed and the ability to commercialize and commence sales of our products could be materially harmed. Additionally, clinical study delays may allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do, which could impair our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe cannot be sure that clinical studies of our products will be successful, or that their results will be adequate to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals.\nWe cannot be sure that the endpoints or safety profile of any clinical trial will be met. In addition, we cannot be sure that any clinical trial that is successful will support regulatory approval of the product subject to the trial. We may expend significant financial and human capital resources on clinical trials. If they fail to achieve their endpoints, or support regulatory approvals, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nHealthcare policy changes may have a material adverse effect on us.\nHealthcare costs have risen significantly during the past decade. There have been and continue to be proposals by legislators, regulators and third-party payers to reduce healthcare expenditures. Certain proposals, if implemented, would impose limitations on the prices our customers will be able to charge for our products, or the amounts of reimbursement available for their products from governmental agencies or third-party payers, or otherwise negatively impact pricing and reimbursement. Because a significant portion of our revenue is currently derived from royalties on products that constitute a percentage of our customer\u2019s product\u2019s selling price, these limitations could have an adverse effect on our revenue.\nHealthcare reform continues to be a prominent political topic. We cannot predict what healthcare programs and regulations may ultimately be implemented at the federal or state level or the effect of any future legislation or regulation in the U.S. or internationally may have on our business.\nVascular intervention medical devices and other products incorporating our technologies are subject to increasing scrutiny and regulations, including extensive approval/clearance processes and manufacturing requirements. Any adverse regulatory and/or enforcement action (for us or our licensees) may materially affect our financial condition and business operations.\nOur products and our business activities are subject to complex regulatory regimes both in the U.S. and internationally. Additionally, certain state governments and the federal government have enacted legislation aimed at increasing transparency of industry interactions with healthcare providers. Any failure to comply with these legal and regulatory requirements could impact our business. In addition, we will continue to devote substantial human capital and financial resources to further developing and implementing policies, systems and processes to comply with enhanced legal and regulatory requirements, which may impact our business and results of operations. We anticipate that governmental authorities will continue to scrutinize our industry closely, and that additional regulation may increase compliance and legal costs, exposure to litigation, and other adverse effects to our operations.\nTo varying degrees, the FDA and comparable agencies outside the U.S. require us to comply with laws and regulations governing the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing and distribution of our products. Our compliance with these laws and regulations takes significant human capital and financial resources; involves stringent testing and surveillance; involves attention to any needed product improvements (such as modifications, repairs, or replacements); and may include significant limitations of the uses of our products.\nChanges in existing regulations or adoption of new governmental regulations or policies could prevent or delay regulatory approval of products incorporating our technologies or subject us to additional regulation. Failure or delay by us or our licensees in obtaining FDA, E.U., and other necessary regulatory approval or clearance, or the loss of previously obtained approvals, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR SECURITIES\nOur stock price has been volatile and may continue to be volatile.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile, in large part attributable to developments and circumstances related to factors identified in \u201cForward-looking Statements\u201d and \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d Our common stock price may rise or fall sharply at any time based on announcement regarding regulatory actions, our operations or our financial performance; as a result of sales executed by significant holders of our stock; because of short positions taken by investors from time to time in our stock; or due to factors unrelated to our performance, including industry-specific or general economic conditions. In addition, in the past, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. If we were to become involved in securities litigation, it could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business and harm our business, results of operations, financial condition and reputation. These factors may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 85889, "SIC": 6794, "TIC": "SRDX"}
