{"cik": "3570", "company": "Cheniere Energy, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-24", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe following are some of the important factors that could affect our financial performance or could cause actual results to differ materially from estimates or expectations contained in our forward-looking statements. We may encounter risks in addition to those described below. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us, or that we currently deem to be immaterial, may also impair or adversely affect our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, liquidity and prospects.\nThe risk factors in this report are grouped into the following categories:\n\u2022Risks Relating to Our Financial Matters;\n\u2022Risks Relating to Our Operations and Industry; and\n\u2022Risks Relating to Regulations.\nRisks Relating to Our Financial Matters\nOur existing level of cash resources and significant debt could cause us to have inadequate liquidity and could materially and adversely affect our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $1.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents, $413 million of restricted cash and cash equivalents, a total of $3.4 billion of available commitments under our credit facilities and $30.4 billion of total debt outstanding on a consolidated basis (before unamortized premium, discount and debt issuance costs). SPL, CQP, CCH and Cheniere operate with independent capital structures as further detailed in Note 11-Debt of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We incur, and will incur, significant interest expense relating to the assets at the Sabine Pass and Corpus Christi LNG terminals, and we anticipate incurring additional debt to finance the construction of Corpus Christi Stage 3. Our ability to fund our capital expenditures and refinance our indebtedness will depend on our ability to access additional project financing as well as the debt and equity capital markets. A variety of factors beyond our control could impact the availability or cost of capital, including domestic or international economic conditions, increases in key benchmark interest rates and/or credit spreads, the adoption of new or amended banking or capital market laws or regulations and the repricing of market risks and volatility in capital and financial markets. Our financing costs could increase or future borrowings or equity offerings may be unavailable to us or unsuccessful, which could cause us to be unable to pay or refinance our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. We also rely on borrowings under our credit facilities to fund our capital expenditures. If any of the lenders in the syndicates backing these facilities was unable to perform on its commitments, we may need to seek replacement financing, which may not be available as needed, or may be available in more limited amounts or on more expensive or otherwise unfavorable terms.\nOur ability to generate cash is substantially dependent upon the performance by customers under long-term contracts that we have entered into, and we could be materially and adversely affected if any significant customer fails to perform its contractual obligations for any reason.\nOur future results and liquidity are substantially dependent upon performance by our customers to make payments under long-term contracts. As of December 31, 2021, we had SPAs with terms of 10 or more years with a total of 24 different third party customers. In addition, SPLNG had TUAs with two third party customers.\nWhile substantially all of our long-term third party customer arrangements are executed with a creditworthy parent company or secured by a parent company guarantee or other form of collateral, we are nonetheless exposed to credit risk in the event of a customer default that requires us to seek recourse.\nAdditionally, our long-term SPAs entitle the customer to terminate their contractual obligations upon the occurrence of certain events, which include, but are not limited to: (1) if we fail to make available specified scheduled cargo quantities; (2) delays in the commencement of commercial operations; and (3) under the majority of our SPAs, upon the occurrence of certain events of force majeure. Under each of SPLNG\u2019s long-term TUAs, such termination events include, but are not limited to: if the Sabine Pass LNG terminal (1) experiences a force majeure delay for longer than 18 months; (2) fails to redeliver a specified amount of natural gas in accordance with the customer\u2019s redelivery nominations; or (3) fails to accept and unload a specified number of the customer\u2019s proposed LNG cargoes.\nAlthough we have not had a history of material customer default or termination events, the occurrence of such events are largely outside of our control and may expose us to unrecoverable losses. We may not be able to replace these customer arrangements on desirable terms, or at all, if they are terminated. As a result, our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur subsidiaries may be restricted under the terms of their indebtedness from making distributions under certain circumstances, which may limit CQP\u2019s ability to pay or increase distributions to us or inhibit our access to cash flows from the CCL Project and could materially and adversely affect us.\nThe agreements governing our subsidiaries\u2019 indebtedness restrict payments that our subsidiaries can make to CQP or us in certain events and limit the indebtedness that our subsidiaries can incur. For example, SPL is restricted from making distributions under agreements governing its indebtedness generally until, among other requirements, deposits are made into debt service reserve accounts and a debt service coverage ratio of 1.25:1.00 is satisfied.\nCCH is generally restricted from making distributions under agreements governing its indebtedness until, among other requirements, the completion of the construction of Trains 1 through 3 of the CCL Project, funding of a debt service reserve account equal to six months of debt service and achieving a historical debt service coverage ratio and fixed projected debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.25:1.00.\nOur subsidiaries\u2019 inability to pay distributions to CQP or us or to incur additional indebtedness as a result of the foregoing restrictions in the agreements governing their indebtedness may inhibit CQP\u2019s ability to pay or increase distributions to us and its other unitholders or inhibit our access to cash flows from the CCL Project, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nOur efforts to manage commodity and financial risks through derivative instruments, including our IPM agreements, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe use derivative instruments to manage commodity, currency and financial market risks. The extent of our derivative position at any given time depends on our assessments of the markets for these commodities and related exposures. We currently account for all derivatives at fair value, with immediate recognition of changes in the fair value in earnings. As described in Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Results of Operations, our net loss attributable to common stockholders of $2.3 billion and $85 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, was primarily due to derivative losses, with substantially all of such losses relating to commodity derivative instruments indexed to international LNG prices, mainly our IPM agreements. These transactions and other derivative transactions have and may continue to result in substantial volatility in reported results of operations, particularly in periods of significant commodity, currency or financial market variability, or as a result of ineffectiveness of these contracts. For certain of these instruments, in the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources, the value of these financial instruments involves management\u2019s judgment or use of estimates. Changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of these contracts.\nIn addition, our liquidity may be adversely impacted by the cash margin requirements of the commodities exchanges or the failure of a counterparty to perform in accordance with a contract.\nRestrictions in agreements governing us and our subsidiaries\u2019 indebtedness may prevent us and our subsidiaries from engaging in certain beneficial transactions, which could materially and adversely affect us.\nIn addition to restrictions on the ability of us, CQP, SPL and CCH to make distributions or incur additional indebtedness, the agreements governing our indebtedness also contain various other covenants that may prevent us from engaging in beneficial transactions, including limitations on our ability to:\n\u2022make certain investments;\n\u2022purchase, redeem or retire equity interests;\n\u2022issue preferred stock;\n\u2022sell or transfer assets;\n\u2022incur liens;\n\u2022enter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022consolidate, merge, sell or lease all or substantially all of our assets; and\n\u2022enter into sale and leaseback transactions.\nAny restrictions on the ability to engage in beneficial transactions could materially and adversely affect us.\nThe market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and is susceptible to fluctuations in the future due to market volatility and other factors. Our stockholders could lose all or part of their investment.\nThe market price of our common stock has historically experienced and may continue to experience volatility. For example, during the three-year period ended December 31, 2021, the market price of our common stock ranged between $27.06 and $113.40. Such fluctuations may continue as a result of a variety of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022domestic and worldwide supply of and demand for natural gas and corresponding fluctuations in the price of natural gas;\n\u2022sales of a high volume of shares of our common stock by our stockholders;\n\u2022operating and stock price performance of companies that investors deem comparable to us;\n\u2022events affecting other companies that the market deems comparable to us;\n\u2022changes in government regulation or proposals applicable to us;\n\u2022actual or potential non-performance by any customer or a counterparty under any agreement;\n\u2022announcements made by us or our competitors of significant contracts;\n\u2022changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u2022general conditions in the industries in which we operate;\n\u2022general economic conditions;\n\u2022the failure of securities analysts to cover our common stock or changes in financial or other estimates by analysts;\n\u2022changes in investor sentiment regarding the energy industry and fossil fuels;\n\u2022volatility in our earnings attributable to common stockholders, which may be impacted by our use of derivative instruments as further described in Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Results of Operations, market conditions and other factors; and\n\u2022other factors described in these \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d\nIn addition, the United States securities markets have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations have often been unrelated to the operating performance of companies in these markets. Market fluctuations and broad market, economic and industry factors may negatively affect the price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. If we were to be the object of securities class litigation as a result of volatility in our common stock price or for other reasons, it could result in substantial diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources, which could negatively affect our financial results.\nOur ability to declare and pay dividends and repurchase shares is subject to certain considerations.\nDividends are authorized and determined by our Board in its sole discretion and depend upon a number of factors, including:\n\u2022Cash available for distribution;\n\u2022Our results of operations and anticipated future results of operations;\n\u2022Our financial condition, especially in relation to the anticipated future capital needs of any expansion of our Liquefaction Facilities;\n\u2022The level of distributions paid by comparable companies;\n\u2022Our operating expenses; and\n\u2022Other factors our Board deems relevant.\nWe expect to continue to pay quarterly dividends to our stockholders; however, our Board may reduce our dividend or cease declaring dividends at any time, including if it determines that our net cash provided by operating activities, after deducting capital expenditures and investments, are not sufficient to pay our desired levels of dividends to our stockholders or to pay dividends to our stockholders at all.\nAdditionally as of December 31, 2021, $998 million of repurchase authority remained of the $1 billion share repurchase program our Board had authorized. Our share repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire a specific number of shares during any period, and our decision to commence, discontinue or resume repurchases in any period will depend on the same factors that our Board may consider when declaring dividends, among others.\nAny downward revision in the amount of dividends we pay to stockholders or the number of shares we purchase under our share repurchase program could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nWe may sell equity or equity-related securities or assets, including equity interests in CQP. Such sales could dilute our proportionate interests in our assets, business operations and proposed projects of CQP or other subsidiaries, and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe have historically pursued a number of alternatives in order to finance the construction of our Trains, including potential issuances and sales of additional equity or equity-related securities by our subsidiaries. Such sales, in one or more transactions, could dilute our proportionate indirect interests in our assets, business operations and proposed projects of CQP, including the SPL Project, or in other subsidiaries or projects, including the CCL Project. In addition, such sales, or the anticipation of such sales, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nRisks Relating to Our Operations and Industry\nCatastrophic weather events or other disasters could result in an interruption of our operations, a delay in the completion of our Liquefaction Projects, damage to our Liquefaction Projects and increased insurance costs, all of which could adversely affect us.\nHurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005, Hurricane Ike in 2008, Hurricane Harvey in 2017, Hurricanes Laura and Delta in 2020 and Winter Storm Uri in 2021 caused interruptions or temporary suspension in construction or operations at our facilities or caused minor damage to our facilities. Future storms and related storm activity and collateral effects, or other disasters such as explosions, fires, floods or accidents, could result in damage to, or interruption of operations at, the Sabine Pass LNG terminal, the Corpus Christi LNG terminal or related infrastructure, as well as delays or cost increases in the construction and the development of the Liquefaction Projects, Corpus Christi Stage 3 or our other facilities and increase our insurance premiums. The U.S. Global Change Research Program has reported that the U.S.\u2019s energy and transportation systems are expected to be increasingly disrupted by climate change and extreme weather events. An increase in frequency and severity of extreme weather events such as storms, floods, fires and rising sea levels could have an adverse effect on our operations.\nOur ability to complete development of additional Trains, including Corpus Christi Stage 3, will be contingent on our ability to obtain additional funding. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funding, we may be unable to fully execute our business strategy.\nWe continuously pursue liquefaction expansion opportunities and other projects along the LNG value chain. As described further in Items 1. and 2. Business and Properties, we are currently developing the Corpus Christi Stage 3 project, which includes an expansion adjacent to the CCL Project for up to seven midscale Trains with an expected total production capacity of over 10 mtpa of LNG. The commercial development of an LNG facility takes a number of years and requires a substantial capital investment that is dependent on sufficient funding and commercial interest, among other factors.\nWe will require significant additional funding to be able to commence construction of Corpus Christi Stage 3, and any additional expansion projects, which we may not be able to obtain at a cost that results in positive economics, or at all. The inability to achieve acceptable funding may cause a delay in the development of Corpus Christi Stage 3, or any additional expansion projects, and we may not be able to complete our business plan, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nCost overruns and delays in the completion of our expansion projects, including Corpus Christi Stage 3, as well as difficulties in obtaining sufficient financing to pay for such costs and delays, could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nWhile we expect to reach FID on Corpus Christi Stage 3, our investment decision on the project and any potential future LNG facilities relies on cost estimates developed initially through front end engineering and design studies. However, due to the size and duration of construction of an LNG facility, the actual construction costs may be significantly higher than our current estimates as a result of many factors, including but not limited to changes in scope, the ability of Bechtel and our other contractors to execute successfully under their agreements, changes in commodity prices (particularly nickel and steel), escalating labor costs and the potential need for additional funds to be expended to maintain construction schedules or comply with existing or future environmental or other regulations. As construction progresses, we may decide or be forced to submit change orders to our contractor that could result in longer construction periods, higher construction costs or both, including change orders to comply with existing or future environmental or other regulations. Additionally, our SPAs generally provide that the customer may terminate that SPA if the relevant Train does not timely commence commercial operations. As a result, any significant construction delay, whatever the cause, could have a material adverse impact on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nSignificant increases in the cost of a liquefaction project beyond the amounts that we estimate could impact the commercial viability of the project as well as require us to obtain additional sources of financing to fund our operations until the applicable liquefaction project is fully constructed (which could cause further delays), thereby negatively impacting our business and limiting our growth prospects. While historically we have not experienced cost overruns or construction delays that have had a significant adverse impact on our operations, factors giving rise to such events in the future may be outside of our control and could have a material adverse effect on our current or future business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nDisruptions to the third party supply of natural gas to our pipelines and facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nWe depend upon third party pipelines and other facilities that provide gas delivery options to our liquefaction facilities and pipelines. If the construction of new or modified pipeline connections is not completed on schedule or any pipeline connection were to become unavailable for current or future volumes of natural gas due to repairs, damage to the facility, lack of capacity, failure to replace contracted firm pipeline transportation capacity on economic terms, or any other reason, our ability to receive natural gas volumes to produce LNG or to continue shipping natural gas from producing regions or to end markets could be adversely impacted. Any significant disruption to our natural gas supply could result in a substantial reduction in our revenues under our long-term SPAs or other customer arrangements, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nWe may not be able to purchase or receive physical delivery of sufficient natural gas to satisfy our delivery obligations under the SPAs, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nUnder the SPAs with our customers, we are required to make available to them a specified amount of LNG at specified times. However, we may not be able to purchase or receive physical delivery of sufficient quantities of natural gas to satisfy those obligations, which may provide affected SPA customers with the right to terminate their SPAs. Our failure to purchase or receive physical delivery of sufficient quantities of natural gas could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nWe are subject to significant construction and operating hazards and uninsured risks, one or more of which may create significant liabilities and losses for us.\nThe construction and operation of our LNG terminals and our pipelines are, and will be, subject to the inherent risks associated with these types of operations, including explosions, breakdowns or failures of equipment, operational errors by vessel or tug operators, pollution, release of toxic substances, fires, hurricanes and adverse weather conditions and other hazards, each of which could result in significant delays in commencement or interruptions of operations and/or in damage to or destruction of our facilities or damage to persons and property. In addition, our operations and the facilities and vessels of third parties on which our operations are dependent face possible risks associated with acts of aggression or terrorism.\nWe do not, nor do we intend to, maintain insurance against all of these risks and losses. We may not be able to maintain desired or required insurance in the future at rates that we consider reasonable. The occurrence of a significant event not fully insured or indemnified against could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nWe are dependent on our EPC partners and other contractors for the successful completion of the Liquefaction Projects and any potential expansion projects, including Corpus Christi Stage 3.\nTimely and cost-effective completion of the Liquefaction Projects and any potential expansion projects in compliance with agreed specifications is central to our business strategy and is highly dependent on the performance of our EPC partners, including Bechtel, and our other contractors under their agreements. The ability of our EPC partners and our other contractors to perform successfully under their agreements is dependent on a number of factors, including their ability to:\n\u2022design and engineer each Train to operate in accordance with specifications;\n\u2022engage and retain third party subcontractors and procure equipment and supplies;\n\u2022respond to difficulties such as equipment failure, delivery delays, schedule changes and failure to perform by subcontractors, some of which are beyond their control;\n\u2022attract, develop and retain skilled personnel, including engineers;\n\u2022post required construction bonds and comply with the terms thereof;\n\u2022manage the construction process generally, including coordinating with other contractors and regulatory agencies; and\n\u2022maintain their own financial condition, including adequate working capital.\nAlthough some agreements may provide for liquidated damages if the contractor fails to perform in the manner required with respect to certain of its obligations, the events that trigger a requirement to pay liquidated damages may delay or impair the operation of the Liquefaction Projects or any expansion projects, and any liquidated damages that we receive may not be sufficient to cover the damages that we suffer as a result of any such delay or impairment. The obligations of EPC partners and our other contractors to pay liquidated damages under their agreements are subject to caps on liability, as set forth therein.\nFurthermore, we may have disagreements with our contractors about different elements of the construction process, which could lead to the assertion of rights and remedies under their contracts and increase the cost of the Liquefaction Projects and any potential expansion project or result in a contractor\u2019s unwillingness to perform further work. If any contractor is unable or unwilling to perform according to the negotiated terms and timetable of its respective agreement for any reason or terminates its agreement, we would be required to engage a substitute contractor. This would likely result in significant project delays and increased costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nThere may be impediments to the transport of LNG, such as shortages of LNG vessels worldwide or operational impacts on LNG shipping, including maritime transportation routes, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nThe construction and delivery of LNG vessels require significant capital and long construction lead times. Additionally, the availability of LNG vessels and transportation costs could be impacted to the detriment of our business and our customers because of:\n\u2022an inadequate number of shipyards constructing LNG vessels and a backlog of orders at these shipyards;\n\u2022shortages of or delays in the receipt of necessary construction materials;\n\u2022political or economic disturbances;\n\u2022acts of war or piracy;\n\u2022changes in governmental regulations or maritime self-regulatory organizations;\n\u2022work stoppages or other labor disturbances;\n\u2022bankruptcy or other financial crisis of shipbuilders or shipowners;\n\u2022quality or engineering problems;\n\u2022disruptions to maritime transportation routes; and\n\u2022weather interference or a catastrophic event, such as a major earthquake, tsunami or fire.\nCyclical or other changes in the demand for and price of LNG and natural gas may adversely affect our LNG business and the performance of our customers and could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nOur LNG business and the development of domestic LNG facilities and projects generally is based on assumptions about the future availability and price of natural gas and LNG, and the prospects for international natural gas and LNG markets. Natural gas and LNG prices have been, and are likely to continue to be, volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to one or more of the following factors:\n\u2022competitive liquefaction capacity in North America;\n\u2022insufficient or oversupply of natural gas liquefaction or receiving capacity worldwide;\n\u2022insufficient LNG tanker capacity;\n\u2022weather conditions, including temperature volatility resulting from climate change, and extreme weather events may lead to unexpected distortion in the balance of international LNG supply and demand. For example, LNG procurement in Japan rose dramatically in 2011 and several years thereafter following a tsunami that caused extensive destruction to its nuclear power infrastructure;\n\u2022reduced demand and lower prices for natural gas;\n\u2022increased natural gas production deliverable by pipelines, which could suppress demand for LNG;\n\u2022decreased oil and natural gas exploration activities which may decrease the production of natural gas, including as a result of any potential ban on production of natural gas through hydraulic fracturing;\n\u2022cost improvements that allow competitors to provide natural gas liquefaction capabilities at reduced prices;\n\u2022changes in supplies of, and prices for, alternative energy sources such as coal, oil, nuclear, hydroelectric, wind and solar energy, which may reduce the demand for natural gas;\n\u2022changes in regulatory, tax or other governmental policies regarding imported or exported LNG, natural gas or alternative energy sources, which may reduce the demand for imported or exported LNG and/or natural gas;\n\u2022political conditions in natural gas producing regions;\n\u2022sudden decreases in demand for LNG as a result of natural disasters or public health crises, including the occurrence of a pandemic, and other catastrophic events;\n\u2022adverse relative demand for LNG compared to other markets, which may decrease LNG imports into or exports from North America; and\n\u2022cyclical trends in general business and economic conditions that cause changes in the demand for natural gas.\nAdverse trends or developments affecting any of these factors could result in decreases in the price of LNG and/or natural gas, which could materially and adversely affect the performance of our customers, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nFailure of imported or exported LNG to be a competitive source of energy for the United States or international markets could adversely affect our customers and could materially and adversely affect our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nOperations of the Liquefaction Projects are dependent upon the ability of our SPA customers to deliver LNG supplies from the United States, which is primarily dependent upon LNG being a competitive source of energy internationally. The success of our business plan is dependent, in part, on the extent to which LNG can, for significant periods and in significant volumes, be supplied from North America and delivered to international markets at a lower cost than the cost of alternative energy sources. Through the use of improved exploration technologies, additional sources of natural gas may be discovered\noutside the United States, which could increase the available supply of natural gas outside the United States and could result in natural gas in those markets being available at a lower cost than LNG exported to those markets.\nAlthough SPL has entered into arrangements to utilize up to approximately three-quarters of the regasification capacity at the Sabine Pass LNG terminal in connection with operations of the SPL Project, operations at the Sabine Pass LNG terminal are dependent, in part, upon the ability of our TUA customers to import LNG supplies into the United States, which is primarily dependent upon LNG being a competitive source of energy in North America. In North America, due mainly to a historically abundant supply of natural gas and discoveries of substantial quantities of unconventional, or shale, natural gas, imported LNG has not developed into a significant energy source. The success of the regasification services component of our business plan is dependent, in part, on the extent to which LNG can, for significant periods and in significant volumes, be produced internationally and delivered to North America at a lower cost than the cost to produce some domestic supplies of natural gas, or other alternative energy sources. Through the use of improved exploration technologies, additional sources of natural gas have recently been and may continue to be discovered in North America, which could further increase the available supply of natural gas and could result in natural gas being available at a lower cost than imported LNG.\nPolitical instability in foreign countries that import or export natural gas, or strained relations between such countries and the United States, may also impede the willingness or ability of LNG purchasers or suppliers and merchants in such countries to import or export LNG from or to the United States. Furthermore, some foreign purchasers or suppliers of LNG may have economic or other reasons to obtain their LNG from, or direct their LNG to, non-U.S. markets or from or to our competitors\u2019 liquefaction or regasification facilities in the United States.\nIn addition to natural gas, LNG also competes with other sources of energy, including coal, oil, nuclear, hydroelectric, wind and solar energy. LNG from the Liquefaction Projects also competes with other sources of LNG, including LNG that is priced to indices other than Henry Hub. Some of these sources of energy may be available at a lower cost than LNG from the Liquefaction Projects in certain markets. The cost of LNG supplies from the United States, including the Liquefaction Projects, may also be impacted by an increase in natural gas prices in the United States.\nAs a result of these and other factors, LNG may not be a competitive source of energy in the United States or internationally. The failure of LNG to be a competitive supply alternative to local natural gas, oil and other alternative energy sources in markets accessible to our customers could adversely affect the ability of our customers to deliver LNG from the United States or to the United States on a commercial basis. Any significant impediment to the ability to deliver LNG to or from the United States generally, or to the Sabine Pass LNG terminal or the Corpus Christi LNG terminal or from the Liquefaction Projects specifically, could have a material adverse effect on our customers and on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nWe face competition based upon the international market price for LNG.\nOur Liquefaction Projects are subject to the risk of LNG price competition at times when we need to replace any existing SPA, whether due to natural expiration, default or otherwise, or enter into new SPAs. Factors relating to competition may prevent us from entering into a new or replacement SPA on economically comparable terms as existing SPAs, or at all. Such an event could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects. Factors which may negatively affect potential demand for LNG from our Liquefaction Projects are diverse and include, among others:\n\u2022increases in worldwide LNG production capacity and availability of LNG for market supply;\n\u2022increases in demand for LNG but at levels below those required to maintain current price equilibrium with respect to supply;\n\u2022increases in the cost to supply natural gas feedstock to our Liquefaction Projects;\n\u2022decreases in the cost of competing sources of natural gas or alternate fuels such as coal, heavy fuel oil and diesel;\n\u2022decreases in the price of non-U.S. LNG, including decreases in price as a result of contracts indexed to lower oil prices;\n\u2022increases in capacity and utilization of nuclear power and related facilities; and\n\u2022displacement of LNG by pipeline natural gas or alternate fuels in locations where access to these energy sources is not currently available.\nA cyber attack involving our business, operational control systems or related infrastructure, or that of third party pipelines which supply the Liquefaction Facilities, could negatively impact our operations, result in data security breaches, impede the processing of transactions or delay financial or compliance reporting. These impacts could materially and adversely affect our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow and liquidity.\nThe pipeline and LNG industries are increasingly dependent on business and operational control technologies to conduct daily operations. We rely on control systems, technologies and networks to run our business and to control and manage our trading, marketing, pipeline, liquefaction and shipping operations. Cyber attacks on businesses have escalated in recent years, including as a result of geopolitical tensions, and use of the internet, cloud services, mobile communication systems and other public networks exposes our business and that of other third parties with whom we do business to potential cyber attacks, including third party pipelines which supply natural gas to our Liquefaction Facilities. For example, in 2021 Colonial Pipeline suffered a ransomware attack that led to the complete shutdown of its pipeline system for six days. Should a multiple of the third party pipelines which supply our Liquefaction Facilities suffer similar concurrent attacks, the Liquefaction Facilities may not be able to obtain sufficient natural gas to operate at full capacity, or at all. A cyber attack involving our business or operational control systems or related infrastructure, or that of third party pipelines with which we do business, could negatively impact our operations, result in data security breaches, impede the processing of transactions, or delay financial or compliance reporting. These impacts could materially and adversely affect our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow and liquidity.\nWe may experience increased labor costs, and the unavailability of skilled workers or our failure to attract and retain qualified personnel could adversely affect us. In addition, changes in our senior management or other key personnel could affect our business results.\nWe are dependent upon the available labor pool of skilled employees. We compete with other energy companies and other employers to attract and retain qualified personnel with the technical skills and experience required to construct and operate our facilities and pipelines and to provide our customers with the highest quality service. We are also subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act, which governs such matters as minimum wage, overtime and other working conditions. A shortage in the labor pool of skilled workers, remoteness of our site locations or other general inflationary pressures, changes in applicable laws and regulations or labor disputes could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified personnel and could require an increase in the wage and benefits packages that we offer, thereby increasing our operating costs. Any increase in our operating costs could materially and adversely affect our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nWe depend on our executive officers for various activities. We do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our personnel. Although we have arrangements relating to compensation and benefits with certain of our executive officers, we do not have any employment contracts or other agreements with key personnel other than our employment agreement with our President and Chief Executive Officer binding them to provide services for any particular term. The loss of the services of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOutbreaks of infectious diseases, such as the outbreak of COVID-19, at one or more of our facilities could adversely affect our operations.\nOur facilities at the Sabine Pass LNG terminal and Corpus Christi LNG terminal are critical infrastructure and have continued to operate during the COVID-19 pandemic through our implementation of workplace controls and pandemic risk reduction measures. While the COVID-19 pandemic, including the Delta and Omicron variants, has had no adverse impact on our on-going operations during this time, the risk of future variants is unknown. While we believe we can continue to mitigate any significant adverse impact to our employees and operations at our critical facilities related to the virus in its current form, the outbreak of a more potent variant in the future at one or more of our facilities could adversely affect our operations.\nRisks Relating to Regulations\nFailure to obtain and maintain approvals and permits from governmental and regulatory agencies with respect to the design, construction and operation of our facilities, the development and operation of our pipelines and the export of LNG could impede operations and construction and could have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe design, construction and operation of interstate natural gas pipelines, LNG terminals, including the Liquefaction Projects, Corpus Christi Stage 3 and other facilities, as well as the import and export of LNG and the purchase and transportation of natural gas, are highly regulated activities. Approvals of the FERC and DOE under Section 3 and Section 7 of the NGA, as well as several other material governmental and regulatory approvals and permits, including several under the CAA and the CWA, are required in order to construct and operate an LNG facility and an interstate natural gas pipeline and export LNG.\nTo date, the FERC has issued orders under Section 3 of the NGA authorizing the siting, construction and operation of the six Trains and related facilities of the SPL Project, the three Trains and related facilities of the CCL Project and the seven midscale Trains and related facilities for Corpus Christi Stage 3, as well as orders under Section 7 of the NGA authorizing the construction and operation of the Creole Trail Pipeline, the Corpus Christi Pipeline and the pipeline for Corpus Christi Stage 3. To date, the DOE has also issued orders under Section 4 of the NGA authorizing SPL, CCL and Corpus Christi Stage 3 to export domestically produced LNG. Additionally, we hold certificates under Section 7(c) of the NGA that grant us land use rights relating to the situation of our pipelines on land owned by third parties. If we were to lose these rights or be required to relocate our pipelines, our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nAuthorizations obtained from the FERC, DOE and other federal and state regulatory agencies contain ongoing conditions that we must comply with. Failure to comply with such conditions, or our inability to obtain and maintain existing or newly imposed approvals and permits, filings, which may arise due to factors outside of our control such as a U.S. government disruption or shutdown, political opposition or local community resistance to the siting of LNG facilities due to safety, environmental or security concerns, could impede the operation and construction of our infrastructure. There is no assurance that we will obtain and maintain these governmental permits, approvals and authorizations, or that we will be able to obtain them on a timely basis. Any impediment could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nOur interstate natural gas pipelines and their FERC gas tariffs are subject to FERC regulation. If we fail to comply with such regulations, we could be subject to substantial penalties and fines.\nOur interstate natural gas pipelines are subject to regulation by the FERC under the NGA and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (the \u201cNGPA\u201d). The FERC regulates the purchase and transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce, including the construction and operation of pipelines, the rates, terms and conditions of service and abandonment of facilities. Under the NGA, the rates charged by our interstate natural gas pipelines must be just and reasonable, and we are prohibited from unduly preferring or unreasonably discriminating against any person with respect to pipeline rates or terms and conditions of service. If we fail to comply with all applicable statutes, rules, regulations and orders, our interstate pipelines could be subject to substantial penalties and fines.\nIn addition, as a natural gas market participant, should we fail to comply with all applicable FERC-administered statutes, rules, regulations and orders, we could be subject to substantial penalties and fines. Under the EPAct, the FERC has civil penalty authority under the NGA and the NGPA to impose penalties for current violations of up to $1.3 million per day for each violation.\nExisting and future environmental and similar laws and governmental regulations could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating costs or construction costs and restrictions.\nOur business is and will be subject to extensive federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations applicable to our construction and operation activities relating to, among other things, air quality, water quality, waste management, natural resources and health and safety. Many of these laws and regulations, such as the CAA, the Oil Pollution Act, the CWA and the RCRA, and analogous state laws and regulations, restrict or prohibit the types, quantities and concentration of substances that can be released into the environment in connection with the construction and operation of our facilities, and require us to maintain permits and provide governmental authorities with access to our facilities for inspection and reports related to our\ncompliance. In addition, certain laws and regulations authorize regulators having jurisdiction over the construction and operation of our LNG terminals and pipelines, including FERC and PHMSA, to issue compliance orders, which may restrict or limit operations or increase compliance or operating costs. Violation of these laws and regulations could lead to substantial liabilities, compliance orders, fines and penalties or to capital expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects. Federal and state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or the lawfulness of the original conduct, for the release of certain types or quantities of hazardous substances into the environment. As the owner and operator of our facilities, we could be liable for the costs of cleaning up hazardous substances released into the environment at or from our facilities and for resulting damage to natural resources.\nIn 2009, the EPA promulgated and finalized the Mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule requiring annual reporting of GHG emissions from stationary sources in a variety of industries. In 2010, the EPA expanded the rule to include reporting obligations for LNG terminals. In addition, the EPA has defined GHG emissions thresholds that would subject GHG emissions from new and modified industrial sources to regulation if the source is subject to PSD Permit requirements due to its emissions of non-GHG criteria pollutants. While the EPA subsequently took a number of additional actions primarily relating to GHG emissions from the electric power generation and the oil and gas exploration and production industries, those rules were largely stayed or repealed during the Trump Administration including by amendments adopted by the EPA on February 23, 2018 and additional amendments to new source performance standards for the oil and gas industry on September 14 and 15, 2020. On November 15, 2021, the EPA proposed new regulations to reduce methane emissions from both new and existing sources within the Crude Oil and Natural Gas source category. The proposed regulations, if finalized, would result in more stringent requirements for new sources, expand the types of new sources covered, and for the first time, establish emissions guidelines for existing sources in the Crude Oil and Natural Gas source category. In addition, other federal and state initiatives may be considered in the future to address GHG emissions through, for example, United States treaty commitments, direct regulation, market-based regulations such as a carbon emissions tax or cap-and-trade programs or clean energy standards. Such initiatives could affect the demand for or cost of natural gas, which we consume at our terminals, or could increase compliance costs for our operations. We are supportive of regulations reducing GHG emissions over time.\nOther future legislation and regulations, such as those relating to the transportation and security of LNG imported to or exported from our terminals or climate policies of destination countries in relation to their obligations under the Paris Agreement or other national climate change-related policies, could cause additional expenditures, restrictions and delays in our business and to our proposed construction activities, the extent of which cannot be predicted and which may require us to limit substantially, delay or cease operations in some circumstances. Revised, reinterpreted or additional laws and regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating or construction costs and restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nPipeline safety and compliance programs and repairs may impose significant costs and liabilities on us.\nThe PHMSA requires pipeline operators to develop management programs to safely operate and maintain their pipelines and to comprehensively evaluate certain areas along their pipelines and take additional measures where necessary to protect pipeline segments located in \u201chigh or moderate consequence areas\u201d where a leak or rupture could potentially do the most harm. As an operator, we are required to:\n\u2022perform ongoing assessments of pipeline safety and compliance;\n\u2022identify and characterize applicable threats to pipeline segments that could impact a \u201chigh consequence area\u201d;\n\u2022improve data collection, integration and analysis;\n\u2022repair and remediate the pipeline as necessary; and\n\u2022implement preventative and mitigating actions.\nWe are required to maintain pipeline integrity testing programs that are intended to assess pipeline integrity. Any repair, remediation, preventative or mitigating actions may require significant capital and operating expenditures. Should we fail to comply with applicable statutes and the Office of Pipeline Safety\u2019s rules and related regulations and orders, we could be subject to significant penalties and fines, which for certain violations can aggregate up to as high as $2.3 million.\nAdditions or changes in tax laws and regulations could potentially affect our financial results.\nWe are subject to various types of tax arising from normal business operations in the jurisdictions in which we operate and transact. Any changes to local, domestic or international tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application, including those with retroactive effect, could affect our tax obligations, profitability and cash flows in the future.\nAdditionally, there have been a number of tax reform proposals introduced in Congress recently that have proposed applying a corporate level tax to oil and gas master limited partnerships, such as CQP. If such a proposal were to be enacted, it would represent a substantial departure from current tax law, subjecting CQP to an entity level corporate tax, which could adversely impact the cash distributions that we receive from CQP. In addition, tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we operate may change significantly due to political or economic factors beyond our control. We continuously monitor and assess proposed tax legislation that could negatively impact our business.", "PERMNO": 84723, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "LNG"}
