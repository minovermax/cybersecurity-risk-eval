RISK FACTORS\nBFC Financial Corporation Risks\nBFC and its subsidiaries are subject to various risks and uncertainties relating to or arising out of the nature of their businesses, operations and investments, and general business, economic, financing, legal, regulatory, and other factors and conditions. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to either predict all risk factors or assess the impact of any factor, or combination of factors, on BFC or its subsidiaries, including with respect to their operations, results and financial condition.\nBFC has in the past incurred cash flow deficits at its parent company level and will rely on dividends from its subsidiaries in the future.\nBFC is engaged in making investments in operating businesses. Historically, BFC, at its parent company level, has not had revenue generating operating activities and has incurred cash flow deficits. BFC has financed operating cash flow deficits, and its operations and investments with available working capital, issuances of equity or debt securities, dividends from its subsidiaries and borrowings. As of December 31, 2015, BFC has $10.0 million available under the Loan and Security Agreement entered into during July 2015 which allows for borrowings by the company of up to $10 million on a revolving basis. In addition, the payment of dividends by BBX Capital requires the declaration of such dividend by BBX Capital's board of directors; a majority of whom are independent under the listing standards of the -NYSE and, accordingly, such decision is not in BFC's control. Further, declaration of dividends by Bluegreen to Woodbridge are subject to the approval of Bluegreen\u2019s Board of Directors and certain of Bluegreen's credit facilities contain terms which may limit the payment of cash dividends without the lender's consent or waiver. Decisions with respect to dividends by BBX Capital and Bluegreen are generally based on, among other things, the applicable company's operating results, financial condition, cash flow, and liquidity needs. BFC relies on dividends from Woodbridge in order to fund its current and future operations and investments; however, dividends by Woodbridge are dependent on the receipt of dividends from Bluegreen and are subject to the approval of the boards of directors of both BFC and BBX Capital. Dividends from Woodbridge may not be paid to BFC to the extent or when anticipated or at all.\nIf cash flow is not sufficient to fund BFC's liquidity needs or BFC otherwise determines it is advisable to do so, BFC might seek to liquidate some of its investments or seek to fund its operations with the proceeds of additional equity or debt financing. Such financing may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, and if BFC chooses to liquidate its investments, it may be forced to do so at depressed prices.\nAdverse conditions and events where BFC\u2019s investments are currently concentrated or in the industries in which its subsidiaries operate could adversely impact its results and future growth.\nBBX Capital's real estate related operations, activities and investments are concentrated in Florida. Adverse economic conditions, natural disasters, including tropical storms and hurricanes, which are a permanent risk in Florida, or adverse changes in laws or regulations applicable to BFC or the companies in which BFC holds investments have in the past adversely impacted and may in the future adversely impact BFC's operating results and financial condition.\nBFC and its subsidiaries may issue additional securities and incur additional indebtedness.\nIf BFC's cash flow is not sufficient to meet its liquidity needs and investment objectives or BFC's board of directors otherwise determines it to be appropriate, BFC may seek to raise funds in the future through the issuance of debt or equity securities. There is generally no restriction on BFC's ability to issue debt or equity securities which are pari passu or have a preference over its Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock, although the holders of BFC\u2019s Class B Common Stock have special class voting rights under BFC\u2019s Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation with respect to certain securities issuances and other actions affecting BFC\u2019s Class B Common Stock. Any such issuance, including shares issued in connection with any investment or acquisition which BFC makes in the future, may be dilutive to BFC's shareholders. In addition, any securities issuances in the future by a subsidiary of BFC may dilute BFC's economic investment or voting interest in that company.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nFurther, BFC and its subsidiaries have in the past and may in the future incur significant amounts of debt. Such indebtedness could have several important effects, including, without limitation, that BFC or its subsidiaries, as applicable, may be required to use available cash for the payment of principal and interest due on its debt, that outstanding indebtedness and leverage will impact the liquidity of BFC or its subsidiaries, as applicable, and that outstanding indebtedness will increase the impact which negative changes in general economic and industry conditions may have on BFC or its subsidiaries.\nBFC faces risks and uncertainties with respect to any acquisitions which it or its subsidiaries pursue in the future and there is no assurance that its investments will generate income or that BFC will exit any of its investments for a profit.\nBFC has in the past focused and continues to focus on providing strategic support to its existing investments with a view to the improved performance of the organization as a whole. However, BFC may also seek to make opportunistic investments outside of its existing portfolio, including investments in real estate based opportunities and middle market operating businesses. While BFC will seek investments and acquisitions primarily in companies that it believes will provide opportunities for growth, BFC may not be successful in identifying these opportunities. Investments or acquisitions that BFC does make may not prove to be successful or even if successful may not generate income, or may generate income on an irregular basis or over a long time period, which would cause BFC's results of operations to vary significantly on a quarterly basis and from year to year. Acquisitions may expose BFC to additional risks and may have a material adverse effect on its results of operations. Any acquisition made may fail to accomplish the strategic objectives hoped or otherwise not perform as expected or adversely impact BFC's financial condition or operating results. In addition, BFC from time to time may consider transactions involving the sale of its subsidiaries or investments or other transactions which would result in a decrease in BFC\u2019s ownership interest in its subsidiaries, and there is no assurance that any such transactions, if pursued and consummated will generate a profit or otherwise be advantageous to BFC. Acquisitions and investments will also expose BFC, or increase BFC\u2019s exposure in the case of acquisitions of or additional investments in its portfolio companies, to the risks of any business acquired or invested in.\nIn addition, there is significant competition for investments and acquisitions, which could increase the costs associated with the investment or acquisition. Substantial costs are incurred in connection with the evaluation of potential acquisition and investment opportunities whether or not the acquisition or investment is ultimately consummated. Further, such investments or acquisitions may rely on additional debt or equity financing, which will subject BFC to the risks and uncertainties described in the preceding risk factor. If BFC requires additional financing in the future, the financing may not be available when needed or on favorable terms, if at all. Additionally, BFC does not intend to seek shareholder approval of any investments or acquisitions unless required by law or regulation or by BFC\u2019s Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws.\nSubstantial sales of BFC\u2019s Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock could adversely affect the market prices of such securities.\nSubstantial sales of BFC\u2019s Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock, including sales of shares by controlling shareholders and management, or shares issued in connection with any investments or acquisition that BFC makes in the future, could adversely affect the market prices of such securities. Management has in the past and may in the future enter into Rule 10b5-1 plans pursuant to which a significant number of shares are sold into the open market.\nAlan B. Levan and John E. Abdo's control position may adversely affect the market price of BFC's Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock.\nAlan B. Levan, the former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of BFC, and John E. Abdo, the current Vice Chairman of BFC, and their respective affiliates currently collectively beneficially own shares of BFC's Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock representing approximately 63% of the general voting power and approximately 24% of the total outstanding common stock of BFC. These shares consist of 11,291,413 shares, or approximately 15%, of BFC's Class A Common Stock and 10,416,386 shares, or approximately 76%, of BFC's Class B Common Stock. In addition, each has been granted restricted securities which vest over time. Messrs. Levan and Abdo are parties to an agreement pursuant to which Mr. Levan has agreed to vote his shares of BFC's Class B Common Stock in favor of the election of Mr. Abdo to BFC's board of directors for so long as he is willing and able to serve as a BFC director. Additionally, Mr. Abdo has agreed to vote the shares of BFC's Class B Common Stock he owns in the same manner that Mr.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nLevan votes his shares of BFC's Class B Common Stock. Mr. Abdo has also agreed, subject to certain exceptions, not to transfer certain of his shares of BFC's Class B Common Stock and to obtain the consent of Mr. Levan prior to the conversion of certain of his shares of BFC's Class B Common Stock into shares of BFC's Class A Common Stock. Because BFC's Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock vote as a single class on most matters, Messrs. Levan and Abdo effectively have the voting power to elect the members of BFC's board of directors and to control the outcome of any other vote of BFC's shareholders, except in those limited circumstances where Florida law mandates that the holders of BFC's Class A Common Stock vote as a separate class. Messrs. Levan and Abdo's control position may have an adverse effect on the market price of BFC's Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock. In addition, their interests may conflict with the interests of BFC's other shareholders.\nThe loss of the services of BFC's key management and personnel could adversely affect its business and the businesses of its subsidiaries.\nBFC's ability to successfully implement its business strategy will depend on its ability to attract and retain experienced and knowledgeable management and other professional staff. BFC may not be successful in attracting and retaining key management personnel. Our business operations could be adversely affected if we are unable to retain and motivate our existing employees and attract new employees as needed. In addition, as described in further detail in \u201cItem 3 - Legal Proceedings\u201d, the jury in the SEC action against BBX Capital and Alan B. Levan found that BBX Capital and Alan B. Levan committed violations of federal securities laws, which included a two year bar on Mr. Levan serving as an officer or director of a public company. While BBX Capital and Mr. Levan appealed the adverse judgment to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, the results of appellate review are uncertain, and BFC, BBX Capital and their subsidiaries may be adversely impacted by the loss of services of Mr. Alan Levan as BFC\u2019s and BBX Capital\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Alan Levan resigned as BFC\u2019s and BBX Capital\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer on December 23, 2015. Jarett Levan, a director and Executive Vice President of BFC and a director and President of BBX Capital has been appointed acting Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of BFC and BBX Capital. In addition, John E. Abdo, continues to serve as Vice Chairman of BFC and BBX Capital.\nProvisions in BFC's Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, as well as BFC's shareholder rights plan, may make it difficult for a third party to acquire BFC and could impact the price of BFC's Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock.\nBFC's Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws contain provisions that could delay, defer or prevent a change of control of BFC or its management. These provisions could make it more difficult for shareholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. As a result, these provisions could limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of BFC's Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock. These provisions include:\n\u00b7\nthe provisions in BFC's Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation regarding the special voting rights of BFC's Class B Common Stock;\n\u00b7\nsubject to the special class voting rights of holders of BFC\u2019s Class B Common Stock under certain circumstances, the authority of BFC's board of directors to issue additional shares of common or preferred stock and to fix the relative rights and preferences of the preferred stock without additional shareholder approval; and\n\u00b7\nadvance notice procedures to be complied with by shareholders in order to make shareholder proposals or nominate directors.\nIn addition, BFC currently has in place a shareholder rights plan which is designed to preserve certain tax benefits available to BFC. However, because the rights plan provides a deterrent to investors from acquiring a 5% or greater ownership aggregate interest in BFC's Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock, it may have an anti-takeover effect.\nBBX Capital's Restated Articles of Incorporation and Amended Restated Bylaws contain similar provisions as those described above. BBX Capital also has a shareholder rights plan similar to BFC\u2019s with respect to the acquisition of more than 5% of BBX Capital\u2019s Class A Common Stock. See \"Risks Related to BBX Capital.\u201d\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nDividends and distributions from BFC\u2019s subsidiaries to their respective parent companies may be subject to claims in the future from creditors of the subsidiary.\nSubsidiaries have in the past and may in the future make dividends or distributions to their parent companies. During 2014 and 2015, Bluegreen paid dividends totaling $71.5 million and $54.4 million, respectively, to its parent company, Woodbridge, and Woodbridge paid dividends totaling $37.3 million and $28.0 million, respectively, to BFC and $31.8 million and $23.8 million, respectively, to BBX Capital. Dividend payments and other distributions by a subsidiary to its parent company may, in certain circumstances, be subject to claims made by creditors of the subsidiary which made the payment or distribution. Any such claim, if successful, may have a material adverse impact on the financial condition of the parent company against which the claim was brought.\nThere are inherent uncertainties involved in estimates, judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Any changes in estimates, judgments and assumptions used could have a material adverse effect on BFC\u2019s financial position and operating results.\nThe consolidated financial statements included in the periodic reports BFC files with the SEC, including this Annual Report on Form 10-K, are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP involves making estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets (including goodwill and other intangible assets), liabilities and related reserves, revenues, expenses and income. This includes estimates, judgments and assumptions for assessing the amortization/accretion of purchase accounting fair value differences and the future value of goodwill and other intangible assets pursuant to applicable accounting guidance. BFC bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that BFC believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. However, estimates, judgments and assumptions are subject to change in the future, and BFC's estimates, judgments and assumptions may prove to be incorrect and BFC's actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. If any estimates, judgments or assumptions change in the future, or BFC's actual results differ from BFC's estimates or assumptions, BFC may be required to record additional expenses or impairment charges, which would be recorded as a charge against its earnings and could have a material adverse impact on its financial condition and operating results.\nBFC\u2019s investment in BBX Capital is subject to equity pricing risks.\nBBX Capital's Class A Common Stock is currently listed for trading on the NYSE. Because BBX Capital is consolidated in BFC's financial statements, the decline in the market price of BBX Capital's Class A Common Stock would not impact BFC's consolidated financial statements. However, the market price of BFC's Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock, which is important to its valuation and ability to obtain equity or debt financing, would likely be adversely affected by a decline in the market price of BBX Capital's Class A Common Stock. The market price of BBX Capital's Class A Common Stock is subject to a number of factors, many of which may be beyond the control of BBX Capital, including general economic trends and conditions. In addition, BFC's control position with respect to BBX Capital may have an adverse effect on the market price of BBX Capital's Class A Common Stock.\nCertain members of BFC\u2019s board of directors and certain of BFC's executive officers are also directors and executive officers of BBX Capital and directors of Bluegreen.\nJarett S. Levan, Acting Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President of BFC, and John E. Abdo, BFC's Vice Chairman, are also directors and executive officers of BBX Capital. Mr. Abdo is also Chairman of Bluegreen. Further, Seth M. Wise, an executive officer and director of the Company, and Raymond S. Lopez, an executive officer of the Company, are each executive officers of BBX Capital. The Company and BBX Capital own 54% and 46%, respectively, of the outstanding equity interests in Woodbridge, which is the sole shareholder of Bluegreen. None of BFC \u2018s executive officers is obligated to allocate a specific amount of time to the management of BFC, and they may devote more time and attention to the operations of BFC's affiliates than they devote directly to BFC's operations.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nPending legal proceedings and the impact of any finding of liability or damages could adversely impact BFC and its financial condition and operating results.\nBFC and its subsidiaries are subject to the pending legal proceedings described in \"Item 3 - Legal Proceedings,\" as well as proceedings that may arise from time to time. The impact of any funding of liability or damages could adversely impact BFC and its financial condition and operating results.\nBFC and its subsidiaries are subject to environmental laws related to their real estate activities and the cost of compliance could adversely affect the businesses of BFC and its subsidiaries.\nAs current or previous owners or operators of real property, BFC and its subsidiaries may be liable under federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on, under or in the property. These laws often impose liability whether or not BFC or its subsidiaries knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. The cost of investigating, remediating or removing such hazardous or toxic substances may be substantial.\nInformation technology failures and data security breaches could harm our business.\nThe Company relies on information technology (IT) systems, including Internet sites, data hosting facilities and other hardware and platforms, some of which are hosted by third parties. These IT systems, like those of most companies, may be vulnerable to a variety of interruptions, including, but not limited to, natural disasters, telecommunications failures, hackers, and other security issues. Moreover, the Company\u2019s computer systems, like those of most companies, may become subject to computer viruses or other malicious codes, and to cyber or phishing-attacks. Although administrative and technical controls have been implemented which attempt to minimize the risk of cyber incidents, computer intrusion efforts are becoming increasingly sophisticated, and any enhanced controls installed might be breached. If the IT systems cease to function properly, the Company could suffer interruptions in its operations. If the cyber-security is breached, unauthorized persons may gain access to the proprietary or confidential information of BFC and its subsidiaries, including information about borrowers, employees or investments. This could require the Company to incur significant costs to comply with legally required protocols and to repair or restore the security of its systems\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nRisks Related to Bluegreen\nBluegreen is subject to various risks and uncertainties relating to or arising out of the nature of its business and general business, economic, financing, legal and other factors or conditions that may affect Bluegreen. Moreover, Bluegreen operates in a very competitive, highly regulated and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to either predict all risk factors, or assess the impact of all risk factors on Bluegreen\u2019s business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may affect Bluegreen\u2019s business.\nBluegreen\u2019s business and operations, including its ability to market VOIs, are subject to risks related to general economic conditions and the availability of financing.\nBluegreen\u2019s business is subject to risks related to general economic and industry conditions and trends. Bluegreen\u2019s results, operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by unfavorable general economic and industry conditions, such as high unemployment rates and job insecurity, declines in discretionary spending, declines in real estate values and the occurrence of geopolitical conflicts including if these or other factors adversely impact the availability of financing for Bluegreen or Bluegreen\u2019s customers or the ability of Bluegreen\u2019s customers\u2019 to otherwise pay amounts owed under notes receivable. Further, adverse changes affecting the vacation ownership industry, such as an oversupply of vacation ownership units, a reduction in demand for such units, changes in travel, demographic and vacation patterns, changes in governmental regulation of the industry, imposition of increased taxes by governmental authorities, the declaration of bankruptcy and/or credit defaults by other vacation ownership companies and negative publicity for the industry, could also have a material adverse effect on Bluegreen\u2019s business. In addition, Bluegreen's operations and results may be negatively impacted if Bluegreen is unable to update its business strategy over time and from time to time in response to changing economic and industry conditions.\nThe vacation ownership and hospitality industries are highly competitive, and Bluegreen may not be able to compete successfully.\nBluegreen competes with various high profile and well-established operators, many of which have greater liquidity and financial resources than Bluegreen. Many of the world's most recognized lodging, hospitality and entertainment companies develop and sell time-share units or VOIs in resort properties. Bluegreen also competes with numerous smaller owners and operators of vacation ownership resorts. Bluegreen's ability to remain competitive and to attract and retain customers depends on its customers' satisfaction with its products and services as well as on distinguishing the quality, value, and efficiency of its products and services from those offered by its competitors. Customer dissatisfaction with experiences at its resorts or otherwise as a member of the Bluegreen Vacation Club, including due to an inability to use points for desired stays, could result in negative publicity and/or a decrease in sales, or otherwise adversely impact Bluegreen's ability to successfully compete in the vacation ownership and hospitality industries. Bluegreen may not be able to timely and sufficiently identify and remediate the cause of customer dissatisfaction. Any of these events could materially and adversely impact Bluegreen's operating results and financial condition.\nBluegreen would suffer substantial losses and Bluegreen\u2019s liquidity position could be adversely impacted if the customers to whom Bluegreen provides financing default on their obligations.\nPrior to December 15, 2008, Bluegreen did not perform credit checks on the purchasers of its VOIs in connection with Bluegreen\u2019s financing of their purchases. Effective December 15, 2008, Bluegreen implemented a FICO\u00ae score-based credit underwriting program. Bluegreen enhanced this credit underwriting program starting in January 2010. While Bluegreen\u2019s loan portfolio originated after December 15, 2008 has to date experienced defaults at a lower rate than loans originated prior to that date, Bluegreen\u2019s FICO\u00ae score-based underwriting standards may not continue to result in decreased default rates or otherwise result in the improved performance of Bluegreen\u2019s notes receivable. Adverse conditions in the mortgage industry, including credit availability, borrowers\u2019 financial profiles, prepayment rates and other factors, including those outside Bluegreen\u2019s control, may increase the default rates Bluegreen experiences or otherwise negatively impact the performance of its notes receivable. Although in many cases Bluegreen may have recourse against a buyer for the unpaid purchase price, certain states have laws that limit Bluegreen\u2019s ability to recover personal judgments against customers who have defaulted on their loans or Bluegreen may determine that the cost of doing so may not be justified. Historically, Bluegreen has generally not pursued such recourse against its customers. In the case of Bluegreen\u2019s notes receivable secured by VOIs, if Bluegreen is unable to collect the defaulted amount due, Bluegreen traditionally has terminated the customer\u2019s interest in the Bluegreen Vacation Club and then remarketed the recovered VOI. Irrespective of Bluegreen\u2019s remedy in the event of a default,\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nBluegreen cannot recover the marketing, selling and administrative costs associated with the original sale and such costs generally exceed the cash received by Bluegreen from the buyer at the time of the sale. In addition, Bluegreen will need to incur such costs again in order to resell the VOI. If default rates for Bluegreen\u2019s borrowers remain at current levels or increase, Bluegreen may be required to increase its provision for credit losses. In addition, it may cause buyers of, or lenders whose loans are secured by, Bluegreen\u2019s VOI notes receivable to reduce the amount of availability or advance rates under receivables purchase and credit facilities, or to increase the interest costs associated with such facilities. In such an event, the cost of financing may increase and Bluegreen may not be able to secure replacement or alternative financing on terms acceptable to Bluegreen, if at all, which would adversely affect Bluegreen\u2019s earnings, financial position and liquidity.\nUnder the terms of Bluegreen\u2019s pledged and receivable sale facilities, Bluegreen may be required, under certain circumstances, to replace receivables or to pay down the loan to within permitted loan-to-value ratios. Additionally, the terms of Bluegreen\u2019s securitization transactions require Bluegreen to repurchase or replace loans if Bluegreen breaches any of the representations and warranties Bluegreen made at the time Bluegreen sold the receivables. These agreements also often include provisions that in the event of defaults or delinquencies by customers in excess of stated thresholds, or if other performance thresholds are not met, will require substantially all of Bluegreen\u2019s cash flow from its retained interest in the receivable portfolios sold to be paid to the parties who purchased the receivables from Bluegreen.\nWhile Bluegreen has attempted to restructure its business to reduce its need for and reliance on financing for liquidity in the short term, there is no assurance that Bluegreen\u2019s business and profitability will not be impacted by its ability to obtain financing, which may not be available on favorable terms, or at all.\nIn connection with sales of VOIs, Bluegreen may offer financing to the purchaser of up to 90% of the purchase price of the VOI. However, Bluegreen incurs selling, marketing and administrative cash expenditures prior to and concurrent with the sale. These costs generally exceed the down payment Bluegreen receives at the time of the sale. Accordingly, Bluegreen\u2019s ability to borrow against or sell its notes receivable has historically been a critical factor in Bluegreen\u2019s continued liquidity, and Bluegreen therefore has depended on funds from its credit facilities and securitization transactions to finance its operations. If Bluegreen\u2019s pledged receivables facilities terminate or expire and Bluegreen is unable to extend them or replace them with comparable facilities, or if Bluegreen is unable to continue to participate in securitization-type transactions and \u201cwarehouse\u201d facilities on acceptable terms, Bluegreen\u2019s liquidity, cash flow and profitability would be materially and adversely affected. Credit market disruptions have in the past adversely impacted the willingness of banks and other finance companies to provide \u201cwarehouse\u201d lines of credit for VOI receivables and resulted from time to time in the term securitization market being unavailable. Future credit market disruptions may have similar effects or otherwise make obtaining additional and replacement external sources of liquidity more difficult and more costly.\nIn addition, financing for real estate acquisition and development and the capital markets for corporate debt is cyclical. In response to changing conditions, during 2008, Bluegreen adopted initiatives, which included limiting sales and encouraging higher down payments on sales, in an attempt to conserve cash. Bluegreen also increased its focus on expanding its fee-based service business. However, there is no assurance that these initiatives will enhance Bluegreen\u2019s financial position or otherwise be successful in the long term.\nNotwithstanding the initiatives implemented by Bluegreen to improve its cash position, Bluegreen anticipates that it will continue to seek and use external sources of liquidity, including funds that Bluegreen obtains pursuant to additional borrowings under its existing credit facilities, under credit facilities that Bluegreen may obtain in the future, under securitizations in which Bluegreen may participate in the future or pursuant to other borrowing arrangements, to:\n\u00b7\nsupport Bluegreen\u2019s operations and pay dividends;\n\u00b7\nfinance the acquisition and development of VOI inventory or property and equipment;\n\u00b7\nfinance a substantial percentage of Bluegreen\u2019s sales; and\n\u00b7\nsatisfy Bluegreen\u2019s debt and other obligations.\nBluegreen\u2019s ability to service or refinance its indebtedness or to obtain additional financing (including its ability to consummate future term securitizations) depends on the credit markets and on Bluegreen\u2019s future performance, which is subject to a number of factors, including the success of Bluegreen\u2019s business, Bluegreen\u2019s results of operations, leverage, financial condition and business prospects, prevailing interest rates, general economic conditions, the performance of Bluegreen\u2019s receivables portfolio, and perceptions about the vacation ownership and real estate industries. Further, reputational and other risks to both the lender and to Bluegreen associated with the\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n2007 bankruptcy of Levitt and Sons, LLC, a former wholly owned homebuilding subsidiary of Woodbridge, and the adverse jury verdict in the litigation brought by the SEC against BBX Capital and its former Chairman, Alan B. Levan, who was also Chairman of Bluegreen until December 2015 may be considered by lenders in connection with both making and renewing extensions of credit.\nAs of December 31, 2015, Bluegreen had $31.2 million of indebtedness scheduled to become due during 2016. Historically, much of Bluegreen\u2019s debt has been renewed or refinanced in the ordinary course of business. However, there is no assurance that Bluegreen will in the future be able to obtain sufficient external sources of liquidity on attractive terms, or at all, or otherwise renew, extend or refinance all or any portion of its outstanding debt. Any of these occurrences may have a material adverse impact on Bluegreen\u2019s liquidity and financial condition.\nBluegreen's indebtedness may impact its financial condition and results of operations, and the terms of Bluegreen's indebtedness may limit its activities.\nBluegreen's level of debt and debt service requirements have several important effects on Bluegreen's operations. Significant debt service cash requirements reduce the funds available for operations and future business opportunities and increase Bluegreen's vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions, as well as conditions in the credit markets generally. In addition, Bluegreen's leverage position increases its vulnerability to economic and competitive pressures and may limit funds available for acquisitions, working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, and other general corporate purposes. Further, the financial covenants and other restrictions contained in indentures, credit agreements and other agreements relating to Bluegreen's indebtedness require Bluegreen to meet certain financial tests and restrict Bluegreen's ability to, among other things, pay dividends, borrow additional funds, dispose of assets or make investments. If Bluegreen fails to comply with the terms of its debt instruments, such debt may become due and payable immediately, which would have a material adverse impact on Bluegreen's cash position and financial condition. Significant resources may be required to monitor Bluegreen's compliance with its debt instruments (from a quantitative and qualitative perspective), and such monitoring efforts may not be effective in all cases.\nTo the extent inflationary trends, tightened credit markets or other factors affect interest rates, Bluegreen\u2019s debt service costs may increase. If interest rates increased one percentage point, the effect on interest expense related to Bluegreen\u2019s variable-rate debt would be an annual increase of $2.8 million, based on December 31, 2015 balances.\nThe ratings of third-party rating agencies could adversely impact Bluegreen\u2019s ability to obtain, renew or extend credit facilities, or otherwise raise funds.\nRating agencies from time to time review prior corporate and specific transaction ratings in light of tightened ratings criteria. In December 2015, Standard & Poor\u2019s Rating Services affirmed Bluegreen\u2019s \u2018B+\u2019 credit rating. Bluegreen\u2019s corporate credit rating is also based, in part, on rating agencies\u2019 speculation about Bluegreen\u2019s potential future debt and dividend levels. If rating agencies were to downgrade Bluegreen\u2019s corporate credit ratings, Bluegreen\u2019s ability to raise funds on favorable terms, or at all, and Bluegreen\u2019s liquidity, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted. In addition, if rating agencies downgraded their original ratings on certain bond classes in Bluegreen\u2019s securitizations, holders of such bonds may be required to sell bonds in the marketplace, and such sales could occur at a discount, which could impact the perceived value of the bonds and Bluegreen\u2019s ability to sell future bonds on favorable terms or at all. While Bluegreen is not currently aware of any reasonably likely downgrades to its corporate credit rating or the ratings of bond classes in its securitizations, such ratings changes can occur without advance notice.\nBluegreen\u2019s future success depends on its ability to market its products and services successfully and efficiently and Bluegreen\u2019s marketing expenses may increase.\nBluegreen competes for customers with hotel and resort properties and other vacation ownership resorts. The identification of sales prospects and leads, and the marketing of Bluegreen\u2019s products and services to them are essential to Bluegreen\u2019s success. Bluegreen incurs expenses associated with marketing programs in advance of the closing of sales. If Bluegreen\u2019s lead identification and marketing efforts do not yield enough leads or Bluegreen is unable to successfully convert sales leads to sales, Bluegreen may be unable to recover the expense of its marketing programs and systems and its business, operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected. In addition, Bluegreen is currently focusing and has increased its marketing efforts on selling to new customers, which typically involves a relatively higher marketing cost compared to sales to existing owners and therefore has increased and is expected to continue to increase Bluegreen\u2019s sales and marketing expenses. If Bluegreen is not\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nsuccessful in offsetting the cost increase with greater sales revenue, Bluegreen\u2019s operating results and financial condition would be adversely impacted. In addition, Bluegreen's marketing efforts are subject to the risk of changing consumer behavior. Changes in consumer behavior may adversely impact the effectiveness of marketing efforts and strategies which Bluegreen has in place and Bluegreen may not be able to timely and effectively respond to such changes.\nBluegreen generates a significant portion of its new sales prospects and leads through its arrangements with various third parties, including Bass Pro and Choice Hotels. If these arrangements do not generate a sufficient number of leads or if these arrangements are terminated or limited and not replaced by other sources of sales prospects and leads, Bluegreen may not be able to successfully market and sell its products and services to new customers at current sales levels, at anticipated levels or at levels required in order to offset the costs associated with its marketing efforts. This would adversely impact Bluegreen\u2019s operating results and financial condition.\nBluegreen may not be successful in maintaining or expanding its capital-light business relationships, or its capital-light activities, including fee based sales and marketing arrangements, just-in-time VOI arrangements, and Secondary Market Sales activities, and such activities may not be profitable, which may have an adverse impact on Bluegreen\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nIn 2009, Bluegreen began offering fee-based marketing, sales, resort management and other services to third-party developers. Since that time, Bluegreen has continued to expand its capital-light business strategy, which Bluegreen believes enables it to leverage its expertise in sales and marketing, resort management, mortgage servicing, construction management and title services. Bluegreen currently intends for its capital-light business activities to become an increasing portion of its business over time as such activities generally produce positive cash flow and typically require less capital investment than Bluegreen\u2019s traditional vacation ownership business. Bluegreen has attempted to structure these activities to cover its costs and generate a profit. Sales of third party developers' VOIs must generate sufficient cash to comply with the terms of the developers' financing obligations as well as to pay the fees or commissions due Bluegreen. The third party developers may not be able to obtain or maintain financing necessary to meet the developer\u2019s requirements, which could impact Bluegreen's ability to sell the developers' inventory. While Bluegreen could attempt to utilize other arrangements, including just-in-time arrangements, where Bluegreen would utilize its receivable credit facilities in order to provide fee-based marketing and sales services, this would reduce the credit otherwise available to Bluegreen. Bluegreen commenced its capital-light activities largely during the recession in response to poor economic conditions and Bluegreen\u2019s fee-based and other capital-light business activities in the future may be adversely impacted by changes in economic conditions. While Bluegreen performs fee-based sales and marketing services, Bluegreen sells VOIs in a resort developed by a third party as an interest in the Bluegreen Vacation Club. This subjects Bluegreen to a number of risks typically associated with selling products developed by others under its own brand name, including litigation risks. Additionally, demand for the third party resorts may be below Bluegreen\u2019s expectations.\nBluegreen also sells VOI inventory through Secondary Market arrangements which require low levels of capital deployment. In connection with Secondary Market Sales, Bluegreen acquires VOI inventory from its resorts\u2019 POAs on a non-committed basis in close proximity to the timing of when Bluegreen intends to sell such VOIs. VOIs purchased from POAs are typically obtained by the POAs through foreclosure in connection with maintenance fee defaults and are generally acquired by Bluegreen at a discount. While Bluegreen intends to increase its Secondary Market Sales efforts in the future, Bluegreen may not be successful in doing so, and these efforts may not result in Bluegreen achieving anticipated results. Further Bluegreen\u2019s Secondary Market Sale activities may subject Bluegreen to negative publicity, which could adversely impact Bluegreen\u2019s reputation and business.\nBluegreen\u2019s results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely impacted if Bluegreen does not continue to participate in exchange networks and other strategic alliances with third parties or if Bluegreen\u2019s customers are not satisfied with the networks in which Bluegreen participates or Bluegreen\u2019s strategic alliances.\nBluegreen believes that its participation in exchange networks and other strategic alliances and its Traveler Plus\u2122 program make ownership of Bluegreen VOIs more attractive by providing owners with the ability to take advantage of vacation experiences in addition to stays at Bluegreen\u2019s resorts. A VOI owner\u2019s participation in the RCI exchange network allows an owner to exchange their annual VOI for occupancy at over 4,500 participating resorts, based upon availability and the payment of a variable exchange fee. During 2015, approximately 9% of Bluegreen owners utilized the RCI exchange network for an exchange of two or more nights. Bluegreen also has a strategic arrangement with Choice Hotels pursuant to which, subject to payments and conditions, certain of Bluegreen\u2019s resorts have been branded as part of Choice Hotels\u2019 Ascend Resort Collection\u00ae and Ascend Hotel Collection\u00ae. In\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\naddition, Bluegreen\u2019s Traveler Plus\u2122 members have the ability to convert their Bluegreen Vacation Club points into Choice Privileges\u00ae points which can be used for stays at participating Choice Hotels or may convert their Bluegreen Vacation Club points to stay at Ascend Collection\u00ae hotels. In addition, all Bluegreen Vacation Club members may convert their Bluegreen Vacation Club points for Choice Privileges\u00ae points for a fee. Bluegreen Vacation Club members, for an additional annual fee, may also participate in the Bluegreen Traveler Plus\u2122 program which allows them to use their points for a variety of hotel stays, RV site stays within the \u201cCoast to Coast\" network, or various cruise vacations. Also, for a nominal fee, Bluegreen Vacation Club owners who purchased or upgraded their VOI since July 1, 2007 and participate in the Bluegreen Traveler Plus\u2122 program have the ability to use their vacation points to reserve accommodations in 42 additional resort locations through Direct Exchange. Bluegreen may not be able to or desire to continue to participate in the RCI or Direct Exchange networks in the future. In addition, these networks and Bluegreen\u2019s Traveler Plus\u2122 program may not continue to operate effectively, and Bluegreen\u2019s customers may not be satisfied with them. Further, Bluegreen\u2019s relationship with Choice Hotels may not be well received by Bluegreen\u2019s customers or otherwise result in the benefits Bluegreen expects to derive from the relationship. In addition, Bluegreen may not be successful in identifying or entering into new strategic relationships in the future. If any of these events should occur, Bluegreen\u2019s results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely impacted.\nThe resale market for VOIs could adversely affect Bluegreen\u2019s business.\nBased on Bluegreen\u2019s experience at its resorts and at resorts owned by third parties, Bluegreen believes that resales of VOIs in the secondary market generally are made at net sales prices below the original customer purchase prices. The relatively lower sales prices are partly attributable to the high marketing and sales costs associated with the initial sales of such VOIs. Accordingly, the initial purchase of a VOI may be less attractive to prospective buyers and Bluegreen competes with buyers who seek to resell their VOIs. While VOI resale clearing houses or brokers currently do not have a material impact on Bluegreen\u2019s business, the availability of resale VOIs at lower prices, particularly if an organized and liquid secondary market develops, could adversely affect Bluegreen\u2019s level of sales and sales prices, which in turn would adversely affect Bluegreen\u2019s results of operations.\nBluegreen is subject to the risks of the real estate market and the risks associated with real estate development, including a decline in real estate values and a deterioration of other conditions relating to the real estate market and real estate development.\nReal estate markets are cyclical in nature and highly sensitive to changes in national and regional economic conditions, including:\n\u00b7\nlevels of unemployment;\n\u00b7\nlevels of discretionary disposable income;\n\u00b7\nlevels of consumer confidence;\n\u00b7\nthe availability of financing;\n\u00b7\noverbuilding or decreases in demand;\n\u00b7\ninterest rates; and\n\u00b7\nfederal, state and local taxation methods.\nDeterioration in general economic conditions or in the real estate market would have a material adverse effect on Bluegreen\u2019s business.\nTo the extent Bluegreen decides to acquire more real estate inventory in the future, the availability of land for development of resort properties at favorable prices at that time will be critical to Bluegreen\u2019s profitability and the ability to cover its significant selling, general and administrative expenses, cost of capital and other expenses. If Bluegreen is unable to acquire such land or resort properties at a favorable cost, Bluegreen\u2019s results of operations may be materially, adversely impacted. The profitability of Bluegreen\u2019s real estate development activities is also impacted by the cost of construction materials and services. Should the cost of construction materials and services rise, the ultimate cost of Bluegreen\u2019s future resorts inventory when developed could increase and have a material, adverse impact on Bluegreen\u2019s results of operations.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nAdverse outcomes in legal or other regulatory proceedings, including claims for development-related defects, could adversely affect Bluegreen\u2019s financial condition and operating results.\nIn the ordinary course of business, Bluegreen is subject to litigation and other, legal and regulatory proceedings, which result in significant expenses and devotion of time. In addition, litigation is inherently uncertain and adverse outcomes in the litigation and other proceedings to which Bluegreen is subject could adversely affect its financial condition and operating results.\nBluegreen engages third-party contractors to construct its resorts. Bluegreen also historically engaged third-party contractors to develop the communities within its former Bluegreen Communities business. However, Bluegreen\u2019s customers may assert claims against Bluegreen for construction defects or other perceived development defects, including, without limitation, structural integrity, the presence of mold as a result of leaks or other defects, water intrusion, asbestos, electrical issues, plumbing issues, road construction, water and sewer defects and defects in the engineering of amenities. In addition, certain state and local laws may impose liability on property developers with respect to development defects discovered in the future. Bluegreen could have to accrue a significant portion of the cost to repair such defects in the quarter when such defects arise or when the repair costs are reasonably estimable. In addition, liabilities related to Bluegreen Communities that were not assumed by Southstar Development Partners, Inc. (\u201cSouthstar\u201d) in connection with its purchase of substantially all of the assets which comprised Bluegreen Communities on May 4, 2012, including those relating to Bluegreen Communities\u2019 operations prior to the closing of the transaction, remain Bluegreen\u2019s responsibility.\nSee \u201cItem 3 - Legal Proceedings\u201d for a description of currently pending legal matters with respect to Bluegreen. Costs associated with litigation, including claims for development-related defects, and the outcomes thereof could adversely affect Bluegreen\u2019s liquidity, financial condition and operating results.\nBluegreen may be adversely affected by extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations and changes in applicable laws and regulations, including with respect to the imposition of additional taxes on operations. In addition, results of audits of Bluegreen\u2019s tax returns or those of Bluegreen\u2019s subsidiaries may have a material adverse impact on Bluegreen\u2019s financial condition.\nThe federal government and the states and local jurisdictions in which Bluegreen operates have enacted extensive regulations that affect the manner in which Bluegreen markets and sells VOIs and conducts its other business operations. In addition, many states have adopted specific laws and regulations regarding the sale of VOIs. Many states, including Florida and South Carolina, where certain of Bluegreen\u2019s resorts are located, extensively regulate the creation and management of timeshare resorts, the marketing and sale of timeshare properties, the escrow of purchaser funds prior to the completion of construction and closing, the content and use of advertising materials and promotional offers, the delivery of an offering memorandum and the creation and operation of exchange programs and multi-site timeshare plan reservation systems. Moreover, with regard to sales conducted in South Carolina, the closing of real estate and mortgage loan transactions must be conducted under the supervision of an attorney licensed in South Carolina and otherwise in accordance with South Carolina\u2019s Time Sharing Transaction Procedures Act. Most states also have other laws that are applicable to Bluegreen\u2019s activities, such as timeshare project registration laws, real estate licensure laws, mortgage licensure laws, sellers of travel licensure laws, anti-fraud laws, consumer protection laws, telemarketing laws, prize, gift and sweepstakes laws, and consumer credit laws. Bluegreen's management of, and dealings with, POAs, including Bluegreen's purchase of defaulted inventory from POAs in connection with its Secondary Market Sales, is also subject to state laws and resort rules and regulations, including those with respect to the establishment of budgets and expenditures, rule-making, and the imposition of maintenance assessments.\nBluegreen currently is authorized to market and sell VOIs in all locations at which its marketing and sales are conducted. If Bluegreen\u2019s agents or employees violate applicable regulations or licensing requirements, their acts or omissions could cause the states where the violations occurred to revoke or refuse to renew Bluegreen\u2019s licenses, render Bluegreen\u2019s sales contracts void or voidable, or impose fines on Bluegreen based on past activities.\nFurther, the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau, created under the Dodd-Frank Act, has emphasized new regulatory focus on areas of Bluegreen\u2019s business such as consumer mortgage servicing and debt collection, credit reporting and consumer financial disclosures, all of which affect the manner in which Bluegreen provides purchase money financing to the purchasers of its VOIs and conducts its lending and loan servicing operations.\nIn addition, the federal government and the states and local jurisdictions in which Bluegreen conducts business have generally enacted extensive regulations relating to direct marketing and telemarketing, including the federal\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\ngovernment\u2019s national \u201cDo Not Call\u201d list, and the making of marketing and related calls to cell phone users, a significant development in light of cell phone usage rapidly becoming the primary method of communication. The regulations have impacted Bluegreen\u2019s marketing of VOIs, and Bluegreen has taken steps to ensure compliance with these new regulations. However, these steps have increased and are expected to continue to increase Bluegreen\u2019s marketing costs. Bluegreen cannot predict the impact that these legislative initiatives or any other legislative measures that may be proposed or enacted in the future may have on Bluegreen\u2019s marketing strategies and results. Further, from time to time, complaints are filed against Bluegreen by individuals claiming that they received calls in violation of applicable regulations.\nCurrently, most states have taxed VOIs as real estate, imposing property taxes that are billed to the respective POAs that maintain the related resorts and have not sought to impose sales tax upon the sale of the VOI or accommodations tax upon the use of the VOI. From time to time, however, various states have attempted to promulgate new laws or apply existing laws impacting the taxation of VOIs to require that sales or accommodations taxes be collected. Should new state or local laws be implemented or interpreted to impose sales or accommodations taxes on VOIs, Bluegreen\u2019s business could be materially adversely affected.\nFrom time to time, consumers file complaints against Bluegreen in the ordinary course of Bluegreen\u2019s business. Bluegreen could be required to incur significant costs to resolve these complaints or enter into consents with regulators regarding its activities. Bluegreen may not remain in compliance with all applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations, and violations of applicable laws may have adverse implications on Bluegreen, including negative public relations, potential litigation and regulatory sanctions. The expense, negative publicity and potential sanctions associated with any failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on Bluegreen\u2019s results of operations or financial position.\nIn addition, VOIs may in the future be deemed to be securities under federal or state law and therefore subject to applicable securities regulation, which could have a material adverse effect on Bluegreen due to, among other things, the cost of compliance with such regulations.\nEnvironmental liabilities, including claims with respect to mold or hazardous or toxic substances, could have a material adverse impact on Bluegreen\u2019s financial condition and operating results.\nUnder various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, as well as common law, Bluegreen may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances, including mold, located on, in or emanating from property that Bluegreen owns, leases or operates, as well as related costs of investigation and property damage at such property. These laws often impose liability without regard to whether Bluegreen knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances. The presence of such substances, or the failure to properly remediate such substances, may adversely affect Bluegreen\u2019s ability to sell or lease its property or to borrow money using such property or receivables generated from the sale of such property as collateral. Noncompliance with environmental, health or safety requirements may require Bluegreen to cease or alter operations at one or more of its properties. Further, Bluegreen may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from violations of environmental regulations or from contamination associated with one or more of Bluegreen\u2019s properties.\nA failure to maintain the integrity of internal or customer data could result in damage to Bluegreen's reputation and subject Bluegreen to costs, fines, or lawsuits.\nBluegreen's operations and activities require the collection and retention of large volumes of internal and customer data, including credit card numbers and other personally identifiable information of Bluegreen's customers and employees. The integrity and protection of that customer, employee and company data is critical to Bluegreen. If that data is inaccurate or incomplete, Bluegreen could make faulty decisions. Bluegreen's customers and employees also have a high expectation that Bluegreen will adequately protect their personal information. The information, security and privacy requirements imposed by governmental regulation are increasingly demanding. Bluegreen's systems may not be able to satisfy these changing requirements and employee and customer expectations, or may require significant additional investments or time in order to do so. Efforts to hack or breach security measures, failures of systems or software to operate as designed or intended, viruses, operator error, or inadvertent releases of data all threaten Bluegreen's information systems and records. Bluegreen's reliance on computer, Internet-based and mobile systems and communications and the frequency and sophistication of efforts by hackers to gain unauthorized access to such systems have increased significantly in recent years. A significant theft, loss, or fraudulent use of customer, employee, or company data could adversely impact Bluegreen's reputation and could result in remedial\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nand other expenses, fines, or litigation and could have a material adverse impact on Bluegreen\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nBluegreen\u2019s technology requires updating and the failure to keep pace with developments in technology could impair Bluegreen's operations or competitive position.\nThe vacation ownership and hospitality industries require the utilization of technology and systems, including technology utilized for sales and marketing, mortgage servicing, property management, brand assurance and compliance, and reservation systems. This technology requires continuous updating and refinements, including technology required to remain competitive and to comply with the legal requirements such as privacy regulations and requirements established by third parties. Bluegreen intends to update its information technology platform, which has required, and is likely to continue to require, significant capital expenditures. Older systems which have not yet been updated may increase the risk of operational inefficiencies, financial loss and non-compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements and Bluegreen may not be successful in updating such systems in the time frame or at the cost anticipated. Further, as a result of the rapidly changing technological environment, systems which Bluegreen has put in place or expects to put in place in the near term may become outdated requiring new technology, and Bluegreen may not be able to replace those systems as quickly as its competition or within budgeted costs and time frames. Further, Bluegreen may not achieve the benefits that may have been anticipated from any new technology or system.\nThe loss of the services of Bluegreen\u2019s key management and personnel could adversely affect its business.\nBluegreen\u2019s ability to successfully implement its business strategy will depend on its ability to attract and retain experienced and knowledgeable management and other professional staff, and Bluegreen may not be successful in doing so. If Bluegreen's efforts to retain and attract key management and other personnel are unsuccessful, Bluegreen's business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely impacted. Bluegreen\u2019s Chief Executive Officer resigned in May 2015 and no permanent replacement has been appointed. In addition, in December 2015, Alan B. Levan resigned as Chairman of Bluegreen, with John E. Abdo, Bluegreen\u2019s Vice Chairman since May 2002, being appointed to succeed Mr. Levan as Bluegreen\u2019s Chairman.\nSince 2010, Bluegreen\u2019s Executive Committee has provided leadership and strategic direction to Bluegreen. In May 2015, Anthony M. Puleo, Chief Financial Officer of Bluegreen, was named Chairman of Bluegreen\u2019s Executive Committee. The other members of Bluegreen\u2019s Executive Committee include Bluegreen\u2019s Chief Strategy Officer, President of National Sales and Marketing, Senior Vice President of Corporate Marketing, Senior Vice President of Planning and Business Analytics, Chief Human Resources Officer, Chief Information Officer and General Counsel. There can be no assurance that this management structure will continue to be effective or that future changes to this structure, if any, would not have an adverse impact on Bluegreen.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nRisks Related to BBX Capital\nBBX Capital\u2019s business and operations and the mix of its assets significantly changed as a result of the sale of BankAtlantic to BB&T during July 2012, and its financial condition and results of operations depend on the monetization of its assets at or near their current book values and its results of operations will depend on the success of its investments.\nAs a result of the BB&T transaction, BBX Capital\u2019s business and operations significantly changed from its business and operations prior to the sale of BankAtlantic. As a consequence, BBX Capital\u2019s financial condition and results of operations will be dependent on its ability to successfully manage and monetize legacy assets and on the results of operations of Bluegreen and Bluegreen\u2019s ability to continue to pay dividends to Woodbridge and in turn Woodbridge\u2019s payment of dividends to BBX Capital. Further, BBX Capital\u2019s loan portfolio and real estate may not be easily salable in the event BBX Capital decides to liquidate an asset through a sale transaction. BBX Capital\u2019s financial condition and results of operations will be dependent in the long term on the success of its investments. If the legacy assets are not monetized at or near the current book values ascribed to them, or if these assets are liquidated for amounts less than book value, BBX Capital\u2019s financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected, and its ability to successfully pursue its business goals could be adversely affected. Because a majority of its assets do not generate income on a regular basis, BBX Capital does not expect to generate significant revenue or income with respect to these assets until such time as an asset is monetized through repayments or it consummates transactions involving the sale, joint venture or development of the underlying real estate or investments. Accordingly, BBX Capital expects its revenues and results of operations to vary significantly on a quarterly basis and from year to year.\nBBX Capital\u2019s future acquisitions may reduce earnings, require it to obtain additional financing and expose it to additional risks.\nBBX Capital\u2019s business strategy includes investments in or acquisitions of operating companies, such as its acquisitions of Renin Corp. and the acquisitions of businesses by BBX Sweet Holdings in the candy and confections industry. Some of these investments and acquisitions may be material. While BBX Capital is seeking investments and acquisitions primarily in companies that provide opportunities for growth, it may not be successful in identifying these opportunities. Investments or acquisitions that it completes may not prove to be successful or even if successful may not initially generate income, or may generate income on an irregular basis or over a long time period. Accordingly BBX Capital\u2019s results of operations may vary significantly on a quarterly basis and from year to year. Acquisitions may result in additional risks and may have a material adverse effect on BBX Capital\u2019s results of operations. Acquisitions entail numerous risks, including:\n\u00b7\nDifficulties in integrating and assimilating acquired management and operations;\n\u00b7\nRisks associated with achieving profitability;\n\u00b7\nThe incurrence of significant due diligence expenses relating to acquisitions that are not completed;\n\u00b7\nUnforeseen expenses and losses;\n\u00b7\nRisks associated with entering new markets in which it has no or limited prior experience;\n\u00b7\nThe potential loss of key employees or founders of acquired organizations; and\n\u00b7\nRisks associated with transferred assets and liabilities.\nBBX Capital may not be able to acquire or profitably manage additional businesses, or to integrate successfully any acquired businesses, including Renin and the businesses BBX Sweet Holdings acquired, without substantial costs, delays or other operational or financial difficulties, including difficulties in integrating information systems and personnel and establishing control environment processes across acquired businesses. The failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, to the extent that operating businesses are acquired outside the United States or the State of Florida, there will be additional risks related to compliance with foreign regulations and laws including tax laws, labor laws, currency fluctuations and geography economic conditions.\nIn addition, BBX Capital faces competition in making investments or acquisitions which could increase the costs associated with the investment or acquisition. Further, investments or acquisitions may rely on additional debt or equity financing. The issuance of debt will result in additional leverage which could limit its operating flexibility, and the issuance of equity could result in additional dilution to its shareholders. In addition, such financing could\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nconsist of equity securities which have rights, preferences or privileges senior to BBX Capital\u2019s Class A Common Stock.\nIf BBX Capital requires additional financing in the future, the financing may not be available when needed or on favorable terms, if at all. Additionally, shareholder approval will not be sought in connection with any investments or acquisitions unless required by law or regulation.\nSome of BBX Capital\u2019s operations are through unconsolidated joint ventures with unaffiliated third parties and BBX Capital may be adversely impacted by a joint venture partner\u2019s failure to fulfill its obligations.\nBy entering into joint ventures, BBX Capital can reduce the amount invested in the ownership and development of real estate properties. However, joint venture partners may become financially unable or unwilling to fulfill their obligations under the joint venture agreements. Most joint ventures borrow money to help finance their activities, and although recourse on the loans is generally limited to the managing members, joint ventures and their properties, BBX Capital has in some cases and may in the future provide ongoing financial support or guarantees. If joint venture partners do not meet their obligations to the joint venture, BBX Capital may be required to make significant expenditures which may have an adverse effect on its operating results or financial condition.\nInvestments in real estate developments directly or through joint ventures expose it to market and economic risks inherent in the real estate construction and development industry.\nThe real estate construction and development industry is highly competitive and subject to numerous risks which in many cases are beyond management\u2019s control. The success of BBX Capital\u2019s investments in real estate developments is dependent on many factors, including:\n\u00b7\nDemand for or oversupply of new homes, rental apartments and commercial real estate;\n\u00b7\nDemand for commercial real estate tenants;\n\u00b7\nReal estate market values;\n\u00b7\nChanges in capitalization rates impacting real estate values;\n\u00b7\nInventory of foreclosed homes negatively impacting selling prices;\n\u00b7\nAvailability and reasonable pricing of skilled labor;\n\u00b7\nAvailability and reasonable pricing of construction materials such as lumber, framing, concrete and other building materials;\n\u00b7\nChanges in laws and regulations for new construction and land entitlements, including environmental and zoning laws and regulations;\n\u00b7\nNatural disasters and severe weather conditions increasing costs, delaying construction, causing uninsured losses or reducing demand for new homes;\n\u00b7\nAvailability and cost of mortgage financing for potential purchasers;\n\u00b7\nMortgage loan interest rates;\n\u00b7\nAvailability, delays and costs associated with obtaining permits, approvals or licenses necessary to develop property;\n\u00b7\nConstruction defects and product liability claims and;\n\u00b7\nGeneral economic conditions.\nAny of these factors could give rise to delays in the start or completion of a project, or increase the cost of developing a project, or could result in reduced prices and values for BBX Capital\u2019s developments, including developments underlying its joint venture investments.\nA significant portion of BBX Capital\u2019s assets are located in Florida and economic conditions in the Florida real estate market could adversely affect BBX Capital\u2019s earnings and financial condition.\nThe legacy assets retained by BBX Capital in the BB&T Transaction and the real estate investments made by BBX Capital are primarily in the Florida market, and adverse changes to the Florida economy or the real estate market may negatively impact BBX Capital\u2019s earnings and financial condition. BBX Capital\u2019s business, the primary source of repayment for loans and the real estate collateralizing loans and real estate acquired through foreclosure or settlements with borrowers and its investments in real estate joint ventures are primarily concentrated in Florida. As a result, BBX Capital is exposed to geographic risks of high unemployment rates, declines in the housing industry and declines in the real estate market in Florida. Adverse changes in laws and regulations in Florida would have a negative impact on BBX Capital\u2019s revenues, financial condition and business. Declines in the Florida housing\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nmarkets may negatively impact the credit performance of BBX Capital\u2019s loans and result in significant asset impairments. Further, the State of Florida is subject to the risks of natural disasters such as tropical storms and hurricanes, which may disrupt BBX Capital\u2019s operations, adversely impact the ability of its borrowers to timely repay their loans, adversely impact the value of any collateral securing loans and BBX Capital\u2019s portfolio of real estate (both held-for-sale and held-for-investment), or otherwise have an adverse effect on BBX Capital\u2019s results of operations. The severity and impact of tropical storms, hurricanes and other weather related events are unpredictable.\nAn increase in BBX Capital\u2019s allowance for loan losses will result in reduced earnings.\nBBX Capital continues to be exposed to the risk that borrowers will be unable to repay their loans according to their terms and that any collateral securing the payment of these loans will not be sufficient to assure full repayment. Management evaluates the collectibility of the loan portfolio and provides an allowance for loan losses that it believes is adequate based upon such factors as:\n\u00b7\nthe risk characteristics of various classifications of loans;\n\u00b7\nprevious loan loss experience;\n\u00b7\ndelinquency trends;\n\u00b7\nestimated fair value of the collateral; and\n\u00b7\ncurrent economic conditions.\nMany of these factors are difficult to predict or estimate accurately, particularly in a changing economic environment. The process of determining the estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio requires subjective and complex judgments and the level of uncertainty concerning economic conditions may adversely affect the ability to estimate the losses which may be incurred in the loan portfolio. If such evaluation is incorrect and borrowers\u2019 defaults result in losses exceeding the portion of the allowance for loan losses allocated to those loans, or if perceived adverse trends requires significant increases in the allowance for loan losses in the future, BBX Capital\u2019s earnings could be significantly and adversely affected.\nNon-accrual loans take significant time to resolve and adversely affect BBX Capital\u2019s results of operations and financial condition, and could result in further losses in the future.\nAt December 31, 2015, non-accrual loans totaled approximately $17.4 million or 72% of BBX Capital\u2019s total loan portfolio. Non-accrual loans adversely affect net income through foreclosure costs, operating expenses and taxes. Until these loans are monetized, BBX Capital may incur additional losses relating to these non-accrual loans. BBX Capital records interest income on non-accrual loans on a cash basis. When BBX Capital receives the collateral in foreclosures or similar proceedings, BBX Capital is required to mark the related collateral to the then fair market value, generally based on appraisals of the property. These loans also increase BBX Capital\u2019s risk profile, and increases in the level of non-accrual loans adversely affect BBX Capital\u2019s results of operations and financial condition. While BBX Capital seeks to manage non-accrual loans, decreases in the value of these loans or deterioration in the financial condition of borrowers, which is often impacted by economic and market conditions beyond BBX Capital\u2019s control, could adversely affect BBX Capital\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the resolution of non-accrual loans requires significant commitments of management time.\nBBX Capital\u2019s consumer loan portfolio is concentrated in home equity loans collateralized by properties located in South Florida.\nFinancial institutions and other lenders have tightened underwriting standards which has limited the ability of borrowers to refinance. The majority of BBX Capital\u2019s home equity loans are residential second mortgages that exhibit higher loss severity than residential first mortgages. If home prices decline, BBX Capital may experience higher credit losses from this loan portfolio. Since the collateral for this portfolio consists primarily of second mortgages, it is unlikely that BBX Capital will be successful in recovering all or any portion of BBX Capital\u2019s loan proceeds in the event of a default unless BBX Capital is prepared to repay the first mortgage and such repayment and the costs associated with a foreclosure are justified by the value of the property.\nThe cost and outcome of pending legal proceedings may impact BBX Capital\u2019s results of operations.\nBBX Capital is involved in ongoing litigation which has resulted in significant selling, general and administrative expenses relating to legal and other professional fees. Pending proceedings include litigation brought by the SEC, litigation arising out of workouts and foreclosures, and legal proceedings associated with BankAtlantic\u2019s tax\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\ncertificate business. As discussed under Item 3. Legal Proceedings, the jury in the SEC action found that BBX Capital and BBX Capital\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Alan B. Levan had engaged in an act of fraud or deceit toward shareholders or prospective investors by making materially false statements knowingly or with severe recklessness (1) with respect to three statements in a July 25, 2007 conference call and (2) failing to classify certain loans as held-for sale in the 2007 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The jury also found that Mr. Levan made or caused to be made false statements to the independent accountants regarding the held for sale issue. BBX Capital and Mr. Levan have appealed the adverse judgment to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. While the results of appellate review are uncertain legal and related costs are being incurred in connection with the appeal. BBX Capital received legal fee and cost reimbursements from its insurance carrier in connection with the SEC action of approximately $5.8 million as of December 31, 2015 and the insurance carrier has indicated it may seek reimbursement for costs, charges and expenses advanced in connection with this matter. If BBX Capital is required to reimburse the insurance carrier, such reimbursements would adversely impact BBX Capital\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. See Item 3 - Legal Proceedings for additional information.\nAdverse market conditions may affect BBX Capital\u2019s business and results of operations.\nBBX Capital\u2019s financial condition and results of operations may be adversely impacted as a result of any downturn in the U.S. housing and commercial real estate markets and general economic conditions. Negative market and economic developments may cause increases in delinquencies and default rates of BBX Capital\u2019s loans and may impact charge-offs and provisions for loan losses and the value of BBX Capital\u2019s real estate and other real estate related assets.\nRenin sales are concentrated with two significant customers and there is significant competition in the industry.\nA significant amount of Renin\u2019s sales are to big-box home centers. These home centers in many instances have significant negotiating leverage with their vendors, and are able to affect the prices Renin receives for its products and the terms and conditions on which Renin conducts its business with them. These home centers may also reduce the number of vendors they purchase from or make significant changes in their volume of purchases. Although homebuilders, dealers and other retailers represent other channels of distribution for Renin\u2019s products, the loss of a home center customer or reduced sales volume from any of these home centers would have a material adverse effect on Renin\u2019s business. Further, Renin has substantial competition from overseas manufacturers of products similar to those sold by Renin.\nA significant portion of Renin\u2019s business relies on home improvement and new home construction activity, both of which are cyclical and outside of management\u2019s control.\nA significant portion of Renin\u2019s business in Canada and the United States is dependent on the levels of home improvement activity, including spending on repair and remodeling projects, and new home construction activity. Macroeconomic conditions including consumer confidence levels, fluctuations in home prices, unemployment and underemployment levels, interest rates, regulatory initiatives, and the availability of home equity loans and mortgage financing affect both discretionary spending on home improvement projects as well as new home construction activity. Adverse changes in these factors or uncertainty regarding these macroeconomic conditions could result in a decline in spending on home improvement projects and a decline in demand for new home construction, both of which could adversely affect Renin\u2019s results of operations.\nThe operating results of Renin and BBX Sweet Holdings would be negatively impacted if they experience increased commodity costs or a limited availability of commodities.\nBBX Capital\u2019s operating businesses purchase various commodities to manufacture products, including steel, aluminum, glass and mirror in the case of Renin, and sugar and cocoa in the case of BBX Sweet Holdings. Fluctuations in the availability and prices of these commodities could increase the cost to manufacture products. Further, increases in energy costs could increase production costs as well as transportation costs, each of which could negatively affect these businesses operating results. Renin\u2019s and BBX Sweet Holdings\u2019 existing arrangements with customers, competitive considerations and the relative negotiating power and resistance of home center customers and big-box retailers to price increases make it difficult to increase selling prices to absorb increased production costs. If Renin and BBX Sweet Holdings are not able to increase the prices of its products or achieve other cost savings or productivity improvements to offset any increased commodity and production costs, BBX Capital\u2019s operating results could be negatively impacted.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nUnexpected events, such as natural disasters, severe weather and terrorist activities may disrupt Renin\u2019s operations and increase its production costs.\nThe occurrence of one or more unexpected events, including tsunamis, hurricanes, earthquakes, floods and other forms of severe weather or terrorist activities in countries or regions in which Renin\u2019s suppliers are located could adversely affect Renin\u2019s operations and financial performance. Natural disasters, acts or threats of war or terrorism, or other unexpected events could result in temporary or long-term disruption in the delivery or supply of necessary raw materials and component products from Renin\u2019s suppliers, which would disrupt Renin\u2019s production capabilities and likely increase its cost of doing business.\nMarket demand for chocolate and candy products could decline.\nBBX Sweet Holdings and its acquired businesses operate in highly competitive markets and compete with larger companies that have greater resources. The success of these businesses is impacted by many factors, including the following:\n\u00b7\nEffective retail execution;\n\u00b7\nEffective and cost efficient advertising campaigns and marketing programs;\n\u00b7\nAdequate supply of commodities at a reasonable cost;\n\u00b7\nOversight of product safety;\n\u00b7\nAbility to sell manufactured products at competitive prices;\n\u00b7\nResponse to changes in consumer preferences and tastes; and\n\u00b7\nChanges in consumer health concerns, including obesity and the consumption of certain ingredients.\nA decline in market demand for chocolate and candy products could negatively affect operating results.\nBBX Sweet Holdings product recall or product liability claims could have a material and adverse effect.\nSelling products for human consumption involves inherent legal and other risks, including product contamination, spoilage, product tampering, allergens, or other adulteration. BBX Sweet Holdings could decide or be required to destroy inventory, recall products or lose sales in connection with contamination, tampering, adulteration or other deficiencies. These events could result in significant losses and may damage BBX Sweet Holdings\u2019 reputation, and discourage consumers from buying products, or cause production and delivery disruptions which would adversely affect BBX Sweet Holdings\u2019 financial condition and results of operations. BBX Sweet Holdings may also incur losses if products cause injury, illness or death. A significant product liability claim may adversely affect both reputation and profitability, even if the claim is unsuccessful.\nBBX Capital\u2019s financial performance may adversely affect its ability to access capital and may have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBBX Capital\u2019s ability to fund operations and investment opportunities may depend on its ability to raise capital in the secondary markets and on its ability to monetize its portfolio of non-accruing loans and foreclosed real estate. Its ability to raise additional capital will depend on, among other things, conditions in the financial markets at the time, which are outside of BBX Capital\u2019s control, as well as litigation and its financial condition, results of operations and prospects. The failure to obtain capital may have a material adverse effect on BBX Capital\u2019s results of operation and financial condition.\nBBX Capital is controlled by BFC and its controlling shareholders, and this control position may adversely affect the market price of BBX Capital\u2019s Class A Common Stock.\nBFC currently owns 13,321,441 shares of BBX Capital\u2019s Class A Common Stock, representing approximately 81% of the outstanding shares of such stock and all 195,045 outstanding shares of BBX Capital\u2019s Class B Common Stock representing approximately 90% of BBX Capital\u2019s total voting power. Additionally, Alan B. Levan and John E. Abdo, Vice Chairman of BBX Capital and BFC, collectively beneficially own shares of BFC\u2019s Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock representing approximately 63% of BFC\u2019s total voting power. BBX Capital\u2019s Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock vote as a single group on most matters. Accordingly, BFC, directly, and Messrs. Levan and Abdo, indirectly through BFC, are in a position to control BBX Capital, elect BBX\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nCapital\u2019s board of directors and significantly influence the outcome of any shareholder vote. This control position may have an adverse effect on the market price of BBX Capital\u2019s Class A Common Stock.\nBFC can reduce its economic interest in BBX Capital and still maintain voting control.\nBBX Capital\u2019s Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock generally vote together as a single class, with the Class A Common Stock possessing a fixed 53% of the aggregate voting power of BBX Capital, and the Class B Common Stock possessing a fixed 47% of such aggregate voting power. BBX Capital\u2019s Class B Common Stock currently represents less than 1% of BBX Capital\u2019s total common equity and 47% of BBX Capital\u2019s total voting power. As a result, the voting power of BBX Capital\u2019s Class B Common Stock does not bear a direct relationship to the economic interest represented by the shares.\nAny issuance of shares of Class A Common Stock will further dilute the relative economic interest of the Class B Common Stock, but will not decrease the voting power represented by the Class B Common Stock. Further, BBX Capital\u2019s Restated Articles of Incorporation provide that these relative voting percentages will remain fixed until such time as BFC and its affiliates own less than 97,253 shares of the Class B Common Stock, which is approximately 50% of the number of shares of Class B Common Stock that BFC now owns, even if additional shares of Class A Common Stock are issued. Therefore, BFC may sell up to approximately 50% of its shares of Class B Common Stock (after converting those shares to shares of Class A Common Stock), and significantly reduce its economic interest in BBX Capital, while still maintaining its voting power. If BFC were to take this action, it would widen the disparity between the equity interest represented by the Class B Common Stock and its voting power. Any conversion of shares of Class B Common Stock into shares of Class A Common Stock would further dilute the voting interests of the holders of the Class A Common Stock.\nProvisions in BBX Capital\u2019s Restated Articles of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws, and recently adopted shareholder rights plan, may make it difficult for a third party to acquire BBX Capital and could depress the price of BBX Capital\u2019s Class A Common Stock.\nBBX Capital\u2019s Restated Articles of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws contain provisions that could delay, defer or prevent a change of control of BBX Capital or its management. These provisions could make it more difficult for shareholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. As a result, these provisions could limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of BBX Capital\u2019s Class A Common Stock. These provisions include:\n\u00b7\nthe provisions in the Restated Articles of Incorporation regarding the voting rights of Class B Common Stock;\n\u00b7\nthe authority of the board of directors to issue additional shares of common or preferred stock and to fix the relative rights and preferences of the preferred stock without additional shareholder approval; and\n\u00b7\nadvance notice procedures to be complied with by shareholders in order to make shareholder proposals or nominate directors.\nIn addition, on February 7, 2013, BBX Capital adopted a shareholder rights plan which is designed to preserve certain tax benefits available to BBX Capital. However, because the rights plan provides a deterrent to investors from acquiring a 5% or greater ownership interest in Class A Common Stock, it may have an anti-takeover effect.\nThe loss of key personnel or the failure to attract and retain highly qualified personnel could adversely affect BBX Capital\u2019s operations.\nBBX Capital\u2019s performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of skilled individuals. BBX Capital\u2019s business operations could be adversely affected if BBX Capital is unable to retain and motivate BBX Capital\u2019s existing employees and attract new employees as needed. In addition, as previously described, the jury in the SEC action found that BBX Capital and Alan B. Levan committed violations of federal securities laws. While BBX Capital and Mr. Levan appealed the adverse judgment to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, the results of appellate review are uncertain. Mr. Alan Levan resigned as BBX Capital\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer on December 23, 2015. BBX Capital believes that Mr. Abdo, who serves as a director and Vice Chairman of BBX Capital and Jarett Levan, the Board appointed acting Chairman and Chief Executive Officer will mitigate the loss of Mr. Alan Levan as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.", "PERMNO": 89735, "SIC": 6035, "TIC": "BBX"}
