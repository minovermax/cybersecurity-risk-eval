{"cik": "879526", "company": "WABASH NATIONAL CORP /DE", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-27", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to other information contained or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report before investing in our securities. Realization of any of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business, Strategy and Operations\nOur business is highly cyclical, which has had, and could have further, adverse effects on our sales and results of operations.\nThe truck trailer manufacturing industry historically has been and is expected to continue to be cyclical, as well as affected by overall economic conditions. Customers historically have replaced trailers in cycles that run from five to 12 years, depending on service and trailer type. Poor economic conditions can adversely affect demand for new trailers and have historically, and has currently, led to an overall aging of trailer fleets beyond a typical replacement cycle. Customers\u2019 buying patterns can also be influenced by regulatory changes, such as federal hours-of-service rules as well as overall truck safety and federal emissions standards.\nThe steps we have taken to diversify our product offerings through the implementation of our strategic plan do not insulate us from this cyclicality. During downturns, we operate with a lower level of backlog and have had to temporarily slow down or halt production at some or all of our facilities, including extending normal shut down periods and reducing salaried headcount levels. An economic downturn may reduce, and in the past has reduced, demand for trailers, resulting in lower sales volumes, lower prices and decreased profits or losses.\nDemand for new trailers has been and will continue to be sensitive to economic conditions over which we have no control and that may adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nDemand for trailers is sensitive to changes in economic conditions such as the level of employment, consumer confidence, consumer income, new housing starts, government regulations and the availability of financing and interest rates. The status of these economic conditions periodically have an adverse effect on truck freight and the demand for and the pricing of our trailers, and have also resulted in, and could continue to result in, the inability of customers to meet their contractual terms or payment obligations, which could cause our operating revenues and profits to decline.\nWe may not be able to execute on our long-term strategic plan and growth initiatives, or meet our long-term financial goals.\nOur long-term strategic plan is intended to generate long-term value for our shareholders by transforming Wabash National into a diversified industrial manufacturer while delivering profitable growth through all our business segments. The long-term financial goals that we expect to achieve as a result of our long-term strategic plan and organic growth initiatives are based on certain assumptions, which may prove to be incorrect. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to fully execute on our strategic plan or growth initiatives, which are subject to a variety of risks, including, but not limited to, our ability to: diversify the product offerings of our non-trailer businesses; leverage acquired businesses and assets to grow sales with our existing products; design and develop new products to meet the needs of our customers; increase the pricing of our products and services to offset cost increases and expand gross margins; and execute potential future acquisitions, mergers, and other business development opportunities. If we are unable to successfully execute on our strategic plan, we may experience increased competition, adverse financial consequences and a decrease in the value of our stock. Additionally, our management\u2019s attention to the implementation of the strategic plan may distract them from implementing our core business which may also have adverse financial consequences.\nWe have a limited number of suppliers of raw materials and components; increases in the price of raw materials or the inability to obtain raw materials could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe currently rely on a limited number of suppliers for certain key components and raw materials in the manufacturing of our products, such as tires, landing gear, axles, suspensions and specialty steel coil used in DuraPlate\u00ae panels. From time to time, there have been and may in the future be shortages of supplies of raw materials or components, or our suppliers may place us on allocation, which would have an adverse impact on our ability to meet demand for our products. Shortages and allocations may result in inefficient operations and a build-up of inventory, which can negatively affect our working capital position. In addition, price volatility in commodities we purchase which impact the pricing of raw materials could have negative impacts on our operating margins. The loss of any of our suppliers or their inability to meet our price, quality, quantity and delivery requirements could have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations.\nGlobal economic weakness could negatively impact our operations and financial performance.\nWhile the trailer industry has recently experienced a period of economic recovery, we cannot provide any assurances that we will be profitable in future periods or that we will be able to sustain or increase profitability in the future. Increasing our profitability will depend on several factors, including, but not limited to, our ability to increase our overall trailer volumes, improve our gross margins, gain continued momentum on our product diversification efforts and manage our expenses. If we are unable to generate profitability in the future, we may not be able to meet our payment and other obligations under our outstanding debt agreements.\nWe continue to be reliant on the credit, housing and construction-related markets in the U.S. The same general economic concerns faced by us are also faced by our customers. We believe that some of our customers are highly leveraged, have limited access to capital, and their continued existence may be reliant on liquidity from global credit markets and other sources of external financing. Lack of liquidity by our customers could impact our ability to collect amounts owed to us. While we have taken steps to address these concerns through the implementation of our strategic plan, we are not immune to the pressures being faced by our industry or the global economy, and our results of operations may decline.\nA change in our customer relationships or in the financial condition of our customers has had, and could have further, adverse effects on our business.\nWe have longstanding relationships with a number of large customers to whom we supply our products. We do not have long-term agreements with these customers. Our success is dependent, to a significant extent, upon the continued strength of these relationships and the growth of our core customers. We often are unable to predict the level of demand for our products from these customers, or the timing of their orders. In addition, the same economic conditions that adversely affect us also often adversely affect our customers. Furthermore, we are subject to a concentration of risk as the five largest customers together accounted for approximately 20% of our aggregate net sales and there have been customers historically who have individually accounted for greater than 10% of our aggregate net sales. The loss of a significant customer or unexpected delays in product purchases could further adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur backlog is not necessarily indicative of the level of our future revenues.\nOur backlog represents future production for which we have written orders from our customers that can be produced or sold in the next 18 months. Orders that comprise our backlog may be subject to changes in quantities, delivery, specifications and terms, or cancellation, and our reported backlog may not be converted to revenue in any particular period and actual revenue from such orders may not equal our backlog. Therefore, our backlog is not necessarily indicative of the level of our future revenues.\nInternational operations are subject to increased risks, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur ability to manage our business and conduct operations internationally requires considerable management attention and resources and is subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022 challenges caused by distance, language and cultural differences and by doing business with foreign agencies and governments;\n\u2022 longer payment cycles in some countries;\n\u2022 uncertainty regarding liability for services and content;\n\u2022 credit risk and higher levels of payment fraud;\n\u2022 currency exchange rate fluctuations and our ability to manage these fluctuations;\n\u2022 foreign exchange controls that might prevent us from repatriating cash earned outside the U.S.;\n\u2022 import and export requirements that may prevent us from shipping products or providing services to a particular market and may increase our operating costs;\n\u2022 potentially adverse tax consequences;\n\u2022 higher costs associated with doing business internationally;\n\u2022 different expectations regarding working hours, work culture and work-related benefits; and\n\u2022 different employee/employer relationships and the existence of workers\u2019 councils and labor unions.\nCompliance with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to international operations may increase our cost of doing business and could expose us or our employees to fines, penalties and other liabilities. These numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include import and export requirements, content requirements, trade restrictions, tax laws, environmental laws and regulations, sanctions, internal and disclosure control rules, data privacy requirements, labor relations laws, U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and substantially equivalent local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials and/or other foreign persons. Although we have policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our officers, employees, contractors or agents will not violate our policies. Any violation of the laws and regulations that apply to our operations and properties could result in, among other consequences, fines, environmental and other liabilities, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services to one or more countries and could also materially damage our reputation, our brand, our efforts to diversify our business, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business and our operating results.\nOur technology and products may not achieve market acceptance or competing products could gain market share, which could adversely affect our competitive position.\nWe continue to optimize and expand our product offerings to meet our customer needs through our established brands, such as DuraPlate\u00ae, DuraPlateHD\u00ae, DuraPlate\u00ae XD-35\u00ae, DuraPlate Aeroskirt\u00ae, FreightPro\u00ae, ArcticLite\u00ae, Transcraft\u00ae, Eagle\u00ae, Benson\u00ae, Walker Stainless Equipment, Brenner\u00ae Tank, Garsite, Progress Tank, TST\u00ae, Bulk Tank International, and Extract Technology\u00ae. While we target product development to meet customer needs, there is no assurance that our product development efforts will be embraced and that we will meet our sales projections. Companies in the truck transportation industry, a very fluid industry in which our customers primarily operate, make frequent changes to maximize their operations and profits.\nOver the past several years, we have seen a number of our competitors follow our leadership in the development and use of composite sidewalls that bring them into direct competition with our DuraPlate\u00ae products. Our product development is focused on maintaining our leadership for these products but competitive pressures may erode our market share or margins. We hold patents on various components and techniques utilized in our manufacturing of transportation equipment and engineered products with expiration dates ranging from 2015 to 2030. We continue to take steps to protect our proprietary rights in our products and the processes used to produce them. However, the steps we have taken may not be sufficient or may not be enforced by a court of law. If we are unable to protect our intellectual properties, other parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain or use our products or technology. If competitors are able to use our technology, our ability to effectively compete could be harmed. In addition, litigation related to intellectual property could result in substantial costs and efforts which may not result in a successful outcome.\nDisruption of our manufacturing operations would have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe manufacture our van trailer products at two facilities in Lafayette, Indiana, a flatbed and dump-body trailer facility in Cadiz, Kentucky, a hardwood floor facility in Harrison, Arkansas, six liquid-transportation systems facilities in New Lisbon, Wisconsin; Fond du Lac, Wisconsin; Kansas City, Missouri; Kansas City, Kansas; Portland, Oregon; and Queretaro, Mexico and three engineered products facilities in New Lisbon, Wisconsin; Elroy, Wisconsin; and Huddersfield, United Kingdom. An unexpected disruption in our production at any of these facilities for any length of time would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe inability to attract and retain key personnel could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur ability to operate our business and implement our strategies depends, in part, on the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees. Our future success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, including manufacturing personnel, sales professionals and engineers. The unexpected loss of services of any of our key personnel or the failure to attract or retain other qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on the operation of our business.\nWe rely significantly on information technology to support our operations and if we are unable to protect against service interruptions or security breaches, our business could be adversely impacted.\nWe depend on a number of information technologies to integrate departments and functions, to enhance the ability to service customers, to improve our control environment and to manage our cost reduction initiatives. We have put in place a number of systems, processes, and practices designed to protect against the failure of our systems, as well as the misappropriation, exposure or corruption of the information stored thereon. Unintentional service disruptions or intentional actions such as intellectual property theft, cyber-attacks, unauthorized access or malicious software, may lead to such misappropriation, exposure or corruption if our protective measures prove to be inadequate. Any issues involving these critical business applications and infrastructure may adversely impact our ability to manage operations and the customers we serve. We could also encounter violations of applicable law or reputational damage from the disclosure of confidential business, customer, or employee information or the failure to protect the privacy rights of our employees in their personal identifying information. In addition, the disclosure of non-public information could lead to the loss of our intellectual property and diminished competitive advantages. Should any of the foregoing events occur, we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future.\nSignificant competition in the industries in which we operate may result in our competitors offering new or better products and services or lower prices, which could result in a loss of customers and a decrease in our revenues.\nThe industries in which we participate are highly competitive. We compete with other manufacturers of varying sizes, some of which have substantial financial resources. Trailer manufacturers compete primarily on the quality of their products, customer relationships, service availability and price. Barriers to entry in the standard truck trailer manufacturing industry are low. As a result, it is possible that additional competitors could enter the market at any time. In the recent past, manufacturing over-capacity and high leverage of some of our competitors, along with bankruptcies and financial stresses that affected the industry, contributed to significant pricing pressures.\nIf we are unable to successfully compete with other trailer manufacturers, we could lose customers and our revenues may decline. In addition, competitive pressures in the industry may affect the market prices of our new and used equipment, which, in turn, may adversely affect our sales margins and results of operations.\nWe are subject to extensive governmental laws and regulations, and our costs related to compliance with, or our failure to comply with, existing or future laws and regulations could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe length, height, width, maximum weight capacity and other specifications of truck and tank trailers are regulated by individual states. The federal government also regulates certain trailer safety features, such as lamps, reflective devices, tires, air-brake systems and rear-impact guards. In addition, most tank trailers we manufacture have specific federal regulations and restrictions that dictate tank design, material type and thickness. Changes or anticipation of changes in these regulations can have a material impact on our financial results, as our customers may defer purchasing decisions and we may have to re-engineer products. We are subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the transportation, storage, presence, use, disposal and handling of hazardous materials, discharge of storm water and underground fuel storage tanks and may be subject to liability associated with operations of prior owners of acquired property. In addition, we are subject to laws and regulations relating to the employment of our associates and labor-related practices.\nIf we are found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations in the future, it could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our costs of complying with these or any other current or future regulations may be material. In addition, if we fail to comply with existing or future laws and regulations, we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions.\nNew regulations related to conflict-free minerals may force us to incur additional expenses and otherwise adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nAs mandated by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted rules regarding disclosure of the use of certain minerals, known as conflict minerals, originating from the Democratic Republic of Congo or adjoining countries. These new requirements require ongoing due diligence efforts, with initial disclosure requirements made in May 2014. We may incur significant costs to determine the source of any such minerals used in our products. We may also incur costs with respect to potential changes to products, processes or sources of supply as a consequence of our diligence activities. Further, the implementation of these rules and their effect on customer and/or supplier behavior could adversely affect the sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in our products, as the number of suppliers offering conflict-free minerals could be limited. We may incur additional costs or face regulatory scrutiny if we determine that some of our products contain materials not determined to be conflict-free or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of all conflict minerals used in our products. Accordingly, the implementation of these rules could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and/or financial condition.\nProduct liability and other legal claims could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAs a manufacturer of products widely used in commerce, we are subject to product liability claims and litigation, as well as warranty claims. From time to time claims may involve material amounts and novel legal theories, and any insurance we carry may not provide adequate coverage to insulate us from material liabilities for these claims.\nIn addition to product liability claims, we are subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, such as workers' compensation claims, OSHA investigations, employment disputes and customer and supplier disputes arising out of the conduct of our business. Litigation may result in substantial costs and may divert management's attention and resources from the operation of our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. As described in more detail in \u201cItem 3 - Legal Proceedings\u201d below, we are currently appealing a judgment rendered by the Fourth Civil Court of Curitiba, Brazil, in a lawsuit that has been pending since 2001. While we are appealing this judgment, which renders it unenforceable at this time, and the Brazilian Court of Appeals has the authority to render a new judgment in the case without any regard to the lower court\u2019s findings, the ultimate outcome of the case is uncertain and the resolution of this litigation may result in us incurring substantial costs that are not covered by insurance.\nAn impairment in the carrying value of goodwill and other long-lived intangible assets could negatively affect our operating results.\nWe have a substantial amount of goodwill and purchased intangible assets on our balance sheet as a result of acquisitions. At December 31, 2014, approximately 90% of these long-lived intangible assets were concentrated in our Diversified Products segment. The carrying value of goodwill represents the fair value of an acquired business in excess of identifiable assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date. The carrying value of other long-lived intangible assets represents the fair value of trademarks and trade names, customer relationships and technology as of the acquisition date, net of any accumulated amortization. Under generally accepted accounting principles, goodwill is required to be reviewed for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if potential interim indicators exist that could result in impairment, and other long-lived intangible assets require review for impairment only when indicators exist. If any business conditions or other factors cause profitability or cash flows to significantly decline, we may be required to record a non-cash impairment charge, which could adversely affect our operating results. Events and conditions that could result in impairment include a prolonged period of global economic weakness, a further decline in economic conditions or a slow, weak economic recovery, sustained declines in the price of our common stock, adverse changes in the regulatory environment, adverse changes in the market share of our products, adverse changes in interest rates, or other factors leading to reductions in the long-term sales or profitability that we expect.\nThe full utilization of our remaining U.S. federal income tax net operating loss carryforwards has significantly increased, and will continue to significantly increase, our cash tax payments and may adversely impact our ability to fund operations.\nDuring 2014 we utilized all of our remaining U.S. Federal income tax net operating loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards and, therefore, experienced an increase in our cash tax payments in 2014 as compared to previous years. We anticipate further increases in our tax payments in 2015, which could limit the amount of liquidity available to fund working capital, capital expenditures or other strategic initiatives.\nOur ability to fund operations is limited by our cash on hand and available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility.\nWe believe our liquidity, defined as cash on hand and available borrowing capacity, on December 31, 2014 of $289.9 million and our expected continued improvements in profitability will be more than adequate to fund working capital requirements and capital expenditures throughout 2015, which we expect to be a period of continued strong demand within the trailer manufacturing industry. Furthermore, we continue to have the option, subject to certain conditions, to request an additional incremental increase to the total commitment of our revolving credit facility of $50 million. Our liquidity position as of December 31, 2014 represented an increase of $35.6 million and $65.6 million from December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Our ability to fund our working capital needs and capital expenditures is limited by the net cash provided by operations, cash on hand and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Declines in net cash provided by operations, increases in working capital requirements necessitated by an increased demand for our products and services, further decreases in the availability under the revolving credit facility or changes in the credit our suppliers provide to us, could rapidly exhaust our liquidity.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nOur levels of indebtedness could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt agreements.\nOur debt and debt service obligations increased significantly in 2012 as a result of the offering of our 3.375% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2018 (\u201cNotes\u201d) in April 2012, entering into the Term Loan Credit Agreement in May 2012, which was subsequently amended in May 2013, and the amendment and restatement of our revolving credit agreement. As of December 31, 2014, and as a result of these events, we had $352 million of indebtedness, including: $193 million secured debt, $150 million unsecured debt, $7 million in capital lease obligations and $2 million in an industrial revenue bond. This level of debt could have significant consequences on our future operations, including, among others:\n\u2022 making it more difficult for us to meet our payment and other obligations under our outstanding debt agreements;\n\u2022 resulting in an event of default if we fail to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in our debt agreements, which event of default could result in all of our debt becoming immediately due and payable;\n\u2022 reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes, and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes;\n\u2022 subjecting us to the risk of increased sensitivity to interest rate increases on our indebtedness with variable interest rates;\n\u2022 limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, and increasing our vulnerability to, changes in our business, the industry in which we operate and the general economy; and\n\u2022 placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or are less leveraged.\nAny of the factors listed above could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt agreements.\nServicing our debt will require a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our debt obligations.\nOur ability to make scheduled principal payments of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance, which is subject to regulatory, economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. While we do not have significant scheduled principal payments until 2018, our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations.\nDespite our current debt levels, we may still incur substantially more debt or take other actions that would intensify the risks discussed above.\nDespite our current consolidated debt levels, we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional debt in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in our debt instruments, some of which may be secured debt. We are not restricted under the terms of the indenture governing the Notes from incurring additional debt, securing existing or future debt, recapitalizing our debt or taking a number of other actions that are not limited by the terms of the indenture governing the Notes. Our Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement restricts our ability to incur additional indebtedness, including secured indebtedness, but if the facilities mature or are repaid, we may not be subject to such restrictions under the terms of any subsequent indebtedness.\nThe conditional conversion feature of the Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nIn the event the conditional conversion feature of the Notes is triggered, holders of Notes will be entitled to convert the Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their Notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than cash in lieu of any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our working capital.\nFuture sales of our common stock in the public market could lower the market price for our common stock.\nIn the future, we may sell additional shares of our common stock to raise capital. In addition, a substantial number of shares of our common stock are reserved for issuance upon the exercise of stock options and upon conversion of the Notes. We cannot predict the size of future issuances or the effect, if any, that they may have on the market price for our common stock. The issuance and sale of substantial amounts of common stock, or the perception that such issuances and sales may occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities.\nProvisions of the Notes could discourage a potential future acquisition of us by a third party.\nCertain provisions of the Notes could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us. Upon the occurrence of certain transactions constituting a fundamental change, holders of the Notes will have the right, at their option, to require us to repurchase all of their Notes or any portion of the principal amount of such Notes in integral multiples of $1,000. We also may be required to issue additional shares upon conversion in the event of certain corporate transactions. In addition, the indenture for the Notes prohibits us from engaging in certain mergers or acquisitions unless, among other things, the surviving entity assumes our obligations under the Notes. These and other provisions of the Notes could prevent or deter a third party from acquiring us even where the acquisition could be beneficial to our stockholders.\nOur Term Loan Credit Agreement, as amended, and revolving credit facility contain restrictive covenants that, if breached, could limit our financial and operating flexibility and subject us to other risks.\nOur Term Loan Credit Agreement, as amended, and revolving credit facility include certain financial covenants. Breaching those financial covenants would trigger an event of default and our lenders may, subject to various customary cure rights, require the immediate payment of all amounts outstanding and foreclose on the collateral.\nThese debt facilities contain customary covenants limiting our ability to, among other things, pay cash dividends, incur debt or liens, redeem or repurchase stock, enter into transactions with affiliates, merge, dissolve, repay subordinated indebtedness, make investments and dispose of assets. As required under our Term Loan Credit Agreement, as amended, we must maintain a maximum senior secured leverage ratio tested as of the last day of each fiscal quarter for the four consecutive fiscal quarters then ending of not more than (A) 4.5 to 1.0 through September 30, 2013, (B) 4.0 to 1.0 thereafter through September 30, 2015, and (C) 3.5 to 1.0 thereafter. In addition, under our revolving credit facility, we are required to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.1 to 1.0 as of the end of any period of 12 fiscal months when excess availability under the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement is less than 12.5% of the total revolving commitment. As of December 31, 2014, our senior secured leverage ratio was 0.3:1.0, and in compliance with all covenants under the Term Loan Credit Agreement, as amended.\nIf availability under the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement is less than 15% of the total revolving commitment or if there exists an event of default, amounts in any of the Borrowers\u2019 and the Revolver Guarantors\u2019 deposit accounts (other than certain excluded accounts) will be transferred daily into a blocked account held by the Revolver Agent and applied to reduce the outstanding amounts under the facility.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we were in compliance with all covenants under both our Term Loan Credit Agreement, as amended, and our revolving credit facility. Our ability to comply with the various financial covenants in the future may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions.\nRisks Related to an Investment in Our Common Stock\nOur common stock has experienced, and may continue to experience, price and trading volume volatility.\nThe trading price and volume of our common stock has been and may continue to be subject to large fluctuations. The market price and volume of our common stock may increase or decrease in response to a number of events and factors, including:\n\u00b7 trends in our industry and the markets in which we operate;\n\u00b7 changes in the market price of the products we sell;\n\u00b7 the introduction of new technologies or products by us or by our competitors;\n\u00b7 changes in expectations as to our future financial performance, including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors;\n\u00b7 operating results that vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors;\n\u00b7 announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, financings or capital commitments;\n\u00b7 actions by significant or activist shareholders, including those who through proxy solicitations, shareholder proposals, public campaigns or otherwise may seek to effect changes or acquire control of the Company or who may seek to increase short-term shareholder value;\n\u00b7 changes in laws and regulations;\n\u00b7 general economic and competitive conditions; and\n\u00b7 changes in key management personnel.\nAlso, shareholders may from time to time engage in proxy solicitations, advance shareholder proposals or otherwise attempt to effect changes or acquire control over the Company. Such shareholder campaigns could disrupt the Company\u2019s operations and divert the attention of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors and senior management and employees from the pursuit of business strategies and adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nThis volatility may adversely affect the prices of our common stock regardless of our operating performance. To the extent that the price of our common stock declines, our ability to raise funds through the issuance of equity or otherwise use our common stock as consideration will be reduced. These factors may limit our ability to implement our operating and growth plans.", "PERMNO": 77117, "SIC": 3715, "TIC": "WNC"}
