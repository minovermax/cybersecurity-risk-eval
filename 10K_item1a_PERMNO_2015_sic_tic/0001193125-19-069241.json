RISK FACTORS.\nWe operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks, some of which are beyond our control. The following discussion highlights some of the risks that may affect our future operating results. These are the risks and uncertainties that we believe are the most important for you to consider, but the risks described below are not the only risks facing our company. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, that we currently deem immaterial, or that are similar to those faced by other companies in our industry or in business in general, may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks or uncertainties occurs, continues, or worsens, our business, financial condition, and operating results would likely suffer. You should carefully consider the risks described below together with the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have grown significantly in recent years, and our delinquency, credit loss rates, and overall results of operations may be adversely affected if we do not manage our growth effectively.\nWe have experienced substantial growth in recent years, opening a net 8 branches in 2016, a net 3 branches in 2017, and a net 17 branches in 2018, and increasing the size of our finance receivable portfolio from $628.4 million at the beginning of 2016 to $932.2 million at the end of 2018, a compound annual growth rate of 14.0%. We intend to continue our growth strategy in the future. As we increase the number of branches we operate, we will be required to find new, or relocate existing, employees to operate our branches and allocate resources to train and supervise those employees. The success of a branch depends significantly on the manager overseeing its operations and on our ability to enforce our underwriting standards and implement controls over branch operations. Recruiting suitable managers for new branches can be challenging, particularly in remote areas and in areas where we face significant competition. Furthermore, the annual turnover rate among our branch managers was approximately 21% in 2017 and 22% in 2018, and turnover rates of managers in our new branches may be similar or higher. Increasing the number of branches that we operate may divide the attention of our senior management or strain our ability to adapt our infrastructure and systems to accommodate our growth. If we are unable to promote, relocate, or recruit suitable managers, oversee their activities effectively, maintain our underwriting and loan servicing standards, and otherwise appropriately and effectively staff our branches, our delinquency and credit loss rates may increase and our overall results of operations may be adversely impacted.\nWe face significant risks in implementing our growth strategy, some of which are outside of our control.\nWe intend to continue our growth strategy, which is based on opening and acquiring branches in existing and new markets, introducing new products and channels, and increasing the finance receivable portfolios of our existing branches. Our ability to execute this growth strategy is subject to significant risks, some of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nthe inherent uncertainty regarding general economic conditions;\n\u2022\nthe prevailing laws and regulatory environment of each state in which we operate or seek to operate and federal laws and regulations, all of which are subject to change at any time;\n\u2022\nthe degree of competition in new markets and its effect on our ability to attract new customers;\n\u2022\nour ability to identify attractive locations for new branches;\n\u2022\nour ability to recruit qualified personnel, particularly in remote areas and in areas where we face a great deal of competition; and\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain adequate financing for our expansion plans.\nFor example, certain states into which we may expand limit the number of lending licenses granted. For instance, Georgia requires a \u201cconvenience and advantage\u201d assessment of a new lending license and location prior\nRegional Management Corp. | 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 16\nto the granting of the license. This assessment adds time and expense to opening new locations and creates risk that our state regulator will deny an application for a new lending license due to a perceived oversaturation of existing licensed lenders in the area in which we seek to expand and operate. There can be no assurance that if we apply for a license for a new branch, whether in one of the states where we currently operate or in a state into which we would like to expand, we will be granted a license to operate. We also cannot be certain that any such license, even if granted, would be obtained in a timely manner or without burdensome conditions or limitations. In addition, we may not be able to obtain and maintain the regulatory approvals, government permits, or licenses that may be required to operate.\nWe are exposed to credit risk in our lending activities.\nOur ability to collect on loans depends on the willingness and repayment ability of our borrowers. Any material adverse change in the effectiveness of our underwriting models, our implementation of such models (including through our loan origination software and processes), or the ability or willingness of a significant portion of our borrowers to meet their obligations to us, whether due to changes in general economic, political, or social conditions, the cost of consumer goods, interest rates, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism, or other causes over which we have no control, or to changes or events affecting our borrowers such as unemployment, major medical expenses, bankruptcy, divorce, or death, would have a material adverse impact on our earnings and financial condition. Further, a substantial majority of our borrowers are non-prime borrowers, who are more likely to be affected, and more severely affected, by adverse macroeconomic conditions. We cannot be certain that our credit administration personnel, policies, and procedures will adequately adapt to changes in economic or any other conditions affecting customers and the quality of the loan portfolio.\nOur convenience check strategy exposes us to certain risks.\nA significant portion of the growth in our installment loans has been achieved through direct mail campaigns. One aspect of our direct mail campaigns involves mailing \u201cconvenience checks\u201d to pre-screened recipients, which customers can sign and cash or deposit, thereby agreeing to the terms of the loan, which are disclosed on the front and back of the check and in the accompanying disclosures. We use convenience checks to seed new branch openings and to attract new customers to existing branches in our geographic footprint. In 2017 and 2018, loans initiated through convenience checks represented 17.2% and 19.2%, respectively, of the value of our originated loans. We expect that convenience checks will continue to represent a meaningful portion of our installment loan originations in the future. There are several risks associated with the use of convenience checks, including the following:\n\u2022\nit is more difficult to maintain sound underwriting standards with convenience check customers, and these customers have historically presented a higher risk of default than customers that originate loans in our branches, as we do not meet convenience check customers prior to soliciting them and extending a loan to them, and we may not be able to verify certain elements of their financial condition, including their current employment status, income, or life circumstances;\n\u2022\nwe rely on credit information from a third-party credit bureau that is more limited than a full credit report to pre-screen potential convenience check recipients, which may not be as effective as a full credit report or may be inaccurate or outdated;\n\u2022\nwe face limitations on the number of potential borrowers who meet our lending criteria within proximity to our branches;\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to continue to access the demographic and credit file information that we use to generate our mailing lists due to expanded regulatory or privacy restrictions;\n\u2022\nconvenience checks pose a risk of fraud;\n\u2022\nwe depend on one bank to issue and clear our convenience checks, and any failure by that bank to properly process the convenience checks could limit the ability of a recipient to cash the check and enter into a loan with us;\nRegional Management Corp. | 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 17\n\u2022\ncustomers may opt out of direct mail solicitations and solicitations based on their credit file or may otherwise prohibit us from soliciting them; and\n\u2022\npostal rates and production costs may continue to rise.\nIn the future, we could experience one or more of these issues associated with our direct mail strategy. Any increase in the use of convenience checks will further increase our exposure to, and the magnitude of, these risks.\nOur policies and procedures for underwriting, processing, and servicing loans are subject to potential failure or circumvention, which may adversely affect our results of operations.\nA substantial portion of our underwriting activities and our credit extension decisions are made at our local branches. We rely on certain inputs and verifications in the underwriting process to be performed by individual personnel at the branch level. In addition, pursuant to our operations policies and procedures, exceptions to general underwriting criteria can be approved by central underwriting employees and certain other senior employees. We train our employees individually onsite in the branch and through online training modules to make loans that conform to our underwriting standards. Such training includes critical aspects of state and federal regulatory compliance, cash handling, account management, and customer relations. Although we have standardized employee manuals and online training modules, we primarily rely on our district supervisors, with oversight by our state vice presidents, branch auditors, and headquarters personnel, to train and supervise our branch employees, rather than centralized training programs. Therefore, the quality of training and supervision may vary from district to district and branch to branch depending on the amount of time apportioned to training and supervision and individual interpretations of our operations policies and procedures. There can also be no assurance that we will be able to attract, train, and retain qualified personnel to perform the tasks that are part of the underwriting process. If the training and supervision of our personnel fails to be effective, or if we are unable to attract and retain qualified employees, it is possible that our underwriting criteria will be improperly applied to a greater percentage of loan applications. If such improper applications were to increase, delinquency and losses on our loan portfolio could increase.\nIn addition, we rely on certain third-party service providers in connection with loan underwriting and origination. Any error or failure by a third-party service provider in providing loan underwriting and origination services may cause us to originate loans to borrowers that do not meet our underwriting standards. Likewise, any failure or error by us in utilizing third-party software or services to implement our underwriting and origination criteria may cause us to originate loans to borrowers that do not meet our underwriting standards. We cannot be certain that every loan is made in accordance with our underwriting standards and rules. We have experienced instances of loans extended that varied from our underwriting standards. Variances in underwriting standards and lack of supervision could expose us to greater delinquencies and credit losses than we have historically experienced. Due to the decentralized nature in which the loan application process occurs, employee misconduct or error in the application or closing process could also result in the origination of loans that do not satisfy our underwriting standards, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with customers and counterparties, we rely heavily on information provided by customers, counterparties, and other third parties, including credit bureaus and data aggregators, and we further rely on representations of customers and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information. If a significant percentage of our customers were to intentionally or negligently misrepresent any of this information, or provide incomplete information, and our internal processes were to fail to detect such misrepresentations in a timely manner, or any or all of the other components of the underwriting process described above were to fail, we could end up approving a loan that, based on our underwriting criteria, we would not have otherwise made. As a result, our earnings and our financial condition could be negatively impacted.\nRegional Management Corp. | 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 18\nWe may be limited in our ability to collect on our loan portfolio, and the security interests securing a significant portion of our loan portfolio are not perfected, which may increase our credit losses.\nLegal and practical limitations may limit our ability to collect on our loan portfolio, resulting in increased credit losses, decreased revenues, and decreased earnings. State and federal laws and regulations restrict our collection efforts. The amounts that we are able to recover from the repossession and sale of collateral typically do not fully cover the outstanding loan balance and costs of recovery. In cases where we repossess a vehicle securing a loan, we generally sell our repossessed automobile inventory through sales conducted by independent automobile auction organizations after the required post-repossession waiting period. In certain instances, we may sell repossessed collateral other than vehicles through our branches after the required post-repossession waiting period and appropriate receipt of valid bids. In either case, such sales are made consistent with applicable state law. The proceeds we receive from such sales depend upon various factors, including the supply of, and demand for, used vehicles and other property at the time of sale. During periods of economic slowdown or recession, there may be less demand for used vehicles and other property that we desire to resell.\nMost of our loan portfolio is secured, but a significant portion of such security interests have not been and will not be perfected, which means that we cannot be certain that such security interests will be given first priority over other creditors. The lack of perfected security interests is one of several factors that may make it more difficult for us to collect on our loan portfolio. Additionally, for those of our loans that are unsecured, borrowers may choose to repay obligations under other indebtedness before repaying loans to us because such borrowers may feel that they have no collateral at risk. In addition, given the relatively small size of our loans, the costs of collecting loans may be high relative to the amount of the loan. As a result, many collection practices that are legally available, such as litigation, may be financially impracticable. Lastly, there is an inherent risk that a portion of the retail installment contracts that we hold will be subject to certain claims or defenses that the borrower may assert against the originator of the contract and, by extension, us as the holder of the contract. These factors may increase our credit losses, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur insurance operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties.\nWe market and sell optional credit life, accident and health, personal property, involuntary unemployment, and vehicle single interest insurance to our borrowers in selected markets as an agent for an unaffiliated third-party insurance company. In addition, on certain loans, we collect a fee from our customers and in turn purchase non-file insurance from an unaffiliated insurance company for our benefit in lieu of recording and perfecting our security interest in personal property collateral. The unaffiliated insurance company cedes to our wholly-owned insurance subsidiary, RMC Reinsurance, Ltd., the net insurance premium revenue and the associated insurance claims liability for all insurance products, including the non-file insurance that we purchase.\nWhen purchased by a borrower, the optional credit insurance products benefit the borrower by insuring the borrower\u2019s payment obligations on the associated loan in the event of the borrower\u2019s inability to make monthly payments due to death, disability, or involuntary unemployment, or in the event of a casualty event associated with collateral. Payment of the associated premiums can be made by the borrower separately, but except in very rare instances, the borrower finances payment of the premium, with the financed premium included in the balance of the loan. A credit insurance product may be cancelled if, for example, (i) we request cancellation due to the borrower\u2019s default on obligations under the associated loan, (ii) the borrower prepays the principal balance of the associated loan in full, or (iii) the borrower elects to terminate the credit insurance prior to the expiration of the term thereof (which the borrower may do at any time). Generally, upon any cancellation of credit insurance, the borrower will be entitled to a refund of the unearned premium for the cancelled insurance. We typically refund insurance premiums by reducing the principal balance of the associated loan by the required refund amount, following which the unaffiliated insurance company reimburses us for the refunded amount.\nOur insurance operations are subject to a number of material risks and uncertainties, including changes in laws and regulations, borrower demand for insurance products, claims experience, and insurance carrier\nRegional Management Corp. | 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 19\nrelationships. Changes to laws or regulations may, for example, negatively impact our ability to offer one or more of our insurance products or to purchase non-file insurance; the manner in which we are permitted to offer such products; capital and reserve requirements; the frequency and type of regulatory monitoring and reporting to which we are subject; benefits or loss ratio requirements; insurance producer licensing or appointment requirements; and reinsurance operations. In addition, because our borrowers are not required to purchase the credit insurance products that we offer, we cannot be certain that borrower demand for credit insurance products will not decrease in the future. In addition to adversely impacting our insurance income, net, any decrease in the demand for credit insurance products would negatively impact our interest and fee income because we finance substantially all of our borrowers\u2019 insurance premiums. Our insurance operations are also dependent on our lending operations as the sole source of business and product distribution. If our lending operations discontinue offering insurance products, our insurance operations would have no method of distribution. Insurance claims and policyholder liabilities are also difficult to predict and may exceed the related reserves set aside for claims and associated expenses for claims adjudication.\nWe are also dependent on the continued willingness of unaffiliated third-party insurance companies to participate in the credit insurance market and to offer non-file insurance to us. For example, in 2016, we transitioned our credit insurance business to a new unaffiliated third-party insurance company because the insurance company with which we previously had a relationship made a strategic decision to exit the credit insurance market altogether. While we were able to transition successfully to a new provider in 2016, we cannot be certain that the credit insurance market will remain viable in the future. Further, if our insurance provider is for any reason unable or unwilling to meet its claims and premium reimbursement payment obligations or its premium ceding obligations, we would experience increased net credit losses, regulatory scrutiny, litigation, and other losses and expenses.\nFinally, in recent years, as large loans have become a larger percentage of our portfolio, the severity of non-file insurance claims has increased and non-file insurance claims expenses have exceeded non-file insurance premiums by a material amount. The resulting net loss from the non-file insurance product is reflected in our insurance income, net. It is uncertain whether the non-file insurance product will be available to us in the future on the same terms as it is today, or at all. If the unaffiliated insurance company were to enforce limitations on our non-file loss ratios or otherwise change the terms under which it offers non-file insurance to us, our net credit losses, loss rates, and provision for credit losses could increase.\nIf any of these events, risks, or uncertainties were to occur or materialize, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations and cash flows.\nA reduction in demand for our products and a failure by us to adapt to such reduction could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe demand for the products we offer may be reduced due to a variety of factors, such as demographic patterns, changes in customer preferences or financial conditions, regulatory restrictions that decrease customer access to particular products, or the availability of competing products, including through alternative or competing marketing channels. For example, we are highly dependent upon selecting and maintaining attractive branch locations. These locations are subject to local market conditions, including the employment available in the area, housing costs, traffic patterns, crime, and other demographic influences, any of which may quickly change, thereby negatively impacting demand for our products in the area. Should we fail to adapt to significant changes in our customers\u2019 demand for, or access to, our products, our revenues could decrease significantly and our operations could be harmed. Even if we do make changes to existing products or introduce new products and channels to fulfill customer demand, customers may resist or may reject such products. Moreover, the effect of any product change on the results of our business may not be fully ascertainable until the change has been in effect for some time, and by that time it may be too late to make further modifications to such product without causing further harm to our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nRegional Management Corp. | 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 20\nWe face strong direct and indirect competition.\nThe consumer finance industry is highly competitive, and the barriers to entry for new competitors are relatively low in the markets in which we operate. We compete for customers, locations, employees, and other important aspects of our business with many other local, regional, national, and international financial institutions, many of which have greater financial resources than we do.\nOur installment loan operations compete with other installment lenders, as well as with alternative financial services providers (such as payday and title lenders, check advance companies, and pawnshops), online or peer-to-peer lenders, issuers of non-prime credit cards, and other competitors. We believe that regulatory developments in the consumer finance industry have caused and may in the future cause lenders that focus on alternative financial services to begin to offer installment loans. In addition, if companies in the installment loan business attempt to provide more attractive loan terms than is standard across the industry, we may lose customers to those competitors. With respect to installment loans, we compete primarily on the basis of price, breadth of loan product offerings, flexibility of loan terms offered, and the quality of customer service provided.\nOur retail purchase loan operations compete with non-prime retail lenders, store and third-party credit cards, prime lending sources, rent-to-own finance providers, and other competitors. We compete primarily on the basis of interest rates charged, the quality of credit accepted, the flexibility of loan terms offered, the speed of approval, and the quality of customer service provided.\nIf we fail to compete successfully, we could face lower sales and may decide or be compelled to materially alter our lending terms to our customers, which could result in decreased profitability.\nWe may attempt to pursue acquisitions or strategic alliances that may be unsuccessful.\nWe may attempt to achieve our business objectives through acquisitions and strategic alliances. We compete with other companies for these opportunities, including companies with greater financial resources, and we cannot be certain that we will be able to effect acquisitions or strategic alliances on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Furthermore, most acquisition targets that we have pursued previously have been significantly smaller than us. We do not have extensive experience with integrating larger acquisitions. In pursuing these transactions, we may experience, among other things:\n\u2022\novervaluing potential targets;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in integrating any acquired companies, branches, or products into our existing business, including integration of account data into our information systems;\n\u2022\ninability to realize the benefits we anticipate in a timely fashion, or at all;\n\u2022\nattrition of key personnel from acquired businesses;\n\u2022\nunexpected losses due to the acquisition of loan portfolios with loans originated using less stringent underwriting criteria;\n\u2022\nsignificant costs, charges, or write-downs; or\n\u2022\nunforeseen operating difficulties that require significant financial and managerial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development and expansion of our existing operations.\nGeographic concentration of our loan portfolio may increase the risk of loss.\nAny concentration of our loan portfolio in a state or region may present unique risk concentrations. Our branches in South Carolina, Texas, and North Carolina accounted for 18%, 32%, and 16%, respectively, of our finance receivables in 2018. Furthermore, all of our operations are in five Southeastern, three Southwestern, one Mid-Atlantic, and two Midwestern states. As a result, we are highly susceptible to adverse economic conditions\nRegional Management Corp. | 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 21\nin those areas. The unemployment and bankruptcy rates in some states in our footprint are among the highest in the country. High unemployment rates may reduce the number of qualified borrowers to whom we will extend loans, which would result in reduced loan originations. In addition, some geographic regions of the United States will, from time to time, experience weaker regional economic conditions and consequently will experience higher rates of loss and delinquency. A regional economy may be adversely affected by the loss of jobs in certain industries, by state and local taxes, or by other factors, including natural disasters, civil disturbances, or international events such as wars. In the event that a significant portion of our loan portfolio is comprised of loans owed by borrowers residing in certain jurisdictions where economic conditions, elevated bankruptcy filings, natural disasters, or other factors specific to these jurisdictions adversely impact the delinquency and default experience of our loan portfolio, we could experience reduced or delayed payments on outstanding loans. For example, in 2017 and 2018, we experienced increases in credit losses as a result of hurricanes impacting customer accounts in our geographic footprint. These losses occurred in states where a substantial majority of our loan portfolio is concentrated-specifically in Texas in 2017 and in South Carolina and North Carolina in 2018. Conversely, an improvement in economic conditions could result in prepayments by our borrowers of their payment obligations on our loans. As a result, we may receive principal payments on the outstanding loans earlier than anticipated, which would reduce our finance receivables and the interest income earned thereon. No prediction can be made and no assurance can be given as to the effect of economic conditions on the rate of delinquencies, prepayments, or losses on our loan portfolio with respect to any part of our geographic footprint.\nFurthermore, the concentration of our loan portfolio in one or more states would have a disproportionate effect on our business if governmental authorities in any of those states take action against us. In addition, the occurrence of any of the adverse regulatory or legislative events described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section in states with a high concentration of our loan portfolio could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. For example, if interest rates in South Carolina, which currently are not capped, were to be capped, our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected.\nFailure of third-party service providers upon which we rely could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on certain third-party service providers. In particular, we currently rely on one key vendor to print and mail our convenience check and other offers for our direct mail marketing campaigns, and on certain other third-party service providers in connection with loan underwriting, origination, and servicing. Our reliance on these and other third parties can expose us to risks. For example, an error by our current convenience check vendor in 2015 resulted in check offers being misdirected, requiring us in some cases to notify state regulators and to refund certain interest and fee amounts, and exposing us to increased credit risk. If any of our third-party service providers, including our direct mail vendor and those third parties providing services in connection with loan underwriting, origination, and servicing, are unable to provide their services timely, accurately, and effectively, or at all, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations and cash flows.\nWe rely on information technology products developed, owned, and supported by third parties. Our ability to manage our business and monitor results is highly dependent upon these information technology products. A failure of these products and systems or of the implementation of new information technology products and systems could disrupt our business.\nIn the operation of our business, we are highly dependent upon a variety of information technology products, including our loan management system, which allows us to record, document, and manage our loan portfolio. In April 2016, we entered into an agreement with Nortridge pursuant to which Nortridge provides us with loan management software and related services. In February 2018, we completed our transition to the Nortridge loan management software across our operations footprint.\nSince we began transitioning to the Nortridge platform, we have tailored it to meet our specific needs. To a certain extent, we depend on the willingness and ability of Nortridge to continue to provide customized solutions\nRegional Management Corp. | 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 22\nand to support our evolving products and business model. In the future, Nortridge may not be willing or able to provide the services necessary to meet our loan management system needs. If this occurs, we may be forced to migrate to an alternative software package, which could materially affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nFurther, the Nortridge platform may in the future fail to perform in a manner consistent with our current expectations and may be inadequate for our needs. As we are dependent upon our ability to gather and promptly transmit accurate information to key decision makers, our business, results of operations, and financial condition may be adversely affected if our loan management system does not allow us to transmit accurate information, even for a short period of time. Failure to properly or adequately address these issues could impact our ability to perform necessary business operations, which could adversely affect our competitive position, business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe also rely on Teledata Communications Inc. and other third-party software vendors to provide access to loan applications and/or screen applications. There can be no assurance that these third party providers will continue to provide us with information in accordance with our lending guidelines or that they will continue to provide us lending leads at all. If this occurs, our credit losses, business, results of operations, and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nFurther, the Nortridge platform and other third-party software vendor products and applications are subject to damage or interruption from:\n\u2022\npower loss, computer systems failures, and internet, telecommunications, or data network failures;\n\u2022\noperator negligence or improper operation by, or supervision of, employees;\n\u2022\nphysical and electronic loss of data or security breaches, misappropriation, and similar events;\n\u2022\ncomputer viruses;\n\u2022\ncyberterrorism;\n\u2022\nintentional acts of vandalism and similar events; and\n\u2022\nhurricanes, fires, floods, and other natural disasters.\nAny failure of the Nortridge platform or any other third-party software vendor product systems, if not addressed by our disaster recovery plan, could cause an interruption in operations. Though we have implemented contingency and disaster recovery processes in the event of one or several technology failures, any unforeseen failure, interruption, or compromise of these systems or security measures could affect the origination, servicing, and collection of loans. The risk of possible failures or interruptions may not be adequately addressed, and such failures or interruptions could occur.\nWe may not be able to make technological improvements as quickly as some of our competitors, which could harm our competitive ability and adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations, and financial condition.\nThe financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes, with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products, services, and marketing channels. We rely on our integrated branch network as the foundation of our multiple channel platform and the primary point of contact with our active accounts. However, to serve customers who want to reach us over the internet, we developed a new channel in late 2008 by making an online loan application available on our consumer website, and in 2017, we rolled out an online customer portal, which provides customers with online access to their account information and an electronic payment option. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demand for convenience, as well as\nRegional Management Corp. | 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 23\nto create additional efficiencies in our operations. We expect that new technologies and business processes applicable to the consumer finance industry will continue to emerge, and these new technologies and business processes may be more efficient than those that we currently use. We cannot ensure that we will be able to sustain our investment in new technology, and we may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services as quickly as some of our competitors or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could cause disruptions in our operations, harm our ability to compete with our competitors, and adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations, and financial condition.\nSecurity breaches, cyber-attacks, failures in our information systems, or fraudulent activity could result in damage to our operations or lead to reputational damage.\nWe rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business. Each branch is part of an information network that is designed to permit us to maintain adequate cash inventory, reconcile cash balances on a daily basis, and report revenues and expenses to our headquarters. Our computer systems, software, and networks may be vulnerable to breaches (including via computer hackings), unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses, or other failures or disruptions that could result in disruption to our business or the loss or theft of confidential information, including customer information. Any failure, interruption, or breach in security of these systems, including any failure of our back-up systems, hardware failures, or an inability to access data maintained offsite, could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management, general ledger, loan, and other systems and could result in a loss of data (including loan portfolio data), a loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation, possible financial liability, and other adverse consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, we may not be able to detect immediately any such breach, which may increase the losses that we would suffer. In addition, our existing insurance policies would not reimburse us for all of the damages that we might incur as a result of a breach.\nA security breach or cyber-attack on our computer systems could interrupt or damage our operations or harm our reputation. Despite the implementation of security measures, our systems may still be vulnerable to data theft, computer viruses, programming errors, attacks by third parties, or similar disruptive problems. If we were to experience a security breach or cyber-attack, we could be required to incur substantial costs and liabilities, including, among other things, the following:\n\u2022\nexpenses to rectify the consequences of the security breach or cyber-attack;\n\u2022\nliability for stolen assets or information;\n\u2022\ncosts of repairing damage to our systems;\n\u2022\nlost revenue and income resulting from any system downtime caused by such breach or attack;\n\u2022\nincreased costs of cyber security protection;\n\u2022\ncosts of incentives we may be required to offer to our customers or business partners to retain their business; and\n\u2022\ndamage to our reputation causing customers and investors to lose confidence in our company.\nFurther, any compromise of security or cyber-attack could deter consumers from entering into transactions that require them to provide confidential information to us. In addition, if confidential customer information or information belonging to our business partners is misappropriated from our computer systems, we could be sued by those who assert that we did not take adequate precautions to safeguard our systems and confidential data belonging to our customers or business partners, which could subject us to liability and result in significant legal fees and expenses in defending these claims. As a result, any compromise of security of our computer systems or cyber-attack could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, and financial condition.\nRegional Management Corp. | 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 24\nAs part of our business, and subject to applicable privacy laws, we may share confidential customer information and proprietary information with vendors, service providers, and business partners. The information systems of these third parties may also be vulnerable to security breaches, and we may not be able to ensure that these third parties have appropriate security controls in place to protect the information that we share with them. If our proprietary or confidential customer information is intercepted, stolen, misused, or mishandled while in possession of a third party, it could result in reputational harm to us, loss of customer business, and additional regulatory scrutiny, and it could expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and liquidity. Although we maintain insurance that is intended to cover certain losses from such events, there can be no assurance that such insurance will be adequate or available.\nOur centralized headquarters\u2019 functions and branch operations are susceptible to disruption by catastrophic events, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur headquarters are in an office building located in Greer, South Carolina, a town located outside of Greenville, South Carolina. Our information systems and administrative and management processes are primarily provided to our branches from this centralized location, and our separate data management facility is located in Greenville, South Carolina. These processes could be disrupted if a catastrophic event, such as a tornado, power outage, or act of terror, affected Greenville, Greer, or the nearby areas. Any such catastrophic event(s) or other unexpected disruption of our headquarters or data management facility could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in making, continuing, and growing relationships with retailers, or if the retailers with whom we have relationships experience a decline or disruption in their sales volumes.\nOur retail purchase loans are reliant on our relationships with retailers. Our retail purchase loan business model is based on our ability to enter into agreements with individual retailers to provide financing to customers in their stores. If a competitor were to offer better service or more attractive loan products to our retail partners, it is possible that our retail partners would terminate their relationships with us. If we are unable to continue to grow our existing relationships and develop new relationships, our results of operations, financial condition, and ability to continue to expand could be adversely affected.\nEven with good relationships with retailers, our ability to originate retail purchase loans is dependent, in large part, on the underlying consumer demand for retail goods. Retail sales are subject to fluctuation as a result of general economic trends and other factors. If sales volumes at the retailers with whom we have relationships decrease in the future as a result of general economic trends or due to any other factors, we may experience a corresponding decrease in the volume of such loans that we originate. In such circumstances, we may experience an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nInterest rates on retail purchase loans are determined at competitive market interest rates, and we may fail to adequately set interest rates, which may adversely affect our business.\nUnlike installment loans, particularly small installment loans, which in certain states are typically made at or near the maximum interest rates permitted by law, retail purchase loans are often made at competitive market interest rates, which are governed by laws for installment sales contracts. If we fail to set interest rates at a level that adequately reflects market rates or the credit risks of our customers, or if we set interest rates at a level too low to sustain our profitability, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nRegional Management Corp. | 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 25\nRegular turnover among our managers and other employees at our branches makes it more difficult for us to operate our branches and increases our costs of operations, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur workforce is comprised primarily of employees who work on an hourly basis. In certain areas where we operate, there is significant competition for employees. In the past, we have lost employees and candidates to competitors who have been willing to pay higher compensation. Our ability to continue to expand our operations depends on our ability to attract, train, and retain a large and growing number of qualified employees. The turnover among all of our branch employees was approximately 42% in 2016, 40% in 2017, and 51% in 2018. This turnover increases our cost of operations and makes it more difficult to operate our branches. Our account executives and assistant manager roles have historically experienced high turnover. We may not be able to retain and cultivate personnel at these ranks for future promotion to branch manager. If our employee turnover rates increase above historical levels or if unanticipated problems arise from our high employee turnover and we are unable to readily replace such employees, our business, results of operations, financial condition, and ability to continue to expand could be adversely affected.\nThe departure, transition, or replacement of key personnel could significantly impact the results of our operations. If we cannot continue to hire and retain high-quality employees, our business and financial results may be negatively affected.\nOur future success significantly depends on the continued service and performance of our key management personnel. Competition for these employees is intense. Our operating results could be adversely affected by higher employee turnover or increased salary and benefit costs. Like most businesses, our employees are important to our success and we are dependent in part on our ability to retain the services of our key management, operational, finance, and administrative personnel. We have built our business on a set of core values, and we attempt to hire employees who are committed to these values. We want to hire and retain employees who will fit our culture of compliance and of providing exceptional service to our customers. In order to compete and to continue to grow, we must attract, retain, and motivate employees, including those in executive, senior management, and operational positions. As our employees gain experience and develop their knowledge and skills, they become highly desired by other businesses. Therefore, to retain our employees, we must provide a satisfying work environment and competitive compensation and benefits. If costs to retain our skilled employees increase, then our business and financial results may be negatively affected.\nOur continued growth is also dependent, in part, on the skills, experience, and efforts of our executive officers and senior management. As previously announced on February 12, 2019, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Donald E. Thomas, is retiring from Regional, pending the appointment of a new Chief Financial Officer, and we have engaged an executive search firm to conduct a search for our new Chief Financial Officer. We may not be successful in retaining the other members of our executive or senior management team or our other key employees. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers, senior management, or key team members, including state vice presidents, or the inability to attract additional qualified personnel as needed, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We also depend on our district supervisors to supervise, train, and motivate our branch employees. These supervisors have significant experience with our company and within our industry, and would be difficult to replace. If we lose a district supervisor to a competitor, we could also be at risk of losing other employees and customers. In addition, the process of identifying management successors creates uncertainty and could become a distraction to our senior management and our Board of Directors, and we may not be successful in attracting qualified candidates to replace key positions when necessary. The identification and recruitment of candidates to fill senior management positions, and the resulting transition process, including in the search for and transition to a new Chief Financial Officer, may be disruptive to our business and operations.\nRegional Management Corp. | 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 26\nEmployee misconduct or misconduct by third parties acting on our behalf could harm us by subjecting us to significant legal liability, regulatory scrutiny, and reputational harm.\nOur reputation is critical to maintaining and developing relationships with our existing and potential customers and third parties with whom we do business. There is a risk that our employees or third-party contractors could engage in misconduct that adversely affects our business. For example, if an employee or third-party contractor were to engage-or be accused of engaging-in illegal or suspicious activities, we could be subject to regulatory sanctions and suffer serious harm to our reputation, financial condition, customer relationships, and ability to attract future customers. Employee or third-party misconduct could prompt regulators to allege or to determine, based upon such misconduct, that we have not established adequate supervisory systems and procedures to inform employees of applicable rules or to detect and deter violations of such rules. It is not always possible to deter employee or third-party misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent misconduct may not be effective in all cases. Misconduct by our employees or third-party contractors, or even unsubstantiated allegations, could result in a material adverse effect on our reputation and our business.\nSecurity breaches in our branches or acts of theft, fraud, or violence could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nA portion of our account payments occur at our branches, either in person or by mail, and often consist of cash payments, which we deposit at local banks throughout the day. This business practice exposes us daily to the potential for employee theft of funds or, alternatively, to theft and burglary due to the cash we maintain in our branches. Despite controls and procedures to prevent such losses, we have sustained losses due to employee theft and fraud (including collusion), including from the origination of fraudulent loans. We are also susceptible to break-ins at our branches, where money and/or customer records necessary for day-to-day operations (which also contain extensive confidential information about our customers, including financial and personally identifiable information) could be taken. A breach in the security of our branches or in the safety of our employees could result in employee injury, loss of funds or records, and adverse publicity, and could result in a loss of customer business or expose us to additional regulatory scrutiny and penalties, civil litigation, and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur risk management efforts may not be effective.\nWe could incur substantial losses and our business operations could be disrupted if we are unable to effectively identify, manage, monitor, and mitigate financial risks, such as credit risk, interest rate risk, prepayment risk, liquidity risk, and other market-related risks, as well as regulatory and operational risks related to our business, assets, and liabilities. Our risk management policies, procedures, and techniques may not be sufficient to identify all of the risks we are exposed to, mitigate the risks we have identified, or identify additional risks to which we may become subject in the future.\nWe may be unsuccessful in maintaining effective internal controls over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures.\nControls and procedures are particularly important for consumer finance companies. Effective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and, together with adequate disclosure controls and procedures, are designed to prevent fraud or material error. Any system of controls, however well-designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system are met. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d) requires management of public companies to develop and implement internal controls over financial reporting and evaluate the effectiveness thereof. Under standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, a material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material\nRegional Management Corp. | 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 27\nmisstatement of our financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those responsible for oversight of our financial reporting. Any failure to maintain current internal controls or implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their maintenance and/or implementation, could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations.\nIf material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting are discovered or occur in the future or if our controls and procedures fail or are circumvented, our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements, we could be required to restate our financial results, we may be unable to produce accurate and timely financial statements, and we may be unable to maintain compliance with applicable stock exchange listing requirements, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and stock price. The discovery of a material weakness and the disclosure of that fact, even if quickly remediated, could reduce the market value of shares of our common stock. Additionally, the existence of any material weakness or significant deficiency requires management to devote significant time and incur significant expense to remediate any such material weaknesses or significant deficiency, and management may not be able to remediate any such material weaknesses or significant deficiency in a timely manner. Undetected material weaknesses in our internal controls could lead to financial statement restatements, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operation.\nIf our estimates of reserves for credit losses are not adequate to absorb actual losses, our provision for credit losses would increase, which would adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses for all loans we make. To estimate the appropriate level of credit loss reserves, we consider known and relevant internal and external factors that affect loan collectability, including the total amount of loans outstanding; delinquency levels, roll rates, and trends; historical credit losses; our current collection patterns; and economic trends. Our methodology for establishing our reserves for credit losses is based in large part on our delinquency roll rates and our historic loss experience. If customer behavior changes as a result of economic, political, social, or other conditions and if we are unable to predict how the unemployment rate and general economic uncertainty may affect our credit loss reserves, our provision may be inadequate. During fiscal 2018, our provision for credit losses was $87.1 million, and we had net credit losses of $77.7 million related to losses on our loans. As of December 31, 2018, our finance receivables were $932.2 million. Maintaining the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses may require that we make significant and unanticipated increases in our provisions for credit losses, which would materially affect our results of operations. Our credit loss reserves, however, are estimates, and if actual credit losses are materially greater than our credit loss reserves, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Neither state regulators nor federal regulators regulate our allowance for credit losses.\nIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the \u201cFASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standard Update ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. This ASU significantly changes the way that entities will be required to measure credit losses. The new standard requires that the estimated credit loss be based upon an \u201cexpected credit loss\u201d approach rather than the \u201cincurred loss\u201d approach currently required. The new approach will require entities to measure all expected credit losses for financial assets based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable forecasts of collectability. It is anticipated that the expected credit loss model may require earlier recognition of credit losses than the incurred loss approach. This ASU will become effective for us for fiscal years beginning January 1, 2020. Early adoption is permitted for fiscal years beginning January 1, 2019. We believe the adoption of this ASU will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. See Note 2, \u201cSignificant Accounting Policies,\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for more information on this new accounting standard.\nRegional Management Corp. | 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 28\nIf assumptions or estimates we use in preparing our financial statements are incorrect or are required to change, our reported results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nWe are required to use certain assumptions and estimates in preparing our financial statements under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d), including in determining allowances for credit losses, the fair value of financial instruments, asset impairment, reserves related to litigation and other legal matters, the fair value of share-based compensation, valuation of income, and other taxes and regulatory exposures. In addition, significant assumptions and estimates are involved in determining certain disclosures required under GAAP, including those involving the fair value of our financial instruments. If the assumptions or estimates underlying our financial statements are incorrect, the actual amounts realized on transactions and balances subject to those estimates will be different, and this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, the FASB is currently reviewing or proposing changes to several financial accounting and reporting standards that govern key aspects of our financial statements, including areas where assumptions or estimates are required. As a result of changes to financial accounting or reporting standards, whether promulgated or required by the FASB or other regulators, we could be required to change certain of the assumptions or estimates we previously used in preparing our financial statements, which could negatively impact how we record and report our results of operations and financial condition generally. For additional information on the key areas for which assumptions and estimates are used in preparing our financial statements, see Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies\u201d and Note 2, \u201cSignificant Accounting Policies,\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nWe depend to a substantial extent on borrowings under our senior revolving credit facility to fund our liquidity needs.\nWe have a senior revolving credit facility committed through June 2020 that allows us to borrow up to $638.0 million, assuming we are in compliance with a number of covenants and conditions. The credit facility also has an accordion provision that allows for the expansion of the facility up to $700.0 million. The senior revolving credit facility is collateralized by certain of our assets, including substantially all of our finance receivables (other than those held by certain special purpose entities, as described below) and equity interests of the majority of our subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2018, the amount outstanding under our senior revolving credit facility was $328.1 million and we had $68.6 million of eligible borrowing capacity on the credit facility (subject to certain covenants and conditions). During fiscal 2018, the maximum amount of borrowings outstanding under the facility at any one time was $459.5 million. We use our senior revolving credit facility as a source of liquidity, including for working capital and to fund the loans we make to our customers. If our existing sources of liquidity become insufficient to satisfy our financial needs or our access to these sources becomes unexpectedly restricted, we may need to try to raise additional capital in the future. If such an event were to occur, we can give no assurance that such alternate sources of liquidity would be available to us on favorable terms or at all. In addition, we cannot be certain that we will be able to replace the amended and restated senior revolving credit facility when it matures on favorable terms or at all. If any of these events occur, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nThe credit agreements governing our long-term debt contain restrictions and limitations that could affect our ability to operate our business.\nThe credit agreements governing our senior revolving credit facility, revolving warehouse credit facility, and amortizing loan contain a number of covenants that could adversely affect our business and our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions or opportunities. Among other things, these covenants limit our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur or guarantee additional indebtedness;\nRegional Management Corp. | 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 29\n\u2022\npurchase loan portfolios in bulk;\n\u2022\npay dividends or make distributions on our capital stock or make certain other restricted payments;\n\u2022\nsell assets, including our loan portfolio or the capital stock of our subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with our affiliates;\n\u2022\noffer certain loan products;\n\u2022\ncreate or incur liens; and\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge, sell, or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets.\nThe credit agreements also impose certain obligations on us relating to our underwriting standards, recordkeeping and servicing of our loans, and our loss reserves and charge-off policies, and they require us to maintain certain financial ratios, including an interest coverage ratio and a borrowing base ratio. If we were to breach any covenants or obligations under our credit agreements and such breaches were to result in an event of default, our lenders could cause all amounts outstanding to become due and payable, subject to applicable grace periods. An event of default in any one credit agreement could also trigger cross-defaults under other existing and future credit agreements and other debt instruments, and materially and adversely affect our financial condition and ability to continue operating our business as a going concern.\nOur securitizations may expose us to financing and other risks, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to access the securitization market in the future, which may require us to seek more costly financing.\nWe completed our first securitization in June 2018 and our second securitization in December 2018, and we may in the future securitize certain of our finance receivables to generate cash to originate new finance receivables or to pay our outstanding indebtedness. In such transactions, we typically convey a pool of finance receivables to a special purpose entity, which, in turn, conveys the finance receivables to a trust (the issuing entity). Concurrently, the issuing entity issues non-recourse notes or certificates pursuant to the terms of an indenture and/or amended and restated trust agreement, which then are transferred to the special purpose entity in exchange for the finance receivables. The securities issued by the issuing entity are secured by the pool of finance receivables. In exchange for the transfer of finance receivables to the issuing entity, we typically receive the cash proceeds from the sale of the securities issued by the issuing entity, all residual interests, if any, in the cash flows from the finance receivables after payment of the securities, and a 100% beneficial interest in the issuing entity.\nAlthough we successfully completed our first two securitizations in 2018, we can give no assurances that we will be able to complete additional securitizations, including if, for example, the securitization markets become constrained. In addition, the value of any subordinated securities that we may retain in our securitizations might be reduced or, in some cases, eliminated as a result of an adverse change in economic conditions or other factors.\nRegional Management Corp. currently acts as the servicer (in such capacity, the \u201cServicer\u201d) with respect to each securitization. If the Servicer defaults in its servicing obligations, an early amortization event could occur under each securitization and the Servicer could be replaced as servicer. Servicer defaults include, but are not limited to, the failure of the Servicer to make any payment, transfer, or deposit in accordance with applicable securitization documents; breaches of representations, warranties, or agreements made by the Servicer under applicable securitization documents; and the occurrence of certain insolvency events with respect to the Servicer. Such an early amortization event could have materially adverse consequences on our liquidity and cost of funds.\nRating agencies may also affect our ability to execute a securitization transaction or increase the costs we expect to incur from executing securitization transactions, not only by deciding not to issue ratings for our\nRegional Management Corp. | 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 30\nsecuritization transactions, but also by altering the criteria and process they follow in issuing ratings. Rating agencies could alter their ratings processes or criteria after we have accumulated finance receivables for securitization in a manner that effectively reduces the value of those finance receivables by increasing our financing costs or otherwise requiring that we incur additional costs to comply with those processes and criteria. We have no ability to control or predict what actions the rating agencies may take.\nFurther, other matters, such as (i) accounting standards applicable to securitization transactions and (ii) capital and leverage requirements applicable to banks and other regulated financial institutions holding asset-backed securities, could result in decreased investor demand for securities issued through our securitization transactions or increased competition from other institutions that undertake securitization transactions. In addition, compliance with certain regulatory requirements, including the Dodd-Frank Act, may affect the type of securitization transactions that we are able to complete.\nAn inability to consummate further securitization transactions on terms similar to our existing securitization transactions, or at all, could require us to seek more costly financing and/or have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe may be required to indemnify, or repurchase certain finance receivables from, purchasers of finance receivables that we have sold or securitized, or which we will sell or securitize in the future, if our finance receivables fail to meet certain criteria or characteristics or under other circumstances, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nWe have entered into certain financing arrangements, including an amortizing loan and a revolving warehouse credit facility, that are secured by certain retail installment contracts and promissory notes (the \u201cReceivables\u201d). In June 2018, we securitized approximately $168.5 million of Receivables, and in December 2018, we securitized approximately $136.9 million of Receivables. Our operating subsidiaries originated the Receivables and subsequently transferred the Receivables to certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries that were established for the special purpose of entering into the financing arrangements and the respective securitizations. The documents governing our financing arrangements and securitizations contain provisions that require us to repurchase the affected Receivables under certain circumstances. While our financing and securitization documents vary, they generally contain customary provisions that require us and the special purpose entities to make certain representations and warranties about the quality and nature of the Receivables. Together with the special purpose entities, we may be required to repurchase the Receivables if a representation or warranty is later determined to be inaccurate. In such a case, we will be required to pay a repurchase price for the release of the affected Receivables.\nWe believe that many purchasers of loans and other counterparties to transactions like those provided for in the revolving warehouse credit facility, the amortizing loan, the securitizations, and other similar transactions are particularly aware of the conditions under which originators or sellers of such finance receivables must indemnify for or repurchase finance receivables, and may benefit from enforcing any available repurchase remedies. If we are required to repurchase Receivables that we have sold or pledged, it could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nWe are subject to interest rate risk resulting from general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies.\nInterest rate risk arises from the possibility that changes in interest rates will affect our results of operations and financial condition. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies, in particular, the Federal Reserve Board. Furthermore, market conditions or regulatory restrictions on interest rates we charge may prevent us from passing any increases in interest rates along to our customers. We originate finance receivables at either prevailing market rates or at statutory limits. Subject to statutory limits, our ability to react to changes in\nRegional Management Corp. | 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 31\nprevailing market rates is dependent upon the speed at which our customers pay off or renew loans in our existing loan portfolio, which allows us to originate new loans at prevailing market rates. Our loan portfolio turns over approximately 1.2 times per year from cash payments, renewals, and charged-off loans. Because our large loans have longer maturities than our small loans and typically renew at a slower rate than our small loans, the rate of turnover of the loan portfolio may change as our large loans change as a percentage of our portfolio.\nIn addition, rising interest rates will increase our cost of capital by influencing the amount of interest we pay on our senior revolving credit facility, our revolving warehouse credit facility, or any other floating interest rate obligations that we may incur, which would increase our operating costs and decrease our operating margins. Interest payable on our senior revolving credit facility and our revolving warehouse credit facility is variable and could increase in the future.\nFor additional information, see Part II, Item 7A, \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\u201d\nAny replacement of LIBOR as the basis on which our variable rate debt is calculated may harm our cost of capital, financial results, and cash flows.\nBorrowings under our senior revolving credit facility and our revolving warehouse credit facility bear interest at rates that are calculated based on LIBOR, and from time to time, we purchase interest rate cap contracts with strike rates that are also calculated based on LIBOR. In July 2017, the head of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority announced the desire to phase out the use of LIBOR by the end of 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, is considering replacing U.S.-dollar LIBOR with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR, a new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements, backed by Treasury securities. Although there have been a few issuances utilizing SOFR or the Sterling Over Night Index Average, an alternative reference rate that is based on transactions, it is unknown whether these alternative reference rates will attain market acceptance as replacements of LIBOR.\nIf LIBOR ceases to exist, the method and rate used to calculate our variable-rate debt in the future may result in interest rates and/or payments that are higher than, lower than, or that do not otherwise correlate over time with the interest rates and/or payments that would have been made on our obligations if LIBOR was available in its current form. There is currently no definitive information regarding the future utilization of LIBOR or of any particular replacement rate. As such, the potential effect of any such event on our cost of capital, financial results, and cash flows cannot yet be determined.\nOur use of derivatives exposes us to credit and market risk.\nFrom time to time, we enter into derivative transactions for economic hedging purposes, such as managing our exposure to interest rate risk. By using derivative instruments, we are exposed to credit and market risk, including the risk of loss associated with variations in the spread between the asset yield and the funding and/or hedge cost, default risk, and the risk of insolvency or other inability of the counterparty to a particular derivative transaction to perform its obligations. For additional information, see Part II, Item 7A, \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\u201d\nMacroeconomic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows, and may increase loan defaults and affect the value and liquidity of your investment.\nWe are not insulated from the pressures and potentially negative consequences of financial crises and similar risks beyond our control that have in the past and may in the future affect the capital and credit markets, the broader economy, the financial services industry, or the segment of that industry in which we operate. Our\nRegional Management Corp. | 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 32\nfinancial performance generally, and in particular the ability of our borrowers to make payments on outstanding loans, is highly dependent upon the business and economic environments in the markets where we operate and in the United States as a whole.\nDuring an economic downturn or recession, credit losses in the financial services industry generally increase and demand for credit products often decreases. Declining asset values, defaults on consumer loans, and the lack of market and investor confidence, as well as other factors, all combine to decrease liquidity during an economic downturn. As a result of these factors, some banks and other lenders have suffered significant losses during economic downturns, and the strength and liquidity of many financial institutions worldwide weakened during the most recent economic crisis. Additionally, during an economic downturn, our loan servicing costs and collection costs may increase as we may have to expend greater time and resources on these activities. Our underwriting criteria, policies and procedures, and product offerings may not sufficiently protect our growth and profitability during a sustained period of economic downturn or recession. Any renewed economic downturn will adversely affect the financial resources of our customers and may result in the inability of our customers to make principal and interest payments on, or refinance, the outstanding debt when due.\nIn addition, periods of economic slowdown or recession are typically accompanied by decreased consumer demand for retail goods. Our ability to originate retail purchase loans depends, in large part, on the underlying demand for such products. Further, our business is focused on customers who generally do not qualify for conventional retail financing, and customers in this demographic are more likely to be affected, and more severely affected, by an economic downturn. Accordingly, our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows may be adversely impacted during any economic downturn or recession.\nShould economic conditions worsen, they may adversely affect the credit quality of our loans. In the event of increased default by borrowers under the loans, and/or a decrease in the volume of the loans we originate, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nA prolonged shutdown of the federal government may result in higher delinquency and could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe U.S. federal government experienced a partial shutdown from December 22, 2018 until January 25, 2019, and we do not yet know the full impact of the shutdown on our customers, business, results of operations, and financial condition. Delinquencies in our loan portfolio generally reach their lowest point in the first quarter of the year, which we believe is largely due to the timing of income tax refunds. A federal government shutdown could lead to a delay in our customers receiving their income tax refunds as a result of employees of the Internal Revenue Service not being available to process refunds. If our customers do not timely receive their income tax refunds, we could experience higher delinquency and losses in our loan portfolio. Furthermore, a federal government shutdown could result in reduced income for government employees or employees of companies that engage in business with the federal government, which could result in higher loan delinquencies, increased credit losses, and a decrease in demand for our loan products. Additionally, during and immediately following a prolonged government shutdown, our loan servicing costs and collection costs may increase as we may have to expend greater time and resources on these activities. As a result, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nDamage to our reputation could negatively impact our business.\nRecently, financial services companies have been experiencing increased reputational risk as consumers and the media take issue with certain of their practices or judgments. Maintaining a strong reputation is critical to our attracting and retaining customers, investors, and employees. Harm to our reputation can arise from many sources, including employee misconduct, misconduct by outsourced service providers or other counterparties, litigation or regulatory actions, failure by us to meet minimum standards of service and quality, inadequate protection of customer information, and compliance failures. Negative publicity regarding our company (or others engaged in a similar business or similar activities), whether or not accurate, may damage our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nRegional Management Corp. | 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 33\nRisks Related to Regulation and Legal Proceedings\nOur business products and activities are strictly and comprehensively regulated at the local, state, and federal levels.\nThe consumer finance industry is extensively regulated by federal, state, and local laws and regulations, including consumer protection laws and regulations relating to the creation, collection, and enforcement of consumer contracts, such as consumer loans. These laws and regulations impose significant costs and limitations on the way we conduct and expand our business, and these costs and limitations may increase in the future if such laws and regulations are changed. These laws and regulations govern or affect, among other things:\n\u2022\nthe interest rates and manner of calculating such rates that we may charge customers;\n\u2022\nterms of loans, including fees, maximum amounts, and minimum durations;\n\u2022\norigination practices;\n\u2022\ndisclosure requirements, including posting of fees;\n\u2022\nsolicitation and advertising practices;\n\u2022\ncurrency and suspicious activity reporting;\n\u2022\nrecording and reporting of certain financial transactions;\n\u2022\nprivacy of personal customer information;\n\u2022\nthe types of products and services that we may offer;\n\u2022\nservicing and collection practices;\n\u2022\napproval of licenses; and\n\u2022\nlocations of our branches.\nDue to the highly regulated nature of the consumer finance industry, we are required to comply with a wide array of federal, state, and local laws and regulations that affect, among other things, the manner in which we conduct our origination and servicing operations. These laws and regulations directly impact our business and require constant compliance, monitoring, and internal and external audits. Although we have an enterprise-wide compliance framework structured to continuously evaluate our activities, compliance with applicable law is costly and may create operational constraints.\nAt a federal level, these laws and their implementing regulations include, among others, the Truth in Lending Act and Regulation Z, the Consumer Financial Protection Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, the Military Lending Act, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, and requirements related to unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices. Many states and local jurisdictions have consumer protection laws analogous to, or in addition to, those listed above, such as usury laws and state debt collection practices laws that apply to first-party lenders. These federal, state, and local laws regulate the manner in which consumer finance companies deal with customers when making loans or conducting other types of financial transactions.\nChanges to statutes, regulations, or regulatory policies, including the interpretation, implementation, and enforcement of statutes, regulations, or policies, could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways, including limiting the types of financial services and products that we may offer and increasing the ability of competitors to offer competing financial services and products. Compliance with laws and regulations requires us to invest increasingly significant portions of our resources in compliance planning and training, monitoring tools, and personnel, and requires the time and attention of management. These costs divert capital and focus away from efforts intended to grow our business. Because these laws and regulations are complex and often subject to\nRegional Management Corp. | 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 34\ninterpretation, or because of a result of unintended errors, we may, from time to time, inadvertently violate these laws, regulations, and policies, as each is interpreted by our regulators. If we do not successfully comply with laws, regulations, or policies, we could be subject to fines, penalties, lawsuits, or judgments, our compliance costs could increase, our operations could be limited, and we may suffer damage to our reputation. If more restrictive laws, rules, and regulations are enacted or more restrictive judicial and administrative interpretations of current laws are issued, compliance with the laws could become more expensive or difficult. Furthermore, changes in these laws and regulations could require changes in the way we conduct our business, and we cannot predict the impact such changes would have on our profitability.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act also may adversely affect the securitization market because it requires, among other things, that the sponsor of a securitization transaction or a majority-owned affiliate of the sponsor retain not less than 5% of the credit risk of the assets collateralizing the asset-backed securities. The risk retention requirement may limit our ability to securitize loans. The impact of the risk retention rule on the asset-backed securities market remains uncertain. In addition, rules relating to securitizations rated by nationally-recognized statistical rating agencies require that the findings of any third-party due diligence service providers be made publicly available at least five (5) business days prior to the first sale of securities, which has led, and will continue to lead, us to incur additional costs in connection with each securitization.\nOur primary regulators are the state regulators for the states in which we operate. We operate each of our branches under licenses granted to us by these state regulators. State regulators may enter our branches and conduct audits of our records and practices at any time, with or without notice. If we fail to observe, or are not able to comply with, applicable legal requirements, we may be forced to discontinue certain product offerings, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, violation of these laws and regulations could result in fines and other civil and/or criminal penalties, including the suspension or revocation of our branch licenses, rendering us unable to operate in one or more locations. All of the states in which we operate have laws governing the interest rates and fees that we can charge and required disclosure statements, among other restrictions. Violation of these laws could involve penalties requiring the forfeiture of principal and/or interest and fees that we have charged. Depending on the nature and scope of a violation, fines and other penalties for noncompliance of applicable requirements could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWhile we believe that we maintain all material licenses and permits required for our current operations and are in substantial compliance with all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations, we may not be able to maintain all requisite licenses and permits, and the failure to satisfy those and other regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our operations. In addition, changes in laws or regulations applicable to us could subject us to additional licensing, registration, and other regulatory requirements in the future or could adversely affect our ability to operate or the manner in which we conduct business. Licenses to open new branches are granted in the discretion of state regulators. Accordingly, licenses may be denied unexpectedly or for reasons outside of our control. This could hinder our ability to implement our business plans in a timely manner or at all.\nAs we enter new markets and develop new products and services, we may become subject to additional local, state, and federal laws and regulations. For example, although we intend to expand into new states, we may encounter unexpected regulatory or other difficulties in these new states, including as they relate to securing the necessary licenses to operate, which may inhibit our growth. As a result, we may not be able to successfully execute our strategies to grow our revenue and earnings.\nWe are also subject to potential enforcement, supervision, or other actions that may be brought by state attorneys general or other state enforcement authorities and other governmental agencies. For example, the CFPB, state and federal banking regulators, state attorneys general, the Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Department of Justice, and federal government agencies have imposed sanctions on consumer loan originators for practices including, but not limited to, charging borrowers excessive fees, steering borrowers to loans with\nRegional Management Corp. | 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 35\nhigher costs or more onerous terms, imposing higher interest rates than the borrower\u2019s credit risk warrants, failing to disclose material terms of loans to borrowers, and otherwise engaging in discriminatory or unfair lending practices or unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices. While we believe we are in substantial compliance with all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations, a contrary determination by a regulator, and any resulting action, could subject us to civil money penalties, customer remediation, and increased compliance costs, as well as damage to our reputation and brand and could limit or prohibit our ability to offer certain products and services or engage in certain business practices.\nAdditionally, Congress, the states, and regulatory agencies could further regulate the consumer credit industry in ways that make it more difficult for us to conduct business. Further, changes in the regulatory application or judicial interpretation of the laws and regulations applicable to financial institutions also could impact the manner in which we conduct our business. The regulatory environment in which financial institutions operate has become increasingly complex and robust, and following the financial crisis of 2008, supervisory efforts to apply relevant laws, regulations, and policies have become more intense. Any of the events described above could have a material adverse effect on all aspects of our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe may become involved in investigations, examinations, and proceedings by government and self-regulatory agencies, which may result in material adverse consequences to our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFrom time to time, we may become involved in formal and informal reviews, investigations, examinations, proceedings, and information-gathering requests by federal and state government and self-regulatory agencies. Should we become subject to such an investigation, examination, or proceeding, the matter could result in material adverse consequences to us, including, but not limited to, increased compliance costs, adverse judgments, significant settlements, fines, penalties, injunction, or other actions.\nChanges in laws and regulations or interpretations of laws and regulations could negatively impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nThe laws and regulations directly affecting our lending activities are constantly under review and are subject to change. In addition, consumer advocacy groups and various other media sources continue to advocate for governmental and regulatory action to prohibit or severely restrict various financial products, including the loan products we offer. Any changes in such laws and regulations, or the implementation, interpretation, or enforcement of such laws and regulations, could force us to modify, suspend, or cease part or, in the worst case, all of our existing operations. It is also possible that the scope of federal regulations could change or expand in such a way as to preempt what has traditionally been state law regulation of our business activities. The enactment of one or more of such regulatory changes could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and prospects.\nState and federal legislatures and regulators may also seek to impose new requirements or interpret or enforce existing requirements in new ways. Changes in current laws or regulations or the implementation of new laws or regulations in the future may restrict our ability to continue our current methods of operation or expand our operations. For example, on December 10, 2018, legislation referred to as the \u201cUnsolicited Loan Act of 2018\u201d was introduced in the Senate. This legislation would prohibit the practice of directly mailing convenience checks to potential borrowers. In order for this legislation to progress, it would have to be reintroduced in Congress, which has not yet occurred. If the Unsolicited Loan Act of 2018 or a similar bill were to be reintroduced and ultimately become law, we would no longer be permitted to mail convenience check offers to potential customers, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and prospects.\nAdditionally, new laws and regulations could subject us to liability for prior operating activities or lower or eliminate the profitability of operations going forward by, among other things, reducing the amount of interest\nRegional Management Corp. | 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 36\nand fees we charge in connection with our loans or limiting the types of insurance and other ancillary products that we may offer to our customers. If these or other factors lead us to close our branches in a state, in addition to the loss of net revenues attributable to that closing, we would incur closing costs such as lease cancellation payments and we would have to write off assets that we could no longer use. If we were to suspend rather than permanently cease our operations in a state, we would also have continuing costs associated with maintaining our branches and our employees in that state, with little or no revenues to offset those costs.\nIn addition to state and federal laws and regulations, our business is subject to various local rules and regulations, such as local zoning regulations. Local zoning boards and other local governing bodies have been increasingly restricting the permitted locations of consumer finance companies. Any future actions taken to require special use permits for or impose other restrictions on our ability to provide products could adversely affect our ability to expand our operations or force us to attempt to relocate existing branches. If we were forced to relocate any of our branches, in addition to the costs associated with the relocation, we may be required to hire new employees in the new areas, which may adversely impact the operations of those branches. Relocation of an existing branch may also hinder our collection abilities, as our business model relies in part on the location of our branches being close to where our customers live in order to successfully collect on outstanding loans.\nChanges in laws or regulations may have a material adverse effect on all aspects of our business in a particular state and on our overall business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act authorizes the CFPB to adopt rules and undertake supervisory and enforcement activity that could potentially have a serious impact on our ability to offer installment loans or otherwise materially and adversely affect our operations and financial performance.\nTitle X of the Dodd-Frank Act establishes the CFPB, which became operational on July 21, 2011. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFPB has regulatory, supervisory, and enforcement powers over providers of consumer financial products that we offer, including explicit supervisory authority to examine and require registration of installment lenders such as ourselves. Included in the powers afforded to the CFPB is the authority to adopt rules describing specified acts and practices as being \u201cunfair,\u201d \u201cdeceptive,\u201d or \u201cabusive,\u201d and hence unlawful. Specifically, the CFPB has the authority to declare an act or practice abusive if it, among other things, materially interferes with the ability of a consumer to understand a term or condition of a consumer financial product or service or takes unreasonable advantage of a lack of understanding on the part of the consumer of the product or service.\nAlthough the Dodd-Frank Act expressly provides that the CFPB has no authority to establish usury limits, some consumer advocacy groups have suggested that certain forms of alternative consumer finance products, such as traditional installment loans, should be a regulatory priority, and it is possible that the CFPB could propose and adopt rules making the products that we offer materially less profitable or impractical. Further, the CFPB may target specific features of loans or loan practices, such as refinancings, by rulemaking that could cause us to cease offering certain products or cease engaging in certain practices. The CFPB could also adopt rules imposing new and potentially burdensome requirements and limitations with respect to any of our current or future products or lines of business or on our methods of servicing our loans. Any such rules could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation, and financial condition.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act also gives the CFPB the authority to examine and regulate entities it classifies as a \u201clarger participant of a market for other consumer financial products or services.\u201d In the past, the CFPB has indicated that it may in the future issue a proposed rule defining larger participants in the installment lending market. The CFPB has not yet issued a \u201clarger participant\u201d rule applicable to us. However, if in the future we are covered by a final larger participant rule for the installment lending market, we will be subject to related CFPB supervisory examinations.\nIn addition to the Dodd-Frank Act\u2019s grant of regulatory powers to the CFPB, the Dodd-Frank Act gives the CFPB authority to pursue administrative proceedings or litigation for violations of federal consumer financial\nRegional Management Corp. | 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 37\nlaws. In these proceedings, the CFPB can obtain cease and desist orders (which can include orders for restitution or rescission of contracts, as well as other kinds of affirmative relief) and monetary penalties ranging from a maximum of $5,639 per day for minor violations of federal consumer financial laws (including the CFPB\u2019s own rules) to $28,195 per day for reckless violations and $1,127,799 per day for knowing violations. If we are subject to such administrative proceedings, litigation, orders, or monetary penalties in the future, it could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial performance. Also, where a company has violated Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act or CFPB regulations under Title X, the Dodd-Frank Act empowers state attorneys general and state regulators to bring civil actions for the kind of cease and desist orders available to the CFPB (but not for civil penalties). If the CFPB or one or more state officials find that we have violated the foregoing laws, they could exercise their enforcement powers in ways that would have a material adverse effect on us.\nIn addition to preexisting enforcement rights for state attorneys general, the Dodd-Frank Act gives attorneys general authority to enforce the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations promulgated under the Dodd-Frank Act\u2019s authority. In conducting an investigation, the CFPB or state attorneys general may issue a civil investigative demand requiring a target company to prepare and submit, among other items, documents, written reports, answers to interrogatories, and deposition testimony. If we are subject to investigation, the required response could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources. In addition, the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of the initiation of a CFPB investigation of our company or even the perception that such an investigation could occur, even in the absence of any finding by the CFPB that we have violated any state or federal law.\nAlthough many of the regulations implementing portions of the Dodd-Frank Act have been promulgated, we are still unable to predict how this significant legislation may be interpreted and enforced or the full extent to which implementing regulations and supervisory policies may affect us. Finally, President Donald Trump and the Congressional majority have indicated that the Dodd-Frank Act will be under further scrutiny and some of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and rules promulgated thereunder, including those provisions establishing the CFPB and the rules and regulations proposed and enacted by the CFPB, may be revised, repealed, or amended, but there can be no assurance that future reforms will not significantly and adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe sell certain of our loans, including, in some instances, charged-off loans and loans where the borrower is in default. This practice could subject us to heightened regulatory scrutiny, expose us to legal action, cause us to incur losses, and/or limit or impede our collection activity.\nAs part of our business model, we have purchased and sold, and may in the future purchase and sell, some of our finance receivables, including loans that have been charged-off and loans where the borrower is in default. The CFPB and other regulators recently have significantly increased their scrutiny of debt sales, especially delinquent and charged-off debt. The CFPB has criticized sellers of debt for insufficient documentation to support and verify the validity or amount of the debt. It has also criticized debt collectors for, among other things, collection tactics, attempting to collect debts that are no longer valid, misrepresenting the amount of the debt, not having sufficient documentation to verify the validity or amount of the debt, and failing to obtain or maintain proper licenses. Accordingly, our sales of loans could expose us to lawsuits or fines by regulators if we do not have sufficient documentation to support and verify the validity and amount of the loans underlying the transactions, or if we or purchasers of our loans use collection methods that are viewed as unfair, deceptive, or abusive. In addition, our collections could suffer and we may incur additional expenses if we are required to change collection practices or stop collecting on certain debts as a result of a lawsuit or action on the part of regulators.\nOur use of third-party vendors is subject to increasing regulatory attention.\nThe CFPB and other regulators have issued regulatory guidance that has focused on the need for financial institutions to oversee their business relationships with service providers in a manner that ensures such service\nRegional Management Corp. | 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 38\nproviders comply with applicable law. This results in increased due diligence and ongoing monitoring of third-party vendor relationships, thus increasing the scope of management involvement and decreasing the benefit that we receive from using third-party vendors. Moreover, if regulators conclude that we have not met the heightened standards for oversight of our third-party vendors, we could be subject to enforcement actions, civil monetary penalties, supervisory orders to cease and desist, or other remedial actions, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results\nWe are subject to government regulations concerning our hourly and our other employees, including minimum wage, overtime, and health care laws.\nWe are subject to applicable rules and regulations relating to our relationship with our employees, including minimum wage and break requirements, health benefits, unemployment and sales taxes, overtime, and working conditions and immigration status. Legislated increases in the federal minimum wage and increases in additional labor cost components, such as employee benefit costs, workers\u2019 compensation insurance rates, compliance costs and fines, as well as the cost of litigation in connection with these regulations, would increase our labor costs. Unionizing and collective bargaining efforts have received increased attention nationwide in recent periods. Should our employees become represented by unions, we would be obligated to bargain with those unions with respect to wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment, which is likely to increase our labor costs. Moreover, as part of the process of union organizing and collective bargaining, strikes and other work stoppages may occur, which would cause disruption to our business. Similarly, many employers nationally in similar retail environments have been subject to actions brought by governmental agencies and private individuals under wage-hour laws on a variety of claims, such as improper classification of workers as exempt from overtime pay requirements and failure to pay overtime wages properly, with such actions sometimes brought as class actions. These actions can result in material liabilities and expenses. Should we be subject to employment litigation, such as actions involving wage-hour, overtime, break, and working time, it may distract our management from business matters and result in increased labor costs. In addition, we currently sponsor employer-subsidized premiums for major medical programs for eligible personnel who elect health care coverage through our insurance programs. As a result of regulatory changes, we may not be able to continue to offer health care coverage to our employees on affordable terms or at all and subsequently may face increased difficulty in hiring and retaining employees. If we are unable to locate, attract, train, or retain qualified personnel, or if our costs of labor increase significantly, our business, results of operations, and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nOur stock price or results of operations could be adversely affected by media and public perception of installment loans and of legislative and regulatory developments affecting activities within the installment lending sector.\nConsumer advocacy groups and various media sources continue to criticize alternative financial services providers (such as payday and title lenders, check advance companies, and pawnshops). These critics frequently characterize such alternative financial services providers as predatory or abusive toward consumers. If these persons were to criticize the products that we offer, it could result in further regulation of our business and could negatively impact our relationships with existing borrowers and efforts to attract new borrowers. Furthermore, our industry is highly regulated, and announcements regarding new or expected governmental and regulatory action in the alternative financial services sector may adversely impact our stock price and perceptions of our business even if such actions are not targeted at our operations and do not directly impact us.\nLegal proceedings to which we may become subject may have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations.\nLike many companies in our industry, we are from time to time involved in various legal proceedings and subject to claims and other actions related to our business activities brought by borrowers and others. All such legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and, regardless of the merits of the claims, litigation is often\nRegional Management Corp. | 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 39\nexpensive, time-consuming, disruptive to our operations and resources, and distracting to management. If resolved against us, such legal proceedings could result in excessive verdicts and judgments, injunctive relief, equitable relief, and other adverse consequences that may affect our financial condition and how we operate our business. Similarly, if we settle such legal proceedings, it may affect our financial condition and how we operate our business. Future court decisions, alternative dispute resolution awards, business expansion, or legislative activity may increase our exposure to litigation and regulatory investigations. In some cases, substantial non-economic remedies or punitive damages may be sought. Although we maintain liability insurance coverage, there can be no assurance that such coverage will cover any particular verdict, judgment, or settlement that may be entered against us, that such coverage will prove to be adequate, or that such coverage will continue to remain available on acceptable terms, if at all. If in any legal proceeding we incur liability or defense costs that exceed our insurance coverage or that are not within the scope of our insurance coverage, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nCurrent and proposed regulation related to consumer privacy, data protection, and information security could increase our costs.\nWe are subject to a number of federal and state consumer privacy, data protection, and information security laws and regulations. Moreover, various federal and state regulatory agencies require us to notify customers in the event of a security breach. Federal and state legislators and regulators are increasingly pursuing new guidance, laws, and regulations. Compliance with current or future customer privacy, data protection, and information security laws and regulations could result in higher compliance, technology, or other operating costs. Any violations of these laws and regulations may require us to change our business practices or operational structure, and could subject us to legal claims, monetary penalties, sanctions, and the obligation to indemnify and/or notify customers or take other remedial actions.\nU.S. federal income tax reform may impact our financial results in unexpected ways or may otherwise have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOn December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d) that significantly reformed the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The Tax Act contains significant changes to corporate taxation, including a reduction of the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, a limitation on the tax deduction for interest expense to 30% of earnings (except for certain small businesses), a limitation on the deduction for net operating losses to 80% of current year taxable income and elimination of net operating loss carrybacks, immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time, and modifying or repealing many business deductions and credits. While our accounting for provisional adjustments in the 2017 financial statements for impacts of the Tax Act was completed in 2018, the Internal Revenue Service did not issue guidance on all elements of the Tax Act in 2018. Accordingly, the overall impact of the Tax Act is uncertain and the ultimate impact may prove to be inconsistent with our current expectations. As a result, the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely affected by the Tax Act, the interpretation and administration of the Tax Act, and/or any future tax reform legislation.\nIn addition, the Tax Act, its implementing regulations, and associated regulatory guidance significantly changed certain aspects of individual taxation, including tax rates and employer tax withholding requirements. Our customers often utilize income tax refunds in part to make payments on their loans with us, which we believe materially impacts the delinquency levels in our loan portfolio in the first quarter of each year. As a result of the Tax Act, beginning in 2019, our customers may receive an income tax refund that is smaller than the refund that they expect or to which they have become accustomed, or our customers may receive no income tax refund and instead owe additional tax payments. If this were to occur, our customers would have fewer financial resources to make payments on their loans with us. As a result, we could experience higher delinquencies and losses in our loan portfolio, which would adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nRegional Management Corp. | 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 40\nRisks Related to the Ownership of Our Common Stock\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they downgrade their recommendations regarding our common stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If any of the analysts who cover us downgrades our common stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our common stock price may decline. If analysts cease coverage of us or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our common stock price or trading volume to decline and our common stock to be less liquid.\nThe market price of shares of our common stock may continue to be volatile, which could cause the value of your investment to decline.\nThe market price of our common stock has been highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations. Securities markets worldwide experience significant price and volume fluctuations. This market volatility, as well as general economic, market, or political conditions, could reduce the market price of shares of our common stock in spite of our operating performance. In addition, our operating results and the market price of our common stock could be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors due to a number of potential factors, including variations in our quarterly operating results, additions or departures of key management personnel, failure to meet analysts\u2019 earnings estimates, publication of research reports about our industry, litigation and government investigations, changes or proposed changes in laws or regulations or differing interpretations or enforcement thereof affecting our business, adverse market reaction to any indebtedness we may incur or securities we may issue in the future, changes in market valuations of similar companies, speculation in the press or investment community, announcements by our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, dispositions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments, adverse publicity about the industries we participate in, or individual scandals.\nWe have no current plans to pay cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future.\nWe do not expect to pay cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Instead, we intend to retain future earnings, if any, for future operation, expansion, and debt repayment. The declaration, amount, and payment of any future cash dividends on shares of common stock will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors may take into account general and economic conditions, our financial condition and results of operations, our available cash and current and anticipated cash needs, capital requirements, contractual, legal, tax, and regulatory restrictions and implications on the payment of cash dividends by us to our stockholders or by our subsidiaries to us, and such other factors as our Board of Directors may deem relevant. In addition, our ability to pay cash dividends may be limited by covenants of any existing and future outstanding indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur, including our senior revolving credit facility. As a result, investors may need to rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may not occur, as the only way to realize future gains on their investment.\nYour stock ownership may be diluted by the future issuance of additional common stock in connection with our incentive plans, acquisitions, or otherwise.\nWe have approximately 987 million shares of common stock authorized but unissued, as of March 7, 2019. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue these shares of common stock and options, rights, warrants, and appreciation rights relating to common stock for the consideration and on the terms and conditions established by our Board of Directors in its discretion, whether in connection with acquisitions or otherwise. Our stockholders previously approved the Regional Management Corp. 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan (as amended and/or restated, the \u201c2015 Plan\u201d). Subject to adjustments as provided in the 2015 Plan, the maximum aggregate number of shares of our common stock that may be issued under the 2015 Plan may not\nRegional Management Corp. | 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 41\nexceed the sum of (a) 1,550,000 shares plus (b) any shares (i) remaining available for the grant of awards as of the effective date under the 2007 Management Incentive Plan (the \u201c2007 Plan\u201d) or the 2011 Stock Incentive Plan (the \u201c2011 Plan\u201d), and/or (ii) subject to an award granted under the 2007 Plan or the 2011 Plan, which award is forfeited, cancelled, terminated, expires or lapses. We have 885,742 shares available for issuance under the 2015 Plan, as of March 7, 2019. In addition, our Board may recommend in the future that our stockholders approve new stock plans. Any common stock that we issue, including under our 2015 Plan or other equity incentive plans that we may adopt in the future, would dilute the percentage ownership held by our stockholders. In addition, the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of common stock in the market or the perception that such sales could occur. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to issue equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and applicable state law might discourage or delay acquisition attempts for us that you might consider favorable.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult without the approval of our Board of Directors. Among other things, these provisions:\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance of undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and the shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval, and which may include super voting, special approval, dividend, or other rights or preferences superior to the rights of the holders of common stock;\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent, which will require all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nprovide that the Board of Directors is expressly authorized to make, alter, or repeal our bylaws and that our stockholders may only amend our bylaws with the approval of 80% or more of all of the outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote; and\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nIn addition, certain states require the approval of a state regulator for the acquisition, directly or indirectly, of more than a certain amount of the voting or common stock of a consumer finance company. The overall effect of these laws is to make it more difficult to acquire a consumer finance company than it might be to acquire control of a nonregulated corporation.\nFurthermore, as a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law, which may impair a takeover attempt that our stockholders may find beneficial. These anti-takeover provisions and other provisions under Delaware law could discourage, delay, or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company, including actions that our stockholders may deem advantageous, or negatively affect the trading price of our common stock. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions you desire.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains a provision renouncing our interest and expectancy in certain corporate opportunities identified by our non-employee directors and their affiliates.\nCertain of our non-employee directors and their affiliates are in the business of providing buyout capital and growth capital to developing companies and may acquire interests in businesses that directly or indirectly compete with certain portions of our business. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides for the allocation of certain corporate opportunities between us, on the one hand, and certain of our non-employee\nRegional Management Corp. | 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 42\ndirectors and their affiliates, on the other hand. As set forth in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, such non-employee directors and their affiliates shall not have any duty to refrain from engaging, directly or indirectly, in the same business activities or similar business activities or lines of business in which we operate. Therefore, a non-employee director of our company may pursue certain acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and, as a result, such acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. These potential conflicts of interest could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects if attractive corporate opportunities are allocated by such non-employee directors to themselves or their other affiliates instead of to us.\nRegional Management Corp. | 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 43", "PERMNO": 13302, "SIC": 6141, "TIC": "RM"}
