{"cik": "33488", "company": "ESCALADE INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-22", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nOPERATIONAL RISKS TO THE COMPANY AND OUR BUSINESS\nMarkets are highly competitive which could limit the Company\u2019s growth and reduce profitability.\nThe market for sporting goods is highly fragmented and intensely competitive. A majority of the Company\u2019s products are in markets that are experiencing low growth rates. Escalade competes with a variety of regional, national and international manufacturers for customers, employees, products, services and other important aspects of the business. The Company has historically sold a large percentage of its sporting goods products to mass merchandisers and has increasingly attempted to expand sales to specialty retailer and dealer markets and to on-line retailers. In addition to competition for sales into those distribution channels, vendors also must compete in sporting goods with large format sporting goods stores, traditional sporting goods stores and chains, warehouse clubs, discount stores and department stores. Competition from on-line retailers may also impact sales. Some of the current and potential competitors are larger than Escalade and have substantially greater financial resources that may be devoted to sourcing, promoting and selling their products, and may discount prices more heavily than the Company can afford.\nIf the Company is unable to predict or effectively react to changes in consumer demand, it may lose customers and sales may decline.\nSuccess depends in part on the ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing consumer demand and preferences regarding sporting goods. Products must appeal to a broad range of consumers whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to change. The Company often makes commitments to manufacture products months in advance of the proposed delivery to customers. If Escalade misjudges the market for products, sales may decline significantly. The Company may have to take significant inventory markdowns on unpopular products that are overproduced and/or miss opportunities for other products that may rise in popularity, both of which could have a negative impact on profitability. A major shift in consumer demand away from sporting goods products could also have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company may pursue strategic acquisitions, divestitures, or investments and the failure of a strategic transaction to produce anticipated results or the inability to fully integrate an acquired company could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company has made acquisitions of complementary companies or businesses, which have been part of the strategic plan, and may continue to pursue acquisitions in the future from time to time. Acquisitions may result in difficulties in assimilating acquired companies, and may result in the diversion of capital and management\u2019s attention from other business issues and opportunities. The Company may not be able to successfully integrate operations that it acquires, including personnel, financial and information systems, cybersecurity measures, distribution, and operating procedures. If the Company fails to successfully integrate acquisitions, the Company\u2019s business could suffer. In addition, acquisitions may result in the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, amortization expense or write-offs of goodwill or other intangibles, any of which could affect the Company\u2019s financial position. The Company also has sometimes divested or discontinued certain operations, assets, and products that did not perform to the Company\u2019s expectations or no longer fit with the Company\u2019s strategic objectives.\nDivestitures may result in gains, losses, contingent liabilities, write-offs, tax consequences, or other related costs and expenses that could affect the Company\u2019s financial position. Escalade will consider acquisitions, divestitures, and investments in the future, one or more of which, individually or in the aggregate, could be material to the Company\u2019s overall business, operations or financial position.\nGrowth may strain resources, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and financial performance.\nThe Company has grown in the past through strategic acquisitions, and continues to make acquisitions in its Sporting Goods business. Our growth strategy also depends on our ability to grow our e-commerce business, including the development of our own direct to consumer e-commerce distribution channel. Growth places additional demands on management and operational systems. If the Company is not successful in continuing to support operational and financial systems, expanding the management team and increasing and effectively managing customers and suppliers, growth may result in operational inefficiencies and ineffective management of the Company\u2019s business, which could adversely affect its business and financial performance.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to operate and expand its business and to respond to changing business and economic conditions will be dependent upon the availability of adequate capital.\nThe rate of expansion will also depend on the availability of adequate capital, which in turn will depend in large part on cash flow generated by the business and the availability of equity and debt capital. The Company can make no assurances that it will be able to obtain equity or debt capital on acceptable terms or at all. Our current senior secured revolving credit facility contains provisions that limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness or make substantial asset sales, which might otherwise be used to finance our operations. In the event of our insolvency, liquidation, dissolution or reorganization, the lenders under our senior secured revolving credit facility would be entitled to payment in full from our assets before distributions, if any, to our stockholders.\nThe Company is currently transitioning to a new Interim Chief Executive Officer and will soon commence the process of seeking a new Chief Executive Officer, which may result in some disruption to the Company.\nOn February 22, 2021, the Company announced that former Chief Executive Officer Scott J. Sincerbeaux had resigned from all positions with the Company. While the Chairman of the Board of Directors, Walter P. Glazer, Jr., has agreed to serve as the Company\u2019s Interim Chief Executive Officer until a replacement is hired, the transition may result in some disruptions to the Company\u2019s ordinary course of operations. Additionally, the process of seeking a new Chief Executive Officer requires substantial effort and time of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors and other executives, which may divert attention from other matters.\nThe Company could suffer if it fails to attract and retain skilled management and key personnel.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends in large part on its ability to attract and retain highly qualified management executives and key personnel. Significant competition for qualified candidates exists in the Company\u2019s business lines and geographic locations. If the Company is not able to hire and retain its executives and key personnel, or if the compensation costs required to attract and retain such individuals becomes more expensive, the Company may suffer adverse consequences to its business, operations, and financial condition.\nThe Company derives a substantial portion of its revenue from a few significant customers and loss of any of these customers could materially affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company has two major customers, each of which accounted for more than ten percent of consolidated gross sales in the Company\u2019s 2020 fiscal year. The Company also has several other large customers, none of which represent more than ten percent of consolidated gross sales, and historically has derived substantial revenues from these customers. Our customers continue to experience industry consolidation, which increases our risk that we may be unable to find sufficient alternative customers. The Company needs to continue to expand its customer base to minimize the effects of the loss of any single customer in the future. If sales to one or more of the large customers would be lost or materially reduced, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to replace such revenues, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s customers may experience financial difficulties that could result in losses to the Company.\nFrom time to time, one or more of the Company\u2019s customers have experienced, are experiencing, or may in the future experience financial difficulties that impair their ability to pay all amounts owed to the Company. In such instances, the customer may file bankruptcy or take other actions to restructure the amounts owed to secured and unsecured creditors, including unsecured trade creditors such as the Company. When this occurs, the Company may not be able to collect the full amount owed to it by the customer, and in severe situations may have to write off all or a substantial portion of those customer receivables. Any significant resulting losses incurred by the Company relating to these or other customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operation, and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s business may be adversely affected by the actions of and risks associated with third-party suppliers.\nThe raw materials that the Company purchases for manufacturing operations and many of the products that it sells are sourced from a wide variety of third-party suppliers. The Company cannot control the supply, design, function or cost of many of the products that are offered for sale and are dependent on the availability and pricing of key materials and products. Disruptions in the availability of raw materials used in production of these products may adversely affect sales and result in customer dissatisfaction. In addition, global sourcing of many of the products sold is an important factor in the Company\u2019s financial performance. The ability to find qualified suppliers and to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge, especially with respect to goods sourced outside the United States. Political instability, financial instability of suppliers, merchandise quality issues, trade restrictions, tariffs, currency exchange rates, transport capacity and costs, inflation and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond the Company\u2019s control.\nHistorically, instability in the political and economic environments of the countries in which the Company or its suppliers obtain products and raw materials has not had a material adverse effect on operations. However, the Company cannot predict the effect that future changes in economic or political conditions in the United States and in such foreign countries may have on operations. In the event of disruptions or delays in supply due to economic or political conditions, such disruptions or delays could adversely affect results of operations unless and until alternative supply arrangements could be made. In addition, products and materials purchased from alternative sources may be of lesser quality or more expensive than the products and materials currently purchased abroad.\nDeterioration in relationships with suppliers or in the financial condition of suppliers could adversely affect liquidity, results of operations and financial position.\nAccess to materials, parts and supplies is dependent upon close relationships with suppliers and the ability to purchase products from the principal suppliers on competitive terms. The Company does not enter into long-term supply contracts with these suppliers, and has no current plans to do so in the future. These suppliers are not required to sell to the Company and are free to change the prices and other terms. Any deterioration or change in the relationships with or in the financial condition of the Company\u2019s significant suppliers could have an adverse impact on its ability to procure materials and parts necessary to produce products for sale and distribution. If any of the significant suppliers terminated or significantly curtailed its relationship with the Company or ceased operations, the Company would be forced to expand relationships with other suppliers, seek out new relationships with new suppliers or risk a loss in market share due to diminished product offerings and availability. Any change in one or more of these suppliers\u2019 willingness or ability to continue to supply the Company with their products could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s liquidity, results of operations and financial position.\nDisruptions to our supply chain could have an adverse impact on our operations.\nMany of the Company\u2019s products are manufactured outside the United States. Those products must be transported by third parties over large geographic distances. Delays in the shipment or delivery of our products could occur due to work stoppages, port strikes, lack of availability of transportation, and other factors beyond the Company\u2019s control. The Company currently is experiencing increased shipping costs for products obtained from overseas due to a shortage of available shipping containers. If the Company experiences any significant disruption in its supply chain or sharply rising costs, for any reason, such as the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, the Company may be unable to satisfy customer demand for our products resulting in lost sales. Such delays and increased costs could impair our ability to timely and efficiently deliver our products, and could adversely impact our operating results.\nIntellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of products.\nThe Company obtains patents, trademarks and copyrights for intellectual property, including its brand names, which represent important assets to the Company. If the Company fails to adequately protect intellectual property through patents, trademarks and copyrights, its intellectual property rights may be misappropriated by others, invalidated or challenged, and our competitors could duplicate the Company\u2019s products or may otherwise limit any competitive design or manufacturing advantages. The Company believes that success is likely to depend upon continued innovation, technical expertise, marketing skills, branding, customer support and services rather than on legal protection of intellectual property rights. However, the Company intends to aggressively assert its intellectual property rights when necessary.\nThe expiration or termination of our material trademarks, brand names and licensing agreements could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company has invested substantial resources in developing and marketing the Company\u2019s brands and products over many years. The expiration or termination of one or more of the Company\u2019s material trademarks, patents or licensing agreements could result in the loss of such intellectual property. In such event, the Company may not be able to recoup its investments in, and continue to benefit from the affected brand names or products. The loss of such intellectual property and related rights could have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nBreaches of data or technology security could damage the Company\u2019s reputation, cause the Company to incur additional expense, expose the Company to litigation, and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nA breach of our data or technology security could result in an unauthorized transfer or release of Company proprietary, employee, customer and other Company related information, or the loss of valuable business data or technology, that could cause a disruption in our business. Hackers are increasingly sophisticated and operate large scale and complex cyber security attacks. In the event of such an attack, we may expend significant capital and other resources to protect against, respond to, and/or alleviate problems caused by a breach. Such an event could also result in unwanted negative media attention, damage to the Company\u2019s reputation, damage to our customers, and result in lost sales and lawsuits. The Company also must comply with increasingly complex regulatory cyber security and privacy standards, which can be costly and negatively impact the Company\u2019s profitability.\nUnauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential customer information could harm the Company\u2019s business and its standing with its customers.\nThrough sales and marketing activities, the Company collects and stores certain information that customers provide to purchase products or services or otherwise communicate and interact with the Company. Despite instituted safeguards for the protection of such information, the Company cannot be certain that all of its systems are entirely free from vulnerability to attack. Computer hackers may attempt to penetrate the Company\u2019s network security and, if successful, misappropriate confidential customer or business information. In addition, an employee, a contractor or other third party with whom the Company does business may attempt to circumvent the Company\u2019s security measures in order to obtain such information or inadvertently cause a breach involving such information. Loss of customer or business information could disrupt operations, damage the Company\u2019s reputation, and expose the Company to claims from customers, financial institutions, payment card associations and other persons, any of which could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, compliance with tougher privacy and information security laws and standards may result in significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes.\nCybersecurity breaches or other data security incidents could result in unauthorized access, theft, modification, or destruction of Company assets, including bank accounts, intellectual property, and confidential information, which may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company has experienced an increase in cybersecurity threats and attempts to breach the Company\u2019s security networks. The techniques used to conduct cyber attacks, including phishing, hacking, and malicious software, are increasingly sophisticated and the sources and targets of these attacks change frequently. Cyber attacks may not be recognized until after attacks have been launched successfully or have been in place for a period of time. From time to time, the Company has been, and likely will continue to be, the target of cyber and other security threats. To the Company\u2019s knowledge, the Company has not experienced a significant cybersecurity breach that had a material impact on the Company\u2019s business or operating results, although there can be no assurance that the Company\u2019s efforts to maintain the security of the Company\u2019s information technology networks and related systems will be effective or that attempted security breaches will not be damaging in the future. The Company maintains cyber liability insurances, however, such insurance may not be sufficient to cover the financial, legal, business or reputational losses that could result from a breach of the Company\u2019s systems.\nThe market price of the Company\u2019s common stock is likely to be highly volatile as the stock market in general can be highly volatile.\nThe public trading of the Company\u2019s common stock is based on many factors which could cause fluctuation in the Company\u2019s stock price. These factors may include, among other things:\n\u25cf\nGeneral economic and market conditions;\n\u25cf\nActual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results;\n\u25cf\nLimited research coverage by securities analysts;\n\u25cf\nRelatively low market capitalization resulting in low trading volume in the Company\u2019s stock;\n\u25cf\nIf securities analysts provide coverage, our inability to meet or exceed securities analysts' estimates or expectations;\n\u25cf\nConditions or trends in the Company\u2019s industries;\n\u25cf\nChanges in the market valuations of other companies in the Company\u2019s industries;\n\u25cf\nAnnouncements by the Company or the Company\u2019s competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, divestitures, joint ventures or other strategic initiatives;\n\u25cf\nCapital commitments;\n\u25cf\nAdditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u25cf\nTariffs, quotas, customs, import and export restrictions, and other trade barriers;\n\u25cf\nGlobal events, including acts or threats of war or terrorism, international conflicts, political instability, natural disasters, and public health crises;\n\u25cf\nSales and repurchases of the Company\u2019s common stock; and\n\u25cf\nThe ability to maintain listing of the Company\u2019s common stock on the NASDAQ Global Market.\nMany of these factors are beyond the Company\u2019s control. These factors may cause the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock to decline, regardless of operating performance.\nIf we are unable to pay quarterly dividends at intended levels, our reputation and stock price may be harmed.\nOur quarterly cash dividend is currently $0.14 per common share. The dividend program requires the use of a portion of our cash flow. Our ability to pay dividends will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future. This ability may be subject to certain economic, financial, competitive and other factors that are beyond our control. Our Board of Directors (Board) may, at its discretion, increase or decrease the intended level of dividends or entirely discontinue the payment of dividends at any time. Any failure to pay dividends after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation, investor confidence in us and negatively impact our stock price.\nRISKS OF INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS\nInternational operations expose the Company to the unique risks inherent in foreign operations.\nThe Company has manufacturing operations in Mexico and sources many of its products and raw materials from China and other Asian countries. Foreign operations encounter risks similar to those faced by U.S. operations, as well as risks inherent in foreign operations, such as local customs and regulatory constraints, control over product quality and content, foreign trade policies, competitive conditions, foreign currency fluctuations and unstable political and economic conditions. Additionally, our international operations may be adversely affected by political events, domestic or international terrorist events and hostilities, complications due to natural, nuclear or other disasters, or public health crises. For instance, recent government changes in Mexico have yielded requirements that call for increases in minimum wages at the border as well as the interior of Mexico. In addition, beginning in 2020 and continuing into 2021, the ongoing coronavirus outbreak has resulted in increased travel restrictions and extended shutdown of certain businesses in Mexico, China and other countries in which the Company does business or has suppliers. These or any further political or governmental developments or health concerns in locations in which the Company conducts business could result in social, economic and labor instability. These uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on the continuity of the Company\u2019s operations and on the Company\u2019s income and profitability.\nThe Company\u2019s business is subject to risks associated with sourcing and manufacturing outside of the United States, and risks arising from tariffs and/or international trade wars.\nThe Company imports many of its raw materials and finished goods from countries outside of the United States, including but not limited to China and Mexico. The Company\u2019s ability to import products in a timely and cost-effective manner may be affected by conditions, such as public health crises, labor disputes, political unrest, and security requirements of the U.S. and other countries that could delay importation of products or require us to locate alternative sources. Our import operations are subject to complex custom laws, regulations, tax requirements, and trade regulations, such as tariffs set by governments through mutual agreements or bilateral actions. U.S. tariffs on goods imported into the U.S., particularly goods from China, have increased the cost of goods purchased by the Company and the ongoing adverse effects of such tariffs potentially could become even more severe. The overall effect of these risks is that our costs may increase, which in turn may result in lower profitability if we are unable to offset such increases through higher prices, and/or that we may suffer a decline in sales if our customers do not accept price increases.\nThe United States, Mexico and Canada have entered into the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (\"USMCA\"), the successor agreement to the North American Free Trade Agreement (\"NAFTA\") which became effective on July 1, 2020. In January 2020, the United States entered into a \"Phase 1\" trade agreement with China. However, it remains unclear what the U.S. administration or foreign governments, including China, specifically will or will not do with respect to tariffs, the USMCA or other international trade agreements and policies. A trade war, other governmental action related to tariffs or international trade agreements, changes in U.S. social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade, manufacturing, development and investment in the territories and countries where we currently manufacture and sell products or any resulting negative sentiments towards the United States could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nSubstantially all of our import operations are subject to customs and tax requirements as well as trade regulations, such as tariffs and quotas set by governments through mutual agreements or bilateral actions. In addition, the countries in which our products are manufactured or imported may from time to time impose additional quotas, duties, tariffs or other restrictions on our imports or adversely modify existing restrictions. Adverse changes in these import costs and restrictions, or our suppliers' failure to comply with customs regulations or similar laws, could harm our business. In this regard, possible changes in U.S. policies and the potential effects of Brexit have introduced greater uncertainty with respect to future tax and trade regulations. Changes in tax policy or trade regulations, such as the disallowance of tax deductions on imported merchandise or the imposition of new tariffs on imported products, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur operations are also subject to the effects of international trade agreements and regulations that impose requirements that could adversely affect our business, such as setting quotas on products that may be imported from a particular country.\nThe Company could be adversely affected by changes in currency exchange rates and/or the value of the United States dollar.\nThe Company is exposed to risks related to the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the value of the United States dollar. Changes in currency exchange rates and the value of the United States dollar can have a significant impact on earnings. While the Company carefully watches fluctuations in currency exchange rates, these types of changes can have material adverse effects on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nCOVID-19 PANDEMIC RISKS\nThe COVID-19 pandemic currently is affecting the Company\u2019s business. Additional factors could exacerbate such consequences and/or cause materially adverse effects.\nWhile the COVID-19 pandemic did not materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial results and business operations in the Company\u2019s fiscal year ended December 26, 2020, economic and health conditions in the United States and across most of the globe changed rapidly during 2020. In the short-term, demand for the Company\u2019s products has increased, notably in our fitness products and also in basketball, playground, and indoor/outdoor games. Some of the increase in demand is likely due to consumers being required or encouraged by governmental authorities to stay at home, schools being closed, and employers requiring employees to work remotely and/or implementing furloughs and layoffs. Such increased demand may not continue and/or demand may decrease from historical levels depending on the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, the length of time it takes for normal economic and operating conditions to resume, additional governmental actions that may be taken and/or extensions of time for restrictions that have been imposed to date, and numerous other uncertainties. During 2020, such restrictions at times caused the Company to shut down its Mexico production facilities, to limit its Gainesville, Florida facility to conduct only shipping and receiving operations but no manufacturing operations, to require all office staff to work remotely, and to change staffing of the Company\u2019s distribution center in Evansville, Indiana. While the Company has largely resumed normal operations in such facilities subject to increased health protocols having been implemented, most of the Company\u2019s office staff continue to work remotely. The ongoing pandemic may result in future business and manufacturing disruption, inventory shortages, delivery delays, and reduced sales and operations, any of which could materially affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe ability of the Company\u2019s employees to work may be significantly impacted by the coronavirus.\nThe Company\u2019s employees are being affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Virtually all of our office and management personnel continue to work remotely. Travel restrictions imposed by the U.S. government and of foreign countries, particularly China and Mexico have limited, or in some cases prohibited, normal business travel relating to the Company\u2019s internal operations and to our ongoing business relationships with our customers and suppliers. The health of the Company\u2019s workforce is of primary concern and the Company may need to continue indefinitely existing precautionary measures, and possibly enact additional measures, to help minimize the risk of our employees being exposed to the coronavirus. Further, our management team continues to focus on mitigating the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has required and will continue to require a large investment of time and resources across the entire Company, thereby potentially diverting their attention from other priorities that existed prior to the outbreak of the pandemic. If these conditions worsen, or last for an extended period of time, the Company\u2019s ability to manage its business may be impaired, and operational risks, cybersecurity risks and other risks facing the Company even prior to the pandemic may be elevated.\nThe Company cannot predict the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its customers, suppliers, vendors, and other business partners.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is affecting the Company\u2019s customers, suppliers, vendors, and other business partners, but the Company is not able to assess the full extent of the current impact nor predict the ultimate consequences that will result therefrom. Although Amazon, the Company\u2019s largest customer, has performed well throughout the pandemic, it remains to be seen if consumer demand for online purchasers will continue unabated and/or permanently change the way in which consumers make purchasing decisions. Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods, the Company\u2019s second largest customer, and many of the Company\u2019s other mass merchant customers have experienced increased online orders and reduced foot traffic into their physical stores. In general, many retailers are experiencing severe financial difficulties and bankruptcies. If those trends continue for the long-term, the Company\u2019s strategies in distributing and marketing its products will need to change accordingly. The Company\u2019s planning and efforts in recent years to position itself to ship many goods purchased on Amazon or other online sources direct to consumers and for the Company to make direct to consumer online sales may mitigate some, but not all, of the adverse effects resulting from changes in the businesses of the Company\u2019s resellers. If the Company\u2019s sales channels are substantially impaired for an extended period of time or fail to adapt to changing consumer preferences, the Company\u2019s sales will be materially reduced.\nThe ultimate magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic is unpredictable, volatile and uncertain.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has created significant public health concerns and economic disruption and may continue to do so indefinitely. While the Company experienced substantial increases in sales and order activity in its 2020 fiscal year, due in part to increased consumer demand for home recreational products during the pandemic, we cannot predict the full impact of the pandemic nor can we predict with any certainty whether and to what degree the disruptions caused by the pandemic and reactions thereto will continue. Much is unknown, including the duration and severity of the pandemic, the amount of time it may take for more normalized economic activity to resume, future government actions that may be taken, the effects on the Company\u2019s customers and suppliers, including their ability to pay for our products, the effects on operations of the Company\u2019s logistics providers, and the impact on the ability of the Company\u2019s employees to work and travel. Continuing and potential new governmental actions may further cause the Company to modify its business operations or otherwise adversely impact the Company. While the Company has taken numerous steps to mitigate the potential negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to respond quickly enough or appropriately to circumstances that may change rapidly and/or that are outside of our control. The long-term impact of the pandemic on the Company\u2019s business is unknown and ultimately could result in material adverse effects on the Company\u2019s business, financial performance and results of operations.\nLEGAL, TAX, ACCOUNTING AND REGULATORY RISKS\nThe Company is subject to risks associated with laws and regulations related to health, safety and environmental protection.\nProducts, and the production and distribution of products, are subject to a variety of laws and regulations relating to health, safety and environmental protection. Laws and regulations relating to health, safety and environmental protection have been passed in several jurisdictions in which the Company operates in the United States and abroad. Although the Company does not anticipate any material adverse effects based on the nature of operations and the thrust of such laws, there is no assurance such existing laws or future laws will not have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nNew laws, policies, regulations, rulemaking and oversight, as well as changes to those currently in effect, could adversely impact our earnings, cash flows and operations.\nOur assets and operations are subject to regulation and oversight by federal, state, and local regulatory authorities. Legislative changes, as well as regulatory actions taken by these agencies, have the potential to adversely affect our profitability. In addition, a certain degree of regulatory uncertainty is created by the U.S. political climate. It remains unclear specifically what the changes in presidential administration and Congress may do with respect to future policies and regulations that may affect us. Regulation affects many aspects of our business and extends to such matters as (i) federal, state, and local taxation; (ii) rates (which include tax, commodity, surcharges and fuel); (iii) the integrity, safety and security of facilities and operations; (iv) the acquisition of other businesses; (v) the acquisition, extension, disposition or abandonment of services or facilities; (vi) reporting and information requirements; and (vii) the maintenance of accounts and records.\nThe preparation of the Company\u2019s financial statements requires the use of estimates that may vary from actual results.\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make significant estimates that may affect financial statements. Due to the inherent nature of making estimates, actual results may vary substantially from such estimates, which could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. For more information on the Company\u2019s critical accounting estimates, please see the Critical Accounting Estimates section of this Form 10-K.\nChanges in accounting standards could impact reported earnings and financial condition.\nThe accounting standard setters, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission, periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements. These changes can be hard to predict and apply and can materially affect how the Company records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, the Company could be required to apply a new or revised standard retrospectively, which may result in the restatement of prior period financial statements.\nMACROECONOMIC AND GENERAL BUSINESS RISKS\nOperating results may be impacted by changes in the economy that influence business and consumer spending.\nOperating results are directly impacted by the health of the North American and to a lesser extent, European and Asian economies. We cannot predict how robust the economy will be or whether or not it will be sustained. If economic recovery is slow to occur, or if the economy experiences a prolonged period of decelerating or negative growth, the Company\u2019s results of operations may be negatively impacted. In general, the Company\u2019s sales depend on discretionary spending by consumers. Business and financial performance may be adversely affected by current and future economic conditions, including unemployment levels, energy costs, interest rates, recession, inflation, the impact of natural disasters and terrorist activities, public health crisis, and other matters that influence business and consumer spending.\nFluctuation in economic conditions could prevent the Company from accurately forecasting demand for its products which could adversely affect its operating results or market share.\nFluctuation in economic conditions and market instability in the United States and globally makes it difficult for the Company, customers and suppliers to accurately forecast future product demand trends, which could cause the Company to produce excess products that can increase inventory carrying costs and result in obsolete inventory. Alternatively, this forecasting difficulty could cause a shortage of products, or materials used in products, that could result in an inability to satisfy demand for products and a loss of market share.\nFailure to sustain a continuing economic recovery in the United States and elsewhere could have a substantial adverse effect on our business.\nOur business is tied to general economic and industry conditions as demand for sporting goods depends largely on the strength of the economy, employment levels, consumer confidence levels and the availability and cost of credit. These factors have had and could continue to have a substantial impact on our business.\nCertain political developments in recent years have provided increased economic uncertainty. The United Kingdom formally exited the European Union on January 31, 2020 (\u201cBrexit\u201d), and entered into a new trade agreement with the European Union on December 24, 2020. The United Kingdom may set its own trade policies with countries such as the United States, Australia and New Zealand that currently do not have free trade agreements with the European Union. Although the Company may not be directly impacted by Brexit, these and future trade deals could subject the rest of the world to tariffs and duties set by the World Trade Organization, potentially resulting in higher import costs on the Company\u2019s products and raw materials. In addition, political conflicts in the U.S. could result in economic and trade policy actions that would impact economic conditions in various countries, the cost of importing into the U.S. and the competitive landscape of our customers, suppliers and competitors.\nAdverse global economic conditions could also cause our customers and suppliers to experience severe economic constraints in the future, including bankruptcy, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations.\nQuarterly operating results are subject to fluctuation.\nOperating results have fluctuated from quarter to quarter in the past, and the Company expects that they will continue to do so in the future. Factors that could cause these quarterly fluctuations include the following: international, national and local general economic and market conditions; the size and growth of the overall sporting goods markets; intense competition among manufacturers, marketers, distributors and sellers of products; demographic changes; changes in consumer preferences; popularity of particular designs, categories of products and sports; seasonal demand for products; adverse weather conditions that may create fluctuations in demand for certain of our products; the size, timing and mix of purchases of products; fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting operating results; ability to sustain, manage or forecast growth and inventories; new product development and introduction; ability to secure and protect trademarks, patents and other intellectual property; performance and reliability of products; customer service; the loss of significant customers or suppliers; dependence on distributors; business disruptions; disruptions or delays in our supply chain, including potential disruptions or delays arising from political unrest, war, labor strikes, natural disasters, and public heath crises such as the coronavirus pandemic; increased costs of freight and transportation to meet delivery deadlines; changes in business strategy or development plans; general risks associated with doing business outside the United States, including, without limitation: exchange rates, import duties, tariffs, quotas and political and economic instability; changes in government regulations; any liability and other claims asserted against the Company; ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; and other factors referenced or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K and any other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nTerrorist attacks, acts of war, natural disasters, and public health crises may seriously harm the Company\u2019s business.\nAmong the chief uncertainties facing the nation and the world and, as a result, our business, is the instability and conflict in the Middle East and uncertainties regarding North Korea, Russia, China and other Asian and European countries. Obviously, no one can predict with certainty what the overall economic impact will be as a result of these circumstances. Terrorist attacks may cause damage or disruption to the Company, employees, facilities and customers, which could significantly impact net sales, costs and expenses and financial condition. The potential for future terrorist attacks, the national and international responses to terrorist attacks, and other acts of war and hostility may cause greater uncertainty and cause business to suffer in ways the Company currently cannot predict.\nIn addition, any natural disaster or other serious disruption to one of the Company\u2019s manufacturing or distribution sites due to fire, tornado, earthquake or other natural disasters in countries where the Company conducts business, or political unrest, war, labor strikes, work stoppages or public health crises, such as outbreaks of the coronavirus in countries where our suppliers are located could result in the disruption of the Company\u2019s shipments and supply chain of products and raw materials. Although we have continued to obtain product shipments from China notwithstanding the coronavirus pandemic, product shipments from China may be delayed in the future. Although we are monitoring the situation and have adapted our ordering practices in our attempt to minimize the effects of potential disruptions, the Company cannot predict whether, for how long, or the extent to which the pandemic may disrupt the Company\u2019s supply chain, manufacturing operations, and/or product shipments. Any significant disruption resulting from similar events on a large scale or over a prolonged period could cause significant delays until the Company would be able to resume normal operations or shift to other third party suppliers, if needed. There can be no assurance that alternative capacity could be obtained on favorable terms, if at all, and could negatively affect the Company\u2019s sales and profitability.\nThese risks are not exhaustive.\nOther sections of this Form 10-K may include additional factors which could adversely impact the Company\u2019s business and financial performance. Moreover, the Company operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all risk factors, nor can the Company assess the impact of all factors on business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results.", "PERMNO": 33532, "SIC": 3949, "TIC": "ESCA"}
