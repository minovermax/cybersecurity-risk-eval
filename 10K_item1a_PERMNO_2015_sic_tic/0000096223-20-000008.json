{"cik": "96223", "company": "Jefferies Financial Group Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-01-29", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors.\nOur business is subject to a number of risks. You should carefully consider the following risk factors, together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this report, before you decide whether to purchase our securities. The risks set out below are not the only risks we face. In addition to the specific risks mentioned in this report, we may also be affected by other factors that affect businesses generally such as global or regional changes in economic, business or political conditions, acts of war, terrorism, climate change or natural disasters. If any of such risks occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nWe have also set forth certain specific risks associated with certain of our investments. The inclusion or non-inclusion of these risks for specific investments should not be interpreted to mean that a mentioned or non-mentioned investment is more or less important or material than another. Additionally, some of our investments are in securities of issuers that file reports with the SEC. You should also carefully consider the additional risks disclosed by those issuers with the SEC as those risks may also impact your investment in our securities.\nFuture acquisitions and dispositions of our businesses and investments are possible, changing the components of our assets and liabilities, and if unsuccessful or unfavorable, could reduce the value of our securities. Any future acquisitions or dispositions may result in significant changes in the composition of our assets and liabilities, as well as our business mix and prospects. Consequently, our financial condition, results of operations and the trading price of our securities may be affected by factors different from those affecting our financial condition, results of operations and trading price at the present time.\nWe face numerous risks and uncertainties as we expand our business. We expect the growth and development of our business to come primarily from internal expansion and through acquisitions, investments, and strategic partnering. As we expand our business, there can be no assurance that financial controls, the level and knowledge of personnel, operational abilities, legal and compliance controls and other corporate support systems and technology will be adequate to manage our business and growth. The ineffectiveness of any of these controls or systems could adversely affect our business and prospects. In addition, if we acquire new businesses and introduce new products, we face numerous risks and uncertainties integrating their controls and systems, including financial controls, accounting and data processing systems, management controls and other operations. A failure to integrate these systems and controls, and even an inefficient or non-secure integration of these systems and controls, could adversely affect our business and prospects.\nCertain business initiatives, including expansions of existing businesses, may bring us into contact directly or indirectly, with individuals and entities that are not within our traditional client and counterparty base and may expose us to new asset classes and new markets. These business activities expose us to new and enhanced risks, greater regulatory scrutiny of these activities, increased credit-related, sovereign and operational risks, and reputational concerns regarding the manner in which these assets are being operated or held.\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations are dependent upon those of our individual businesses, and our aggregate investments in particular industries. We are a holding company with investments in businesses and assets in a number of industries. Jefferies Group is our largest investment and we have significant additional investments in the financial services industry. Our business, financial condition and results of operations are dependent upon our various businesses and investments. Any material adverse change in one of our businesses or investments, or in a particular industry in which we operate or invest, may cause material adverse changes to our business, financial condition and results of operations. The more capital we devote to a particular investment or industry may increase the risk that such investment could significantly impact our financial condition and results of operations, possibly in a material adverse way.\nConditions in the financial markets and the economy may adversely impact our businesses and investments. These include economic conditions that may be specific to the industries in which our businesses and investments operate, as well as a general economic slowdown, prolonged recession or other market downturn or disruption. Adverse impacts may include the following:\n\u2022\nA market downturn could lead to a decline in client and customer activity levels, and therefore a decline in services provided, causing reduced revenues from fees, commissions, spreads and other forms of revenue.\n\u2022\nAdverse changes in the market could lead to decreases in the value of our holdings, both realized and unrealized.\n\u2022\nAdverse changes in the market could also lead to a reduction in revenues from asset management fees and investment income from managed funds. The build out of our asset management business could also be impacted as adverse conditions could lead to a decrease in new capital raised and may cause investors to withdraw their investments and commitments. Even in the absence of a market downturn, below-market investment performance by funds and portfolio\nmanagers could reduce asset management revenues and assets under management and result in reputational damage that might make it more difficult to attract new investors.\n\u2022\nLimitations on the availability of credit, such as occurred during 2008, can affect the ability of our businesses and investments to borrow on a secured or unsecured basis, which may adversely affect liquidity and results of operations. Global market and economic conditions have been particularly disrupted and volatile in the last several years and may be in the future. Cost and availability of funding could be affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads.\n\u2022\nCertain of our current and future businesses and investments may require additional third-party funding to succeed, such as venture capital funding, joint venture funding or other third-party capital. Failure to obtain such third-party funding may cause such business, investment or prospective investment to fail or progress slower than expected which could adversely affect its and our funding, liquidity, operations and profitability. In addition, such failure could also adversely affect our reputation which could adversely affect our business and future business prospects.\n\u2022\nAdditional changes in tax law could impact our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets, decrease current and anticipated cash flows, or prompt revisions to compensation arrangements.\n\u2022\nShould one or more of the competitors of our businesses or investments fail, business prospects and revenue could be negatively impacted due to negative market sentiment causing customers to cease doing business with, and lenders to cease extending credit to, our businesses and investments, which could adversely affect our operations, funding and liquidity.\n\u2022\nUnfavorable economic conditions could have an adverse effect on the demand for new loans and the servicing of loans originated by third parties, which would have an adverse impact on the operations and profitability of some of our financial services businesses and investments.\n\u2022\nUnfavorable conditions or changes in general political, economic or market conditions could adversely impact our business and prospects. In particular, the increasing trend toward sovereign protectionism and deglobalization resulting from the current populist political movement has resulted or could result in decreases in free trade, erosion of traditional international coalitions, the imposition of sanctions and tariffs, governmental closures and no-confidence votes, domestic and international strife, and general market upheaval in response to such results, all of which could negatively impact our business and prospects.\nWe are exposed to market risk. We are, directly and indirectly, affected by changes in market conditions. Market risk generally represents the risk that values of assets and liabilities or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions. For example, changes in interest rates could adversely affect our net interest spread, the difference between the yield we earn on our assets and the interest rate we pay for sources of funding, which, in turn, impacts our net interest revenue and earnings. Changes in interest rates could affect the interest earned on assets differently than interest paid on liabilities. In our brokerage operations, a rising interest rate environment generally results in our earning a larger net interest spread. Conversely, in those operations, a falling interest rate environment generally results in our earning a smaller net interest spread. If we are unable to effectively manage our interest rate risk, changes in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.\nMarket risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations and activities, including trading account assets and liabilities, loans, securities, short-term borrowings, corporate debt, and derivatives. Market conditions that change from time to time, thereby exposing us to market risk, include fluctuations in interest rates, equity prices, relative exchange rates, and price deterioration or changes in value due to changes in market perception or actual credit quality of an issuer.\nIn addition, disruptions in the liquidity or transparency of the financial markets may result in our inability to sell, syndicate, or realize the value of security positions, thereby leading to increased concentrations. The inability to reduce our positions in specific securities may not only increase the market and credit risks associated with such positions, but also increase the level of risk-weighted assets on our balance sheet, thereby increasing capital requirements, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nOur principal trading and investments expose us to risk of loss. A considerable portion of our revenues is derived from trading in which we act as principal. We may incur trading losses relating to the purchase, sale or short sale of fixed income, high-yield, international, convertible, and equity securities, loans and futures and commodities for our own account. In any period, we may experience losses on our positions as a result of price fluctuations, lack of trading volume, and illiquidity. From time to time, we may engage in a large block trade in a single security or maintain large position concentrations in a single security, securities of a single issuer, securities of issuers engaged in a specific industry, or securities from issuers located in a particular country or region. In general, because certain of our investments are marked to market on a daily basis, any adverse price movement in these investments could result in a reduction of our revenues and profits. In addition, we may engage in hedging transactions that if not successful, could result in losses.\nDamage to our reputation could damage our business. Maintaining our reputation is critical to our attracting and maintaining customers, investors and employees. If we fail to deal with, or appear to fail to deal with, various issues that may give rise to\nreputational risk, we could significantly harm our business prospects. These issues include, but are not limited to, any of the risks discussed in this Item 1A, appropriately dealing with potential conflicts of interest, legal and regulatory requirements, ethical issues, money-laundering, cybersecurity and privacy, record keeping, sales and trading practices, failure to sell securities we have underwritten at the anticipated price levels, and the proper identification of the legal, reputational, credit, liquidity and market risks inherent in our products. A failure to deliver appropriate standards of service and quality, or a failure or perceived failure to treat customers and clients fairly, can result in customer dissatisfaction, litigation and heightened regulatory scrutiny, all of which can lead to lost revenue, higher operating costs and harm to our reputation. Further, negative publicity regarding us, whether or not true, may also result in harm to our prospects. Our operations in the past have been impacted as some clients either ceased doing business or temporarily slowed down the level of business they do, thereby decreasing our revenue. There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully reverse the negative impact of allegations and rumors in the future and our potential failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and liquidity.\nWe may incur losses if our risk management is not effective. We seek to monitor and control our risk exposure. Our risk management processes and procedures are designed to limit our and certain of our subsidiaries' exposure to acceptable levels as we conduct our businesses. We and certain of our subsidiaries apply comprehensive frameworks of limits on a variety of key metrics to constrain the risk profile of our business activities. The size of the limits reflects risk tolerance for certain activities. The frameworks may include inventory position and exposure limits on a gross and net basis, scenario analysis and stress tests, value-at-risk, sensitivities, exposure concentrations, aged inventory, amount of Level 3 assets, counterparty exposure, leverage, cash capital, and performance analysis. While we and certain of our subsidiaries employ various risk monitoring and risk mitigation techniques, those techniques and the judgments that accompany their application, including risk tolerance determinations, cannot anticipate every economic and financial outcome or the specifics and timing of such outcomes. As a result, we may incur losses notwithstanding our risk management processes and procedures.\nOperational risks may disrupt our business, result in regulatory action against us or limit our growth. Our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process, on a daily basis, a large number of transactions across numerous and diverse markets in many currencies, and the transactions we process have become increasingly complex. If any of our financial, accounting or other data processing systems do not operate properly or are disabled or if there are other shortcomings or failures in our internal processes, people or systems, we could suffer an impairment to our liquidity, financial loss, a disruption of our businesses, liability to clients, regulatory intervention or reputational damage. These systems may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, including a disruption of electrical or communications services or our inability to occupy one or more of our buildings. The inability of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions could also constrain our ability to expand our businesses.\nCertain of our financial and other data processing systems rely on access to and the functionality of operating systems maintained by third parties. If the accounting, trading or other data processing systems on which we are dependent are unable to meet increasingly demanding standards for processing and security or, if they fail or have other significant shortcomings, we could be adversely affected. Such consequences may include our inability to effect transactions and manage our exposure to risk.\nIn addition, despite the contingency plans we and certain of our subsidiaries have in place, our ability to conduct business may be adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses and the communities in which they are located. This may include a disruption involving electrical, communications, transportation or other services used by us or third parties with which we conduct business.\nWe rely on the security of our information technology systems and those of our third party providers to protect our proprietary information and information of our customers. Some of our businesses involve the storage and transmission of customers' personal and/or identifying information, consumer preferences and credit card information. While we believe that we have implemented protective measures to effectively secure information and prevent security breaches, and we continue to assess and improve these measures, our information technology systems have been and may continue to be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer hacking, computer viruses or other unauthorized attempts by third parties to access the proprietary information of our customers. Information technology breaches and failures could disrupt our ability to function in the normal course of business resulting in lost revenue, the disclosure or modification of sensitive or confidential information and the incurrence of remediation and notification costs, resulting in legal and financial exposure. Moreover, loss of confidential customer identification information could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under laws that protect confidential personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenues.\nOur information and technology systems are critical components of our business and operations, and a failure of those systems or other aspects of our operations infrastructure may disrupt our business, cause financial loss, increase our legal liability and constrain our growth. Our operations rely extensively on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential financial, personal and other information in our computer systems and networks. Although we take protective measures and devote significant\nresources to maintaining and upgrading our systems and networks with measures such as intrusion and detection prevention systems, monitoring firewalls to safeguard critical business applications and supervising third party providers that have access to our systems, our computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses or other malicious code, and other events that could have a security impact. Additionally, if a client's computer system, network or other technology is compromised by unauthorized access, we may face losses or other adverse consequences by unknowingly entering into unauthorized transactions. If one or more of such events occur, this potentially could jeopardize our or our clients' or counterparties' confidential and other information processed and stored in and transmitted through our computer systems and networks. Furthermore, such events may cause interruptions or malfunctions in our, our clients', our counterparties' or third parties' operations, including the transmission and execution of unauthorized transactions. We may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures, and we may be subject to litigation and financial losses that are either not covered or not fully covered through our insurance. The increased use of smartphones, tablets and other mobile devices as well as cloud computing may also heighten these and other operational risks. Similar to other firms, we and our third party providers continue to be the subject of attempted unauthorized access, computer viruses and malware, and cyber attacks designed to disrupt or degrade service or cause other damage and denial of service. Additional challenges are posed by external parties, including foreign state actors. There can be no assurance that such unauthorized access or cyber incidents will not occur in the future, and they could occur more frequently and on a larger scale.\nWe are also subject to laws and regulations relating to the privacy of the information of our clients, employees or others, and any failure to comply with these regulations could expose us to liability and/or reputational damage. In addition, our businesses are increasingly subject to laws and regulations relating to surveillance, encryption and data on-shoring in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Compliance with these laws and regulations may require us to change our policies, procedures and technology for information security, which could, among other things, make us more vulnerable to cyber attacks and misappropriation, corruption or loss of information or technology.\nAny cyber attack or other security breach of or vulnerability in our technology systems, or those of our clients or other third-party vendors we rely on, could have operational impacts, subject us to significant liability and harm our reputation. Our operations rely heavily on the secure processing, storage and transmission of sensitive and confidential financial, personal and other information in our computer systems and networks. There have been several highly publicized cases involving financial services companies reporting the unauthorized disclosure of client or other confidential information in recent years, as well as cyber attacks involving theft, dissemination and destruction of corporate information or other assets, in some cases as a result of failure to follow procedures by employees or contractors or as a result of actions by third parties. Like other financial services firms, we have been the target of attempted cyber attacks. Cyber attacks can originate from a variety of sources, including third parties affiliated with foreign governments, organized crime or terrorist organizations. Third parties may also attempt to place individuals within our firm or induce employees, clients or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information or provide access to our data, and these types of risks may be difficult to detect or prevent. Although cybersecurity incidents among financial services firms are on the rise, we are not aware of any material losses relating to cyber attacks or other information security breaches. However, the techniques used in these attacks are increasingly sophisticated, change frequently and are often not recognized until launched. Although we seek to maintain a robust suite of authentication and layered information security controls, these controls could fail to detect, mitigate or remediate these risks in a timely manner. Despite our implementation of protective measures and endeavoring to modify them as circumstances warrant, our computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to human error, natural disasters, power loss, spam attacks, unauthorized access, distributed denial of service attacks, computer viruses and other malicious code, and other events that could result in significant liability and damage to our reputation, and have an ongoing impact on the security and stability of our operations.\nWe also rely on numerous third-party service providers to conduct other aspects of our business operations, and we face similar risks relating to them. While we regularly conduct security assessments on these third-party vendors, we cannot be certain that their information security protocols are sufficient to withstand a cyber attack or other security breach. In addition, in order to access our products and services, our customers may use computers and other devices that are beyond our security control systems and processes.\nNotwithstanding the precautions we take, if a cyber attack or other information security breach were to occur, this could jeopardize the information we confidentially maintain, or otherwise cause interruptions in our operations or those of our clients and counterparties, exposing us to liability. As attempted attacks continue to evolve in scope and sophistication, we may be required to expend substantial additional resources to modify or enhance our protective measures, to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures or to communicate about cyber attacks to our customers. Though we have insurance against some cyber risks and attacks, we may be subject to litigation and financial losses that exceed our policy limits or are not covered under any of our current insurance policies. A technological breakdown could also interfere with our ability to comply with financial reporting and other regulatory requirements, exposing us to potential disciplinary action by regulators. Additionally, the SEC issued guidance in February 2018 stating that, as a public company, we are expected to have controls and procedures that relate to cybersecurity\ndisclosure, and are required to disclose information relating to certain cyber attacks or other information security breaches in disclosures required to be made under the federal securities laws. Further, successful cyber attacks at other large financial institutions or other market participants, whether or not we are affected, could lead to a general loss of customer confidence in financial institutions that could negatively affect us, including harming the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures or the financial system in general, which could result in a loss of business.\nFurther, in light of the high volume of transactions we process, the large number of our clients, partners and counterparties, and the increasing sophistication of malicious actors, a cyber attack could occur and persist for an extended period of time without detection. We expect that any investigation of a cyber attack would take substantial amounts of time and resources, and that there may be extensive delays before we obtain full and reliable information. During such time we would not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it, and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered. All of which would further increase the costs and consequences of such an attack.\nWe may also be subject to liability under various data protection laws. In providing services to clients, we manage, utilize and store sensitive or confidential client or employee data, including personal data. As a result, we are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect this information, such as U.S. federal, state and international laws governing the protection of personally identifiable information. These laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number. If any person, including any of our associates, negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to client or employee data, or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates such data, we could be subject to significant monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions, fines and/or criminal prosecution. In addition, unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or employee data, whether through system failure, employee negligence, fraud or misappropriation, could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients and related revenue. Potential liability in the event of a security breach of client data could be significant. Depending on the circumstances giving rise to the breach, this liability may not be subject to a contractual limit or an exclusion of consequential or indirect damages.\nRecent legislation and new and pending regulation may significantly affect our businesses and investments. In recent years, there has been significant legislation and increased regulation affecting the financial services industry. In addition, there has also been recent discussions of proposed legislative and regulatory changes that would also affect the financial services industry. These legislative and regulatory initiatives affect not only us (particularly Jefferies Group, Berkadia and FXCM) but also our competitors and certain of our clients and customers. These changes could have an effect on our revenue and profitability, limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities, impact the value of assets that we hold, require us to change certain business practices, impose additional costs on us and otherwise adversely affect our business. Accordingly, we cannot provide assurance that legislation and regulation will not eventually have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nExtensive regulation of our businesses limits our activities, and, if we violate these regulations, we may be subject to significant penalties. The financial services industry is subject to extensive laws, rules and regulations in every country in which they operate. Firms that engage in providing financial services must comply with the laws, rules and regulations imposed by national and state governments and regulatory and self-regulatory bodies with jurisdiction over such activities. Such laws, rules and regulations cover many aspects of providing financial services.\nRegulators supervise certain of Jefferies Group's business activities to monitor compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations. In addition, if there are instances in which our regulators question our compliance with laws, rules, or regulations, they may investigate the facts and circumstances to determine whether we have complied. At any moment in time, we may be subject to one or more such investigation or similar review. At this time, all such investigations and similar reviews are insignificant in scope and immaterial to us. However, there can be no assurance that, in the future, we will not violate such laws, rules, or regulations, or that such investigations and similar reviews will not result in significant or material adverse regulatory requirements, regulatory enforcement actions, fines or other adverse impact to the operation of our business.\nAdditionally, violations of laws, rules and regulations could subject us to one or more of the following events: civil and criminal liability; sanctions, which could include the revocation of registrations as registered financial service firms (including registered investment advisers or broker-dealers); the revocation of the licenses of our financial advisers; censures; fines; or a temporary suspension or permanent bar from conducting business. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and prospects.\nCertain of our subsidiaries are subject to regulatory financial capital holding requirements, such as the Net Capital Rule, that could impact various capital allocation decisions or limit the operations of its broker-dealers. In particular, compliance with the Net Capital Rule may restrict a broker-dealers' ability to engage in capital-intensive activities such as underwriting and trading, and may also limit their ability to make loans, advances, dividends and other payments.\nAdditional legislation, changes in rules, changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules, conflicts and inconsistencies among rules and regulations, or the entering into businesses that subject us to new rules and regulations may directly affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We continue to monitor the impact of new U.S. and international regulation on our businesses.\nThe United Kingdom's exit from the European Union (\"EU\") could adversely affect our businesses and investments. In March 2017, the then Prime Minister of the U.K. notified the European Council, in accordance with Article 50(2) of the Treaty on EU, of the U.K.'s intention to withdraw from the EU (such withdrawal commonly being referred to as \"Brexit\"). The completion of Brexit has been postponed; and it is possible that Brexit will not occur. There is uncertainty as to the scope, nature and terms of the relationship between the U.K. and the EU after Brexit (if it occurs). The uncertainty surrounding the timing, terms and consequences of Brexit could adversely impact customer and investor confidence, result in additional market volatility and adversely affect Jefferies Group, FXCM and our other businesses with operations or customers in Europe.\nJefferies Group operates substantial parts of its EU businesses from entities based in the U.K. Following Brexit (if it occurs), the regulatory and legal environment that would then exist, and to which its U.K. operations would then be subject, will depend on, in certain respects, the nature of the arrangements (if any) that the U.K. may agree with the EU and other trading partners. While there is ongoing uncertainty, Jefferies Group has taken steps to ensure that it is able to continue to provide services to clients located in the European Economic Area (\"EEA\") jurisdiction without interruption, even in the event of a \"hard\" Brexit occurring. As such, a Jefferies Group wholly-owned subsidiary, Jefferies GmbH, has been established in Germany which is authorized as a MiFID investment firm by BaFin. Jefferies GmbH will service EEA institutional clients across Investment Banking, Equities and Fixed Income sectors after Brexit from its office in Frankfurt and branch offices in Amsterdam, Madrid, Milan, Paris and Stockholm. This structure, if needed, might result in a less efficient operating model across Jefferies Group's European legal entities.\nWe may be adversely affected by changes in or the discontinuance of Interbank Offered Rates (\"IBORs\"), in particular, London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\"). Central banks and regulators in a number of major jurisdictions (for example, the U.S., U.K., E.U., Switzerland and Japan) have convened working groups to find, and implement the transition to, suitable replacements for IBORs. The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, has announced that it will not compel panel banks to contribute to LIBOR after 2021 and possibly prior to then. We currently hold IBOR positions with a maturation past 2020. In addition, we rely on vendor applications and data providers that support downstream IBOR data. We are reviewing our positions for a strategic conversion to alternative rates. It is not possible at this time to know what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR and other IBORs, or what the effect will be on the financial markets for financial instruments linked to IBORs. It is possible that pricing volatility, loss of market share in certain products, adverse tax or accounting impacts, increased compliance, legal and operational costs increased capital requirements and business continuity issues will occur.\nA credit rating agency downgrade could significantly impact our businesses. We and Jefferies Group have credit ratings issued by various credit rating agencies. Maintaining our credit ratings is important to our and Jefferies Group's business and financial condition. We advised certain credit rating agencies that we would target specific concentration, leverage and liquidity principles, expressed in the form of certain ratios and percentages. A failure to meet these ratios and percentages could trigger a ratings downgrade. We and Jefferies Group intend to access capital markets and issue debt securities from time to time, and a ratings downgrade may decrease demand for such offered security. A decrease in demand would not only make a successful financing more difficult, but also increase our respective capital costs. Similarly, our and Jefferies Group's access to other forms of credit may be limited and our respective borrowing costs may increase if our or Jefferies Group's credit ratings are downgraded. A downgrade could also negatively impact our and Jefferies Group's outstanding debt prices and our stock price. In addition, in connection with certain over-the-counter derivative contract arrangements and certain other trading arrangements, a ratings downgrade could cause us or Jefferies Group to provide additional collateral to counterparties, exchanges and clearing organizations which would negatively impact our and Jefferies Group's liquidity and financial condition. There can be no assurance that our or Jefferies Group's credit ratings will not be downgraded.\nIn addition, if Berkadia does not maintain specified servicer ratings from the credit rating agencies, customers would have the right to terminate their mortgage servicing agreements. If mortgage servicing agreements were terminated as a result of a servicer ratings downgrade, we could lose a significant portion of the value of our equity investment.\nIncreased competition may adversely affect our revenues and profitability. Many aspects of our business are intensely competitive. We compete directly with a number of bank holding companies and commercial banks, broker-dealers, investment banking firms and other financial institutions. In addition to competition from firms currently in the securities business, there has been increasing competition from others offering financial services, including automated trading and other services based on technological innovations. We believe that the principal factors affecting competition involve market focus, reputation, the abilities of professional personnel, the ability to execute the transaction, relative price of the service and products being offered, bundling\nof products and services and the quality of products and service. Increased competition or an adverse change in our competitive position could lead to a reduction of business and therefore a reduction of revenues and profits.\nThe ability to attract, develop and retain highly skilled and productive employees is critical to the success of our business. Our ability to develop and retain our clients depends on the reputation, judgment, business generation capabilities and skills of our professionals. To compete effectively, we must attract, retain and motivate qualified professionals, including successful financial advisers, investment bankers, trading professionals, portfolio managers and other revenue producing or specialized personnel. Competitive pressures we experience with respect to employees could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nTurnover in the financial services industry is high. The cost of retaining skilled professionals in the financial services industry has escalated considerably. Financial industry employers are increasingly offering guaranteed contracts, upfront payments, and increased compensation. These can be important factors in a current employee's decision to leave us as well as in a prospective employee's decision to join us. As competition for skilled professionals in the industry remains intense, we may have to devote significant resources to attracting and retaining qualified personnel.\nIf we were to lose the services of certain of our professionals, we may not be able to retain valuable relationships and some of our clients could choose to use the services of a competitor instead of our services. If we are unable to retain our professionals or recruit additional professionals, our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected. Further, new business initiatives and efforts to expand existing businesses frequently require that we incur compensation and benefits expense before generating additional revenues.\nMoreover, companies in our industries whose employees accept positions with competitors often claim that those competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices. We may be subject to such claims in the future as we seek to hire qualified personnel who have worked for our competitors. Some of these claims may result in material litigation. We could incur substantial costs in defending against these claims, regardless of their merits. Such claims could also discourage potential employees who work for our competitors from joining us.\nWe could experience significant increases in operating costs and reduced profitability due to competition for skilled management and staff employees in our operating businesses. We compete with many other entities for skilled management and staff employees, including entities that operate in different market sectors than us. Costs to recruit and retain adequate personnel could adversely affect results of operations.\nLegal liability may harm our business. Many aspects of our businesses involve substantial risks of liability, and in the normal course of business, we have been named as a defendant or codefendant in lawsuits involving primarily claims for damages. The risks associated with potential legal liabilities often may be difficult to assess or quantify and their existence and magnitude often remain unknown for substantial periods of time. The expansion of our businesses, including expansions into new products or markets, impose greater risks of liability. In addition, unauthorized or illegal acts of our employees could result in substantial liability. Substantial legal liability could have a material adverse financial effect or cause us significant reputational harm, which in turn could seriously harm our businesses and our prospects. Although our current assessment is that, other than as disclosed in this report, there is no pending litigation that could have a significant adverse impact, if our assessment proves to be in error, then the outcome of litigation could have a significant impact on our financial statements.\nEmployee misconduct, which is difficult to detect and deter, could harm us by impairing our ability to attract and retain clients and subject us to significant legal liability and reputational harm. There is a risk that our employees could engage in misconduct that adversely affects our business. For example, our business often requires that we deal with confidential matters of great significance to our clients. If our employees were to improperly use or disclose confidential information provided by our clients, we could be subject to regulatory sanctions and suffer serious harm to our reputation, financial position, current client relationships and ability to attract future clients. We are also subject to a number of obligations and standards arising from our asset management business and our authority over the assets managed by our asset management business. In addition, our financial advisers may act in a fiduciary capacity, providing financial planning, investment advice, and discretionary asset management. The violation of these obligations and standards by any of our employees would adversely affect our clients and us. It is not always possible to deter associate misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective. If our employees engage in misconduct, our business would be adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to insure certain risks economically. We cannot be certain that we will be able to insure all risks that we desire to insure economically or that all of our insurers or reinsurers will be financially viable if we make a claim. If an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits should occur, or if we are required to pay a deductible for an insured loss, results of operations could be adversely affected.\nA change in tax laws in key jurisdictions could materially increase our tax expense. We are subject to tax in the U.S. and numerous international jurisdictions. Changes to income tax laws and regulations in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate, or in the interpretation of such laws, or in the introduction of new taxes, could significantly increase our effective tax rate and ultimately reduce our cash flow from operating activities and otherwise have an adverse effect on our financial condition.\nIf our tax filing positions were to be challenged by federal, state and local, or foreign tax jurisdictions, we may not be wholly successful in defending our tax filing positions. We record reserves for unrecognized tax benefits based on our assessment of the probability of successfully sustaining tax filing positions. Management exercises significant judgment when assessing the probability of successfully sustaining tax filing positions, and in determining whether a contingent tax liability should be recorded and, if so, estimating the amount. If our tax filing positions are successfully challenged, payments could be required that are in excess of reserved amounts or we may be required to reduce the carrying amount of our net deferred tax asset, either of which result could be significant to our financial condition or results of operations.\nFrom time to time we may invest in securities that are illiquid or subject to restrictions. From time to time we may invest in securities that are subject to restrictions which prohibit us from selling the subject securities for a period of time. Such agreements may limit our ability to generate liquidity quickly through the disposition of the underlying investment while the agreement is effective.\nOur common shares are subject to transfer restrictions. We and some of our subsidiaries have tax attributes, the amount and availability of which are subject to certain qualifications, limitations and uncertainties. In order to reduce the possibility that certain changes in ownership could result in limitations on the use of the tax attributes, our certificate of incorporation contains provisions that generally restrict the ability of a person or entity from acquiring ownership (including through attribution under the tax law) of 5% or more of our common shares and the ability of persons or entities now owning 5% or more of our common shares from acquiring additional common shares. The restriction will remain until the earliest of (a) December 31, 2024, (b) the repeal of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (or any comparable successor provision) and (c) the beginning of a taxable year to which these tax benefits may no longer be carried forward. The restriction may be waived by our Board of Directors on a case by case basis. Shareholders are advised to carefully monitor their ownership of our common shares and consult their own legal advisers and/or us to determine whether their ownership of our common shares approaches the proscribed level.\nOur business is subject to significant credit risk. In the normal course of our businesses, we are involved in the execution, settlement and financing of various customer and principal securities and derivative transactions. These activities are transacted on a cash, margin or delivery-versus-payment basis and are subject to the risk of counterparty or customer nonperformance. Even when transactions are collateralized by the underlying security or other securities, we still face the risks associated with changes in the market value of the collateral through settlement date or during the time when margin is extended and collateral has not been secured or the counterparty defaults before collateral or margin can be adjusted. We may also incur credit risk in its derivative transactions to the extent such transactions result in uncollateralized credit exposure to counterparties.\nWe seek to control the risk associated with these transactions by establishing and monitoring credit limits and by monitoring collateral and transaction levels daily. We may require counterparties to deposit additional collateral or return collateral pledged. In certain circumstances, we may, under industry regulations, purchase the underlying securities in the market and seek reimbursement for any losses from the counterparty. However, there can be no assurances that our risk controls will be successful.\nOur investment in Berkadia may not prove to be successful and may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. As of November 30, 2019, we had an approximately $268.9 million investment in Berkadia. Many factors, most of which are outside of our control, can affect Berkadia's business, including loan losses in excess of reserves, a change in the relationships with U.S. Government-Sponsored Enterprises or federal agencies, a significant loss of customers, and other factors that directly and indirectly effect the results of operations, including the sales and profitability of Berkadia, and consequently may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nIf Berkadia suffered significant losses and was unable to repay its commercial paper borrowings, we would be exposed to loss pursuant to a reimbursement obligation to Berkshire Hathaway. Berkadia obtains funds generated by commercial paper sales of an affiliate of Berkadia. All of the proceeds from the commercial paper sales are used by Berkadia to fund new mortgage loans, servicer advances, investments and other working capital requirements. Repayment of the commercial paper is supported by a $1.5 billion surety policy issued by a Berkshire Hathaway insurance subsidiary and a Berkshire Hathaway corporate guaranty, and we have agreed to reimburse Berkshire Hathaway for one-half of any losses incurred thereunder. If Berkadia suffers significant losses and is unable to repay its commercial paper borrowings, we would suffer losses to the extent of our reimbursement obligation to Berkshire Hathaway. As of November 30, 2019, the aggregate amount of commercial paper outstanding was $1.47 billion.\nOur semi-annual estimates of the fair values of holdings of certain of our merchant banking investments may differ from what can be realized and how these investments are reflected in our financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"). In our January 2020 letter to shareholders and July 2019 earnings release, we have disclosed certain estimated fair values of our merchant banking investments and disclosed our intention to provide semi-annual disclosures relating to the estimated fair value of our holdings of certain merchant banking investments, some of which are consolidated. These semi-annual estimates may differ from how these investments are reflected in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Factors to consider in connection with reviewing these semi-annual estimates of fair value include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nThese estimates are forward-looking statements and should be read in connection with our Cautionary Statement for Forward-Looking Information.\n\u2022\nAlthough we believe these estimates to be fair and reasonable, these semi-annual estimates may differ materially from realized values or future estimates.\n\u2022\nOur semi-annual fair values are, indeed, estimates only and are subject to change.\n\u2022\nWe may determine to change the timing of providing these semi-annual estimates or stop providing such estimates at any time and for any reason.\n\u2022\nManagement does not necessarily use these estimates in making business decisions regarding the operation of our business or any decision relating to these investments.\n\u2022\nThese estimates may constitute non-GAAP financial measures and should be read in connection with disclosures relating to our use of non-GAAP financial measures.\nThe performance of our oil and gas production and development investments, Vitesse Energy Finance and JETX Energy, is impacted by uncertainties specific to the oil and gas industry which we cannot control and may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. As of November 30, 2019, we had an approximately $585.5 million investment in Vitesse Energy Finance and JETX Energy. The oil and gas industry, by its nature, involves a high degree of risk. The value of these investments may be impacted by changes in the prices of oil, gas and natural gas liquids, which are affected by local, regional and global events or conditions that affect supply and demand and which have a history of significant price volatility. These investments are also exposed to changes in regulations affecting the industry, which could increase our cost of compliance, increase taxes or reduce or delay business opportunities. In addition, there are numerous uncertainties inherent in the estimation of future oil and gas production and future income streams associated with production. As a result, actual results could materially differ from those we currently anticipate and our ability to profitably grow these investments could be adversely affected.\nOur investment in real estate may not prove to be successful and may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. As of November 30, 2019, we had an approximately $645.3 million investment in real estate businesses, including HomeFed. Many factors, most of which are outside of our control, can affect HomeFed's business, including the state of the housing market in general and other factors that directly or indirectly effect the results of operations, including the sales and profitability of HomeFed, and consequently may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nOur investment in Linkem may not prove to be successful and may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. As of November 30, 2019, we had an approximately $194.8 million investment in Linkem. Many factors, most of which are outside of our control, can affect Linkem's business, including the state of the Italian economy and capital markets in general, competition in the Italian telecommunications markets and other factors that directly and indirectly effect the results of operations, including the sales and profitability of Linkem, and consequently may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nOur investment in FXCM may not prove to be successful and may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. As of November 30, 2019, we had an approximately $129.3 million investment in FXCM. Many factors, most of which are outside of our control, can affect FXCM's business, including the state of international market and economic conditions which impact trading volume and currency volatility, changes in regulatory requirements and other factors that directly or indirectly effect the results of operations, including the sales and profitability of FXCM, and consequently may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nOur investment in Idaho Timber may not prove to be successful and may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. As of November 30, 2019, we had an approximately $77.9 million investment in Idaho Timber. Many factors, most of which are outside of our control, can affect Idaho Timber's business, including demand for its products, prices and availability of raw materials and other factors that directly and indirectly effect the results operations, including the sales and profitability of Idaho Timber, and consequently may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nOur investment in The We Company may not prove to be successful and may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. As of November 30, 2019, we had an approximately $53.8 million investment in The We Company. During 2019, we incurred a mark down of approximately $182.3 million relating to this investment due to a decrease in The We Company's valuation. Many factors, most of which are outside of our control, can affect The We Company's business, including the expansion of its business, number of customers and other factors that directly and indirectly effect the results of operations, including the sales and profitability of The We Company, and consequently may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.", "PERMNO": 20415, "SIC": 6211, "TIC": "JEF"}
