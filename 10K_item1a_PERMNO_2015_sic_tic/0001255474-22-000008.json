Risk Factors\nEach of the risks described below should be carefully considered, together with all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before making an investment decision with respect to our securities. In the event of the occurrence, reoccurrence, continuation or increased severity of any of the risks described below, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nSummary Risk Factors\nThe following is a summary of the material risks and uncertainties we have identified, which should be read in conjunction with the more detailed description of each risk factor contained below.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Operations\n\u25cf Declines in, or extended periods of low oil, NGL or natural gas prices and/or widened differentials;\n\u25cf The occurrence of epidemic or pandemic diseases, including the coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) pandemic;\n\u25cf Actions of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (\u201cOPEC\u201d) and other oil exporting nations to set and maintain production levels;\n\u25cf The potential shutdown of the Dakota Access Pipeline (\u201cDAPL\u201d);\n\u25cf The geographic concentration of our operations;\n\u25cf Our potential inability to access oil and gas markets due to market conditions or operational impediments;\n\u25cf Market availability of, and risks associated with, transport of oil and natural gas, which may subject us to substantial liability claims;\n\u25cf Shortages of or delays in obtaining qualified personnel or equipment, including drilling rigs and completion services;\n\u25cf Adverse weather conditions that may negatively impact development or production activities;\n\u25cf Lack of control over non-operated properties;\n\u25cf Cybersecurity attacks or failures of our telecommunication and other information technology infrastructure;\n\u25cf Our level of success in development and production activities;\n\u25cf Our ability to replace our oil and natural gas reserves;\n\u25cf Impacts resulting from the allocation of resources among our strategic opportunities;\n\u25cf Our ability to successfully complete asset acquisitions and dispositions and the risks related thereto;\n\u25cf The timing of our development expenditures;\n\u25cf Unforeseen underperformance of or liabilities associated with acquired properties or other strategic partnerships or investments; and\n\u25cf Competition in the oil and gas industry.\nRisks Related to Our Capital Structure and Financial Results\n\u25cf The impacts of hedging on our results of operations and cash flows;\n\u25cf Revisions to reserve estimates as a result of changes in commodity prices, regulation and other factors;\n\u25cf Inaccuracies of our reserve estimates or our assumptions underlying them;\n\u25cf Our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards (\u201cNOLs\u201d) in future periods;\n\u25cf Our ability to comply with debt covenants, periodic redeterminations of the borrowing base under Whiting Oil and Gas Corporation\u2019s (\u201cWhiting Oil and Gas\u201d) Credit Agreement and our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to service any indebtedness we incur;\n\u25cf Our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet the internally funded portion of our capital expenditures budget; and\n\u25cf Impacts to financial statements as a result of impairment write-downs and other cash and noncash charges.\nRisks Related to Government Regulations, Investor Sentiment, Corporate Governance and Legal Proceedings\n\u25cf The impact and costs of compliance with laws and regulations governing our oil and gas operations;\n\u25cf Impacts of local regulations, climate change issues, negative perception of our industry and corporate governance standards;\n\u25cf The potential impact of changes in laws that could have a negative effect on the oil and gas industry;\n\u25cf The impact of negative shifts in investor sentiment towards the oil and gas industry; and\n\u25cf Negative impacts from litigation and legal proceedings.\nRisks Related to Our Chapter 11 Bankruptcy\n\u25cf The effect of our emergence from bankruptcy on our business and relationships;\n\u25cf The fact that our historical financial results may not be comparable to our actual financial results after emergence from bankruptcy and may not be indicative of future financial performance; and\n\u25cf The new securities we issued upon emergence may result in potential future dilution.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Operations\nOil and natural gas prices and differentials are very volatile. An extended period of low oil and natural gas prices and/or widened differentials may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe oil and natural gas markets are very volatile, and we cannot predict future oil and natural gas prices. The price we receive for our oil, NGL and natural gas production heavily influences our revenue, profitability, access to capital and future rate of growth. The prices we receive for our production depend on numerous factors beyond our control, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u25cf changes in regional, domestic and global supply and demand for oil and natural gas;\n\u25cf the level of global oil and natural gas inventories and storage capacity;\n\u25cf the occurrence or threat of epidemic or pandemic diseases, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, or any government response to such occurrence or threat;\n\u25cf the actions or inactions of OPEC;\n\u25cf proximity, capacity and availability of oil and natural gas pipelines and other transportation facilities, including any court rulings which may result in the inability to transport oil on the DAPL;\n\u25cf the price and quantity of imports of oil and natural gas;\n\u25cf market demand and capacity limitations on exports of oil and natural gas;\n\u25cf political and economic conditions, including embargoes and sanctions, in oil-producing countries or affecting other oil-producing activity, such as the U.S. imposed sanctions on Venezuela and Iran and conflicts in the Middle East;\n\u25cf developments relating to North American energy infrastructure, including legislative, regulatory and court actions that may impact such infrastructure and other developments that may cause short- or long-term capacity constraints;\n\u25cf the level of global oil and natural gas exploration and production activity;\n\u25cf the effects of global conservation and sustainability measures;\n\u25cf the effects of the global and domestic economies, including the impact of expected growth, access to credit and financial markets, the relative strength of the United States dollar compared to foreign currencies and other economic conditions;\n\u25cf weather conditions and natural disasters;\n\u25cf technological advances affecting energy consumption;\n\u25cf current and anticipated changes to domestic and foreign governmental regulations, such as regulation of oil and natural gas gathering and transportation;\n\u25cf the price and availability of competitors\u2019 supplies of oil and natural gas;\n\u25cf basis differentials associated with market conditions, the quality and location of production and other factors;\n\u25cf acts of terrorism;\n\u25cf the price and availability of alternative fuels and energy sources; and\n\u25cf force majeure events.\nThese factors and the volatility of the energy markets generally make it extremely difficult to predict future oil and natural gas price movements. Also, prices for crude oil, NGLs and natural gas do not necessarily move in tandem. Declines in oil, NGL or natural gas prices would not only reduce revenue, but could also reduce the amount of economically viable production and therefore potentially lower our reserve quantities. If the oil and natural gas industry experiences extended periods of low prices, we may, among other things, be unable to meet all of our financial obligations or make planned expenditures.\nSubstantial and extended declines in oil, NGL and natural gas prices have resulted and may continue to result in impairments of our proved oil and gas properties or undeveloped acreage and may materially and adversely affect our future business, financial condition, cash flows, results of operations, liquidity or ability to finance planned capital expenditures. To the extent commodity prices received from production are insufficient to fund planned capital expenditures, we will be required to reduce spending, borrow under the Credit Agreement or sell assets. Lower commodity prices may reduce the amount of our borrowing base under the Credit Agreement, which is determined at the discretion of our lenders based on the collateral value of our proved reserves that have been mortgaged to the lenders, and is subject to regular redeterminations on April 1 and October 1 of each year, as well as special redeterminations described in the Credit Agreement. Upon a redetermination, if total outstanding credit exposure exceeds the redetermined borrowing base, we could be forced to repay borrowings under the Credit Agreement.\nLower commodity prices may also reduce the proceeds we receive from the sale of assets or make it more difficult for us to comply with the covenants and other restrictions in the agreements governing our debt as described under the Risk Factor entitled \u201cThe Credit Agreement contains various covenants limiting the discretion of our management in operating our business.\u201d\nAlternatively, higher oil, NGL and natural gas prices may result in significant mark-to-market losses being incurred on our commodity-based derivatives.\nAdditionally, the prices that we receive for our oil and natural gas production generally reflect a discount, but sometimes a premium, to relevant benchmark prices such as NYMEX. A negative or positive difference between the benchmark price and the price received is called a differential. The differential may vary significantly due to market conditions, the quality and location of production and other risk factors, as demonstrated in the fourth quarter of 2018 when our oil differentials weakened substantially. We cannot accurately predict oil and natural gas differentials. Changes in the differential and decreases in the benchmark price for oil and natural gas could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe occurrence of epidemic or pandemic diseases, including the COVID-19 pandemic, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nGlobal or national health concerns, including the outbreak of pandemic or contagious disease or its related variants, can negatively impact the global economy and, therefore, demand and pricing for oil and natural gas products. For example, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic in March 2020, and the continued duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and its ongoing impact on our business cannot be predicted. The outbreak of communicable diseases, or the perception that such an outbreak could occur, could result in a widespread public health crisis that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries, resulting in an economic downturn that would negatively impact the demand for oil and natural gas products. Furthermore, uncertainty regarding the impact and length of any outbreak of pandemic or contagious disease, including COVID-19, can and has led to increased volatility in oil and natural gas prices. Finally, in the event that there is an outbreak of COVID-19 at any of our operating locations, we could be forced to cease operations at such locations for a period of time. The occurrence or continuation of any of these events could lead to decreased revenues and limit our ability to execute our business plan, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe ability or willingness of OPEC and other oil exporting nations to set and maintain production levels has a significant impact on oil prices.\nOPEC is an intergovernmental organization that seeks to manage the price and supply of oil on the global energy market. Actions or inaction of OPEC members, including those taken alongside other oil exporting nations, have a significant impact on global oil supply and pricing. For example, OPEC and certain other oil exporting nations have previously agreed to take measures, including production cuts and increases, in an effort to achieve certain global supply or demand targets or to achieve certain crude oil price outcomes. There can be no assurance that OPEC members and other oil exporting nations will continue to agree to future production cuts, moderating future production or other actions to support and stabilize oil prices, and they may take actions that have the effect of reducing oil prices. Uncertainty regarding future actions to be taken by OPEC members or other oil exporting countries could lead to increased volatility in the price of oil, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe transport a portion of our crude oil through the DAPL, which is subject to ongoing litigation that may result in a shutdown of the DAPL, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOn March 25, 2020, the U.S. District Court for D.C. (\u201cD.C. District Court\u201d) found that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (\u201cArmy Corps\u201d) had violated the National Environmental Policy Act when it granted an easement relating to a portion of the Dakota Access Pipeline (\u201cDAPL\u201d) because it had failed to prepare an environmental impact statement (\u201cEIS\u201d). As a result, in an order issued July 6, 2020, the D.C. District Court vacated the easement and directed that the DAPL be shut down and emptied of oil by August 5, 2020. After issuing a stay of the order to shut down the pipeline on August 5, 2020, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit (\u201cD.C. Appellate Court\u201d), on January 26, 2021, affirmed the D.C. District Court\u2019s decision to vacate the easement and concluded that the D.C. District Court must further consider whether shut down of the DAPL is an appropriate remedy while the Army Corps develops an EIS. On May 21, 2021, the D.C. District Court ruled that it would not issue an injunction requiring a shutdown of the DAPL and that the DAPL could continue to operate while the Army Corps prepares an EIS. The D.C. District Court further ruled on June 22, 2021 that the litigation be dismissed and that the plaintiffs could renew their challenge to DAPL upon the Army Corps\u2019 issuance of an EIS. Barring different discretionary action by the Army Corps, these rulings allow the DAPL\u2019s continued operation unless and until new challenges are made and succeed following issuance of the EIS, which the Army Corps anticipates issuing in the fall of 2022. On September 20, 2021, the DAPL\u2019s owner filed a petition with the U.S. Supreme Court seeking review of the lower courts\u2019 decisions requiring a new EIS and permit, and the plaintiff tribes and Army Corps filed briefs opposing such review. However, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to accept the case for review. The potential disruption of transportation as a result of the DAPL being shut down or the anticipation of the DAPL being shut down could negatively impact our ability to achieve the most favorable prices for our crude oil production, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. While we are coordinating with our midstream partners and downstream markets to source transportation alternatives in order to mitigate the impact of a DAPL shutdown, we cannot provide any assurance that our efforts to do so will be successful.\nSubstantially all of our producing properties are concentrated in the Williston Basin of North Dakota and Montana, making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in one major geographic area.\nSubstantially all of our producing properties are geographically concentrated in the Williston Basin of North Dakota and Montana. At December 31, 2021, approximately 98% of our total estimated proved reserves were attributable to properties located in this area. Because of this concentration in a limited geographic area, the success and profitability of our operations may be disproportionately exposed to regional factors compared to competitors having more geographically dispersed operations. These factors include, among others: (i) the prices of crude oil and natural gas produced from wells in the region and other regional supply and demand factors, including gathering, pipeline and rail transportation capacity constraints, (ii) the availability of rigs, equipment, oilfield services, supplies and labor, (iii) the availability of processing and refining facilities and (iv) infrastructure capacity. In addition, our operations in the Williston Basin may be adversely affected by severe weather events such as floods, blizzards, ice storms, tornadoes and freezing temperatures which can intensify competition for the items and services described above and may result in periodic shortages. The concentration of our operations in a limited geographic area also increases our exposure to changes in local laws and regulations, certain lease stipulations designed to protect wildlife and unexpected events that may occur in the regions such as natural disasters, seismic events (which may result in third-party lawsuits), industrial accidents, labor difficulties, civil disturbances, public protests or terrorist attacks. Any one of these events has the potential to cause producing wells to be shut-in, delay operations, decrease cash flows, increase operating and capital costs and prevent development of lease inventory before expiration. Any of the risks described above could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nMarket conditions or operational impediments may hinder our access to oil and gas markets or delay our production.\nIn connection with our continued development of oil and gas properties, we are exposed to the risk of delays or interruptions of production from wells on these properties caused by transportation capacity constraints, curtailment of production or the unavailability of transportation infrastructure for the oil and gas volumes produced. In addition, market conditions or a lack of satisfactory oil and gas transportation arrangements may hinder our access to oil and gas markets or delay our production. The availability of a ready market for our oil, NGL and natural gas production depends on a number of factors, including the demand for and supply of oil, NGLs and natural gas, downstream market conditions and competing supply alternatives. Our ability to market our production also depends substantially on the availability and capacity of gathering systems, pipelines and processing facilities owned and operated by third parties and the ability to obtain such services on acceptable terms. We may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of delays or interruptions of production caused by market constraints or interruptions in transportation of our production. This could lead to production curtailments or shut-ins and reduced revenue which could materially harm our business. We may enter into arrangements for transportation services and sales to reduce curtailment risks. However, these services expose us to the risk that third parties will default on their obligations under such arrangements.\nRisks associated with the production, gathering, transportation and sale of oil, NGLs and natural gas could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows and may subject us to substantial liability claims.\nOur financial condition, net income and cash flows will depend upon, among other things, oil, NGL and natural gas production and the prices received and costs incurred to develop and produce oil and natural gas reserves. Drilling, production or transportation accidents that temporarily or permanently halt the production and sale of oil, NGLs and natural gas will decrease revenues and increase expenditures and may subject us to liability. For example, accidents may occur that result in personal injuries, property damage, damage to productive formations or equipment and environmental damages. Any costs incurred in connection with any such accidents that are not insured against will have the effect of reducing net income. We do not have insurance policies in effect that are intended to provide coverage for losses solely related to hydraulic fracturing operations. Also, our oil, NGL and natural gas production depends in large part on the proximity and capacity of pipeline systems and transportation facilities which are mostly owned by third parties. The lack of availability or the lack of capacity on these systems and facilities could result in the curtailment of production or the delay or discontinuance of drilling plans. Similarly, curtailments or damage to pipelines and other transportation facilities used to transport oil, NGL and natural gas production to markets for sale could decrease revenues or increase transportation expenses. Any such curtailments or damage to the gathering systems could also require us to find alternative means to transport oil, NGL and natural gas production. Such alternative means may not be available or could result in additional costs that will have the effect of increasing transportation expenses or differentials. Adverse changes in the terms and conditions of natural gas pipeline tariffs could result in increased costs or competitive disadvantages.\nIn addition, drilling, production and transportation of hydrocarbons bear the inherent risk of loss of containment. Potential consequences include, but are not limited to, loss of reserves, loss of production, loss of economic value associated with the affected wellbore, personal injuries and death, contamination of air, soil, ground water and surface water. We could be subject to fines, penalties or other damages associated with any event of this nature.\nWe are not insured against all risks. Losses and liabilities arising from uninsured and underinsured events could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Our oil and natural gas exploration and production activities\nare subject to all of the operating risks associated with drilling for and producing oil and natural gas, including, but not limited to, the possibility of:\n\u25cf environmental hazards, such as uncontrollable flows of oil, gas, brine, well fluids, toxic gas or other pollution into the environment, including groundwater and shoreline contamination;\n\u25cf abnormally pressured formations;\n\u25cf mechanical difficulties, such as stuck oil field drilling and service tools and casing collapse;\n\u25cf the loss of well control;\n\u25cf fires and explosions;\n\u25cf personal injuries and death;\n\u25cf terrorist attacks; and\n\u25cf natural disasters.\nAny of these risks could adversely affect our ability to conduct operations or result in substantial losses to our company. We may elect not to obtain insurance if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. If a significant accident or other event occurs and is not fully covered by insurance, then it could adversely affect us.\nThe unavailability or cost of additional drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, personnel and oil field services could adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans on a timely basis or within our budget.\nThe demand for qualified and experienced field personnel to conduct field operations, geologists, geophysicists, engineers and other professionals in the oil and natural gas industry can fluctuate significantly, often in correlation with oil and natural gas prices or economic trends in the broader economy, causing periodic shortages. Historically, there have been shortages of drilling rigs, completion crews and other oilfield equipment as demand for these items has increased along with the number of wells being drilled and completed. These factors also cause significant increases in costs for equipment, services and personnel. Higher oil and natural gas prices generally stimulate demand and result in increased prices for drilling rigs and other oilfield goods and services. Shortages of field personnel and other professionals, drilling rigs, completion crews, equipment or supplies, and any resulting price increases, could delay or adversely affect our exploration and development operations, which could restrict such operations or have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nAdverse weather conditions and lease stipulations adversely affect our ability to conduct drilling activities in some of the areas where we operate.\nOil and gas operations in the Rocky Mountains are adversely affected by weather conditions and lease stipulations designed to protect various wildlife. In certain areas, drilling and other oil and gas activities can only be conducted during certain months due to severe weather. This limits our ability to operate in those areas and can intensify competition during those months for drilling rigs, oil field equipment, services, supplies and qualified personnel, which may lead to periodic shortages. Resulting shortages or high costs could delay our operations, cause temporary declines in our oil and gas production and materially increase our operating and capital costs and reduce our cash flows. Severe weather events may increase in duration and intensity as a result of climate change, in which case these risks will be greater in the future.\nWe have limited control over activities on properties we do not operate, which could increase capital expenditures.\nWe operate 88% of our net productive oil and natural gas wells, which represents 92% of our proved developed producing reserves as of December 31, 2021. If we do not operate the properties in which we own an interest, we do not have control over normal capital expenditures or future development of those properties. The success and timing of our drilling and development activities on properties operated by others therefore depends upon a number of factors outside of our control, including the operator\u2019s decisions with respect to the timing and amount of capital expenditures, the period of time over which the operator seeks to generate a return on capital expenditures, inclusion of other participants in drilling wells, the use of technology, as well as the operator\u2019s expertise and financial resources and the operator\u2019s relative interest in the field. Accordingly, while we use reasonable efforts to cause the operator to act in a prudent manner, we are limited in our ability to do so.\nWe depend on computer and telecommunications systems, and failures in our systems or cybersecurity attacks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur business has become increasingly dependent upon digital technologies to conduct day-to-day operations, including information systems, infrastructure and cloud applications. We have entered into agreements with third parties for hardware, software, telecommunications and other information technology services in connection with our business. In addition, we have developed proprietary software systems, management techniques and other information technologies incorporating software licensed from third parties. We rely on such systems to process, transmit and securely store electronic information, including financial records, banking information and personally identifiable information such as contractor, investor and payroll data, and to manage or support a variety of business processes, including our supply chain, pipeline operations, gathering and processing operations, financial transactions, banking and numerous other processes and transactions.\nAs dependence on digital technologies has increased, cyber incidents, including deliberate attacks and unintentional events, also have increased in frequency. A cyber-attack could include unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption, or result in denial-of-service on websites. It is possible that we could incur interruptions or loss of data from cybersecurity attacks, computer viruses or malware, or that third-party service providers could cause a breach of our data. Any interruptions to our arrangements with third parties for our computing and communications infrastructure or any other interruptions to, or breaches of, our information systems could lead to data corruption, communication interruption, loss of sensitive or confidential information or otherwise significantly disrupt our business operations.\nStrategic targets, such as energy-related assets and transportation assets, may be at greater risk of future cyber-attacks than other targets. The various procedures, facilities, infrastructure and controls we utilize to monitor these threats and mitigate our exposure to such threats are costly and labor intensive. Moreover, there can be no assurance that such measures will be sufficient to prevent security breaches from occurring. We do not expect to obtain or maintain specialized insurance for possible liability or loss resulting from a cyber-attack on our assets that may shut down all or part of our business. However, as cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. State and federal cybersecurity legislation could also impose new requirements, which could increase our cost of doing business.\nTo our knowledge we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber-attacks; however, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer material losses in the future either as a result of an interruption to or a breach of our systems or those of our third-party vendors and service providers. A cyber incident involving our information systems and related infrastructure, or that of third parties, could disrupt our business plans and negatively impact our operations in the following ways, among others, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows:\n\u25cf unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or personally identifiable information, including by cyber-attacks or other security breaches, could cause loss of data, give rise to remediation or other expenses, expose us to liability under federal and state laws, reduce our customers\u2019 willingness to do business with us, disrupt the services we provide to customers and property owners and subject us to litigation and investigations;\n\u25cf a cyber-attack on a third party could result in supply chain disruptions which could delay or halt development of additional infrastructure, effectively delaying the start of cash flow from the project;\n\u25cf a cyber-attack on downstream or midstream pipelines could prevent us from delivering product, resulting in a loss of revenues;\n\u25cf a cyber-attack on a communications network or power grid could cause operational disruption resulting in a loss of revenues;\n\u25cf a deliberate corruption of our financial or operational data could result in events of non-compliance which could lead to regulatory fines or penalties; and\n\u25cf business interruptions could result in expensive remediation efforts, distraction of management, damage to our reputation, or a negative impact on the price of our common shares.\nDrilling for and producing oil and natural gas are high-risk activities with many uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur future success will depend on the success of our development and production activities. Our oil and natural gas development activities are subject to numerous risks beyond our control, including the risk that drilling will not result in commercially viable oil or natural gas production or that production will fall short of our estimates. Our decisions to purchase, explore, develop or otherwise exploit prospects or properties will depend in part on the evaluation of data obtained through geophysical and geological analyses, production data and engineering studies, the results of which are often inconclusive or subject to varying interpretations. Refer to the Risk Factor entitled \u201cReserve estimates depend on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate...\u201d for a discussion of the uncertainty involved in these processes. Our cost of drilling, completing and operating wells is often uncertain before drilling commences. Overruns in budgeted expenditures are common risks that can make a particular project uneconomical or, even if economical, less successful than we projected. Further, many factors may curtail, delay or cancel drilling, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u25cf substantial or extended declines in oil, NGL and natural gas prices;\n\u25cf delays imposed by or resulting from compliance with regulatory requirements;\n\u25cf delays in or limits on the issuance of drilling permits by state agencies or on our federal leases, including as a result of government shutdowns;\n\u25cf pressure or irregularities in geological formations;\n\u25cf limitations in infrastructure, including pipeline takeaway and refining and processing capacity;\n\u25cf shortages of or delays in obtaining qualified personnel or equipment, including drilling rigs and completion services;\n\u25cf equipment failures, accidents, fires and explosions, including ruptures of pipelines or storage facilities or train derailments;\n\u25cf adverse weather events, such as floods, blizzards, ice storms, tornadoes and freezing temperatures; and\n\u25cf title defects.\nUnless we replace our oil and natural gas reserves, our reserves and production will decline and we may not be able to sustain production.\nUnless we conduct successful development and production activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves, our proved reserves will decline over time. Producing oil and natural gas reservoirs are generally characterized by declining production rates that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors. Our future oil and natural gas reserves and production, and therefore our cash flow and income, are highly dependent on our success in efficiently developing and producing our current reserves and finding economically recoverable or acquiring additional economically recoverable reserves. In pursuing acquisitions, we compete with other companies, many of which have greater financial and other resources to acquire attractive companies or properties. Therefore, we may not be able to develop, find or acquire additional reserves to sustain or replace our current and future production, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nStrategic determinations, including the allocation of capital and other resources to strategic opportunities, are challenging, and a failure to appropriately allocate capital and resources among our strategic opportunities may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur future growth prospects are dependent upon our ability to identify optimal strategies for investing our capital resources to produce favorable rates of return. In developing our business plan, we consider allocating capital and other resources to various aspects of our business including well development (primarily drilling), reserve acquisitions, corporate items and other alternatives. We also consider our likely sources of capital, including cash generated from operations and borrowings under the Credit Agreement. Notwithstanding the determinations made in the development of our business plan, business opportunities not previously identified periodically come to our attention, including possible acquisitions and dispositions. If we fail to identify optimal business strategies or fail to optimize our capital investment and capital raising opportunities and the use of our other resources in furtherance of our business strategies, our financial condition and future growth may be adversely affected. Moreover, economic or other circumstances may change from those contemplated by our business plan and our failure to recognize or respond to those changes may limit our ability to achieve our objectives.\nPart of our business strategy includes selling properties and this subjects us to various risks.\nPart of our business strategy includes selling properties when we believe that the sales price realized will provide an above average rate of return for the property or when the property no longer matches the profile of properties we desire to own. However, there is no assurance that such sales will occur in the time frames or with the economic terms we expect. Unless we conduct successful exploration, development and production activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves, divestitures of our properties will reduce our proved reserves and potentially our production. We may not be able to develop, find or acquire additional reserves sufficient to replace such reserves and production from any of the properties we sell. Additionally, agreements pursuant to which we sell properties may include terms that survive closing of the sale, including but not limited to indemnification provisions, which could result in us retaining substantial liabilities.\nOur identified drilling locations are scheduled out over several years, making them susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling.\nWe have specifically identified and scheduled drilling locations as an estimation of our future multi-year drilling activities on our existing acreage. These scheduled drilling locations represent a significant part of our business strategy. Our ability to drill and develop these locations depends on a number of uncertainties, including oil and natural gas prices, the availability of capital, costs of oil field goods and services, drilling results, our ability to extend drilling acreage leases beyond expiration, regulatory approvals and other factors. Because of these uncertainties, we do not know if the numerous potential drilling locations we have identified will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce oil or gas from these or any other potential drilling locations. As such, our actual drilling activities may materially differ from our current plan, and this could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows or require us to remove certain proved undeveloped reserves from our proved reserve base if we are unable to drill PUD locations within the SEC\u2019s prescribed 5-year window.\nProperties that we acquire may not produce as projected, and we may be unable to identify liabilities associated with the properties or obtain indemnities from sellers for liabilities they may have created.\nOur business strategy includes a continuing acquisition program. The successful acquisition of producing properties requires assessment of many factors, which are inherently inexact and may be inaccurate, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u25cf the anticipated levels of recoverable reserves, earnings or cash flow;\n\u25cf future oil and natural gas prices;\n\u25cf estimates of operating costs;\n\u25cf estimates of future development costs;\n\u25cf timing of future development costs;\n\u25cf estimates of the costs and timing of plugging and abandonment; and\n\u25cf the assumption of unknown potential environmental and other liabilities, losses or costs, including but not limited to title defects, historical spills or releases for which we are not indemnified or for which our indemnity is inadequate.\nFurthermore, acquisitions pose substantial risks to our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The risks associated with acquisitions, either completed or future acquisitions, include, but are not limited to:\n\u25cf we may be unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully and to realize anticipated economic, operational and other benefits in a timely manner, which could result in substantial costs and delays or other operational, technical or financial problems;\n\u25cf acquisitions could disrupt our ongoing business, distract management, divert resources and make it difficult to maintain our current business standards, controls and procedures; and\n\u25cf we may issue additional equity or debt securities in order to fund future acquisitions.\nOur assessment of a potential acquisition will not reveal all existing or potential problems, nor will it permit us to become familiar enough with the properties to assess fully their capabilities and deficiencies. In the course of our due diligence, we may not inspect every well, platform, facility or pipeline. Inspections may not reveal structural and environmental problems, such as pipeline corrosion or groundwater contamination, when they are made. We may not be able to obtain contractual indemnities from the seller for liabilities that it created. We may be required to assume the risk of the physical condition of the properties in addition to the risk that the properties may not perform in accordance with our expectations.\nWe expect to consider from time to time further strategic opportunities that may involve acquisitions, dispositions, investments in joint ventures, partnerships, and other strategic alternatives that may enhance shareholder value, any of which may result in the use of a significant amount of our management resources or significant costs, and we may not be able to fully realize the potential benefit of such transactions.\nWe expect to continue to consider acquisitions, dispositions, investments in joint ventures, partnerships, and other strategic alternatives with the objective of maximizing shareholder value. Our Board and our management may from time to time be engaged in evaluating potential transactions and other strategic alternatives. In addition, from time to time, we may engage financial advisors, enter into non-disclosure agreements, conduct discussions, and undertake other actions that may result in one or more transactions. Although there would be uncertainty that any of these activities or discussions would result in definitive agreements or the completion of any transaction, we may devote a significant amount of our management resources to analyzing and pursuing such a transaction, which could negatively impact our operations, and may impair our ability to retain and motivate key personnel. In addition, we may incur significant costs in connection with seeking such transactions or other strategic alternatives regardless of whether the transaction is completed. In the event that we consummate an acquisition, disposition, partnership or other strategic transaction in the future, we cannot be certain that we would fully realize the potential benefit of such a transaction and cannot predict the impact that such strategic transaction might have on our operations or stock price. Any potential transaction would be dependent upon a number of factors that may be beyond our control, including, among other factors, market conditions, industry trends, regulatory limitations and the interest of third parties in us and our assets. There can be no assurance that the exploration of strategic alternatives will result in any specific action or transaction. Further, any such strategic alternative may not ultimately lead to increased shareholder value. We do not undertake to provide updates or make further comments regarding the evaluation of strategic alternatives, unless otherwise required by law.\nCompetition in the oil and gas industry and from alternative energy sources is intense, which may adversely affect our ability to achieve our strategic goals.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment for acquiring properties, obtaining investment capital, securing oilfield goods and services, marketing oil and natural gas products and attracting and retaining qualified personnel. Many of our competitors possess and employ financial, technical and personnel resources substantially greater than ours, which can be particularly important in the areas in which we operate. Those companies may be able to pay more for productive oil and gas properties and exploratory prospects and to evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our resources allow. Furthermore, competitive conditions may be substantially affected by various forms of energy legislation or regulation enacted by state, local and U.S. government bodies and their associated agencies, especially with regards to environmental protection and climate-related policies. Such laws and regulations may substantially increase the costs of exploring for or developing or producing oil and natural gas and our larger competitors may be able to better absorb the burden of such legislation and regulation, which would also adversely affect our competitive position. Our ability to acquire additional prospects and to find and develop reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. We may not be able to compete successfully in the future in acquiring prospective reserves, developing reserves, marketing hydrocarbons, attracting and retaining quality personnel and raising additional capital.\nWe also face indirect competition from alternative energy sources, such as wind, solar, nuclear, hydrogen and electric power. The proliferation of alternative energy sources and businesses that provide such alternative energy sources may decrease the demand for oil and natural gas products. These alternative energy sources may increase in the future in response to concerns about climate change or the enactment of climate-related policies. Decreased demand for our products could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nRisks Related to Our Capital Structure and Financial Results\nOur use of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids price hedging contracts involves only a portion of our anticipated production, may limit higher cash flows in the future in connection with commodity price increases and may result in significant fluctuations in our net income.\nWe enter into hedging transactions relating to our oil, natural gas and NGL production to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the price of oil, natural gas and NGLs. Our hedging transactions to date have consisted of financially settled crude oil, natural gas and NGL options contracts, primarily two-way collars and swaps, placed with major financial institutions. As of February 17, 2022, we had crude oil derivative contracts (consisting of collars and swaps) covering the sale of 39,000 Bbl and 16,000 Bbl of oil per day for the remainder of 2022 and the first three quarters of 2023, respectively. Additionally, we had natural gas derivative contracts (consisting of collars, swaps and basis swaps) covering the sale of 95,000 MMBtu and 61,000 MMBtu of natural gas per day through the remainder of 2022 and first three quarters of 2023, respectively. Finally, we had NGL derivative contracts (consisting of swaps) covering the sale of 223,000 gallons of NGLs per day for the remainder of 2022. Refer to \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\u201d in Item 7A and the \u201cDerivative Financial Instruments\u201d footnote of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for pricing information and a more detailed discussion of our hedging transactions.\nWe may in the future enter into these and other types of hedging arrangements to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the market prices of oil, natural gas and NGLs, or alternatively, we may decide to unwind or restructure the hedging arrangements we previously entered into. Hedging transactions expose us to risk of financial loss in some circumstances, including if production is less than expected, the other party to the contract defaults on its obligations or there is a change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the hedging agreement and actual prices received. Hedging transactions may limit the benefit we may otherwise receive from increases in the price for oil, natural gas and NGLs. Furthermore, if we are party to hedging transactions that cover a smaller percentage of our production than our competitors, we may be more adversely affected by declines in oil and natural gas prices than those competitors. Additionally, hedging transactions may expose us to cash margin requirements.\nWe recognize all gains and losses from changes in commodity derivative fair values immediately in earnings rather than deferring any such amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Consequently, we may experience significant net losses, on a non-cash basis, due to changes in the value of our hedges as a result of commodity price volatility. Additionally, settlements paid on hedging arrangements may significantly decrease our cash flow from operating activities in periods where current commodity prices are higher than the ceilings or swap price of certain hedging arrangements.\nAlso, in 2010, the U.S. Congress adopted the Dodd-Frank Act, which, among other provisions, established federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market. The regulations could increase the cost of derivative contracts, reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we encounter, reduce our ability to monetize or restructure existing derivative contracts, lead to fewer potential counterparties, and increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties, any of which could limit our desire and ability to implement commodity price risk management strategies. If our use of derivatives becomes limited as a result of the regulations, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable. Certain aspects of the Dodd-Frank rulemaking have been repealed or have not been finalized and the ultimate effect of the regulations on our business remains uncertain.\nReserve estimates depend on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves.\nThe process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex. It requires interpretations of available technical data and many assumptions, including assumptions relating to economic factors. Any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves referred to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn order to prepare our estimates, we must project production rates and timing of development expenditures. We must also analyze available geological, geophysical, production and engineering data. The extent, quality and reliability of this data can vary. The process also requires economic assumptions about matters such as the following, among others:\n\u25cf historical production from the area compared with production rates from other producing areas;\n\u25cf the assumed effect of governmental regulation; and\n\u25cf assumptions about future prices of oil, NGLs and natural gas including differentials, production and development costs, gathering and transportation costs, severance and excise taxes, capital expenditures and availability of funds.\nTherefore, estimates of oil and natural gas reserves are inherently imprecise. Actual future production, oil, NGL and natural gas prices, revenues, taxes, exploration and development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves will most likely vary from our estimates. Any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves referred to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history, results of exploration and development, prevailing oil and natural gas prices and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nYou should not assume that the present value of future net revenues from our proved reserves, as referred to in this report, is the current market value of our estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements, we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on 12-month average prices and current costs as of the date of the estimate. The 12-month average prices used for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $66.56 per Bbl of oil and $3.60 per MMBtu of natural gas. Actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the estimate. If the 12-month average oil prices used to calculate our oil reserves were $1.00 per Bbl lower, then the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows of our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2021 would have decreased by $71 million. If the 12-month average natural gas prices used to calculate our natural gas reserves were $0.10 per MMBtu lower, then the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows of our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2021 would have decreased by $17 million.\nOur ability to use our NOLs in future periods may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had U.S. federal NOLs of $3.3 billion, the majority of which will expire between 2022 and 2037, if not limited by triggering events prior to such time. Under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (\u201cIRC\u201d), changes in our ownership, in certain circumstances, will limit the amount of U.S. federal NOLs that can be utilized annually in the future to offset taxable income. In particular, Section 382 of the IRC imposes limitations on a company\u2019s ability to use NOLs upon certain changes in such ownership. As a result of the chapter 11 reorganization and related transactions, we experienced an ownership change within the meaning of IRC Section 382 that subjected certain of our tax attributes, including NOLs, to an IRC Section 382 limitation. Calculations pursuant to Section 382 of the IRC can be very complicated and no assurance can be given that upon further analysis, our ability to take advantage of our NOLs may be limited to a greater extent than we currently anticipate. If we are limited in our ability to use our NOLs in future years in which we have taxable income, we will pay more taxes than if we were able to utilize our NOLs fully, which could have a negative impact on our financial position and results of operations. Additionally, we may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership that we cannot predict or control that could result in further limitations being placed on our ability to utilize our federal NOLs.\nThe Credit Agreement contains various covenants limiting the discretion of our management in operating our business.\nThe Credit Agreement contains various restrictive covenants that may limit our management\u2019s discretion in certain respects. In particular, the agreement limits our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to, among other things:\n\u25cf prepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt;\n\u25cf pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem our capital stock;\n\u25cf make loans and investments;\n\u25cf incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock;\n\u25cf create certain liens;\n\u25cf enter into agreements that restrict dividends or other payments from our restricted subsidiaries to us;\n\u25cf sell assets;\n\u25cf consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets and those of our restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole;\n\u25cf engage in transactions with affiliates;\n\u25cf enter into hedging contracts; and\n\u25cf create unrestricted subsidiaries.\nThe Credit Agreement requires us, as of the last day of any quarter, to maintain commodity hedges covering a minimum of 50% of our projected production for the succeeding twelve months. If our consolidated net leverage ratio equals or exceeds 1.0 to 1.0 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter we will also be required to hedge 35% of our projected production for the next succeeding twelve months. We are also limited to hedging a maximum of 85% of our production from proved reserves. In addition, the Credit Agreement requires us, as of the last day of any quarter to maintain the following ratios (as defined in the Credit Agreement): (i) a consolidated current assets to consolidated current liabilities ratio of not less than 1.0 to 1.0 and (ii) a total debt to last four quarters\u2019 EBITDAX ratio of not greater than 3.5 to 1.0. Factors that may adversely affect our ability to comply with these covenants include oil or natural gas price declines, lack of liquidity in property and capital markets and our inability to execute on our development plan.\nMoreover, the borrowing base limitation in the Credit Agreement is redetermined on April 1 and October 1 of each year and may be the subject of special redeterminations described in the Credit Agreement based on an evaluation of our oil and gas reserves. Because oil and gas prices are principal inputs into the valuation of our reserves, if oil and gas prices decline, our borrowing base could be reduced at the next redetermination date or during future redeterminations. Upon a redetermination, if total outstanding credit exposure exceeds the redetermined borrowing base, we will be required to prepay outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement and we may not have, or be able to obtain, the funds necessary to do so.\nOur debt level and the covenants in the Credit Agreement could negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and business prospects.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had no borrowings and $1 million in letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Agreement with $749 million of available borrowing capacity. The Credit Agreement matures on April 1, 2024. We are allowed to incur additional indebtedness, provided that we meet certain requirements in the Credit Agreement.\nOur level of indebtedness and the covenants contained in the agreements governing our debt could have important consequences for our operations, including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to required payments on debt, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow for working capital, capital expenditures and other general business activities;\n\u25cf limiting our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate and other activities;\n\u25cf increasing the possibility that we may be unable to generate sufficient cash to pay, when due, the principal of, interest on or other amounts due or otherwise refinance our indebtedness;\n\u25cf limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u25cf placing us at a competitive disadvantage relative to other less leveraged competitors;\n\u25cf making us vulnerable to increases in interest rates, because debt under the Credit Agreement is subject to certain rate variability;\n\u25cf making us more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our industry or the economy in general, especially declines in oil and natural gas prices; and\n\u25cf reducing our borrowing base when oil and natural gas prices decline and our ability to maintain compliance with our financial covenants becomes more difficult, which may reduce or eliminate our ability to fund our operations.\nShould we have borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement in the future, we may be required to repay all or a portion of our debt on an accelerated basis in certain circumstances. If we fail to comply with the covenants and other restrictions in the agreements governing our debt, it could lead to an event of default and the acceleration of our repayment of any outstanding debt. Refer to the Risk Factor entitled \u201cThe Credit Agreement contains various covenants limiting the discretion of our management in operating our business.\u201d\nOur development operations require substantial capital, and we may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms, which could lead to a loss of properties and a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves.\nThe oil and gas industry is capital intensive. We make and expect to continue to make substantial capital expenditures in our business and operations for the development, production and acquisition of oil and natural gas reserves. To date, we have financed capital expenditures through a combination of internally generated cash flows, equity and debt issuances, bank borrowings, agreements with industry partners and oil and gas property divestments. We intend to finance future capital expenditures substantially with cash flow from operations, cash on hand and borrowings under the Credit Agreement, although we may seek capital from additional sources as needed. Our cash flow from operations and access to capital is subject to a number of variables, including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf the prices at which oil and natural gas are sold;\n\u25cf our proved reserves;\n\u25cf the level of oil and natural gas we are able to produce from existing wells;\n\u25cf the costs of producing oil and natural gas; and\n\u25cf our ability to acquire, locate and produce new reserves.\nIf our revenues or the borrowing base under the Credit Agreement decrease as a result of lower oil and natural gas prices, operating difficulties, declines in reserves, or for any other reason, then we may have limited ability to obtain the capital necessary to sustain our operations at current levels.\nWe may, from time to time, need to seek additional financing. There can be no assurance as to the availability or terms of any additional financing. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets, particularly in the energy sector, could limit our ability to access these markets or may significantly increase our cost to borrow. If cash generated by operations or availability under the Credit Agreement is not sufficient to meet our capital requirements, the inability to access the cash and credit markets to obtain additional financing, on favorable terms or otherwise, could result in a curtailment of our operations relating to the exploration and development of our prospects, which in turn could lead to a possible loss of properties and a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves.\nIf we are unable to generate enough cash flow from operations to service any indebtedness we incur or are unable to use future borrowings to fund other capital needs, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans, which may have onerous terms or may be unavailable.\nOur earnings and cash flow could vary significantly from year to year due to the volatility of oil and natural gas prices. As a result, the amount of debt that we can manage in some periods may not be appropriate for us in other periods. Additionally, our future cash flow may be insufficient to meet our commitments, including any indebtedness that we may incur in the future under the Credit Agreement or other arrangements. A range of economic, competitive, business and industry factors will affect our future financial performance and, as a result, our ability to generate cash flow from operations and meet our obligations. Factors that may cause us to generate cash flow that is insufficient to meet our obligations include events and risks related to our business, many of which are beyond our control. Any cash flow insufficiency would have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity and our ability to repay or refinance any debt. If we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service any indebtedness we incur, we may be required to undertake various alternative financing plans, which may include:\n\u25cf refinancing or restructuring all or a portion of our debt;\n\u25cf seeking alternative financing or additional capital investment;\n\u25cf selling strategic assets;\n\u25cf reducing or delaying capital investments; or\n\u25cf revising or delaying our strategic plans.\nWe cannot assure you that we would be able to implement any of the above alternative financing plans, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we incur indebtedness in the future and cannot make scheduled payments on that indebtedness or otherwise fail to comply with the covenants and other restrictions in the agreements governing our debt, we will be in default and the lenders under the Credit Agreement could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable. Additionally, the lenders under the Credit Agreement could terminate their commitments to loan money and could foreclose against our assets collateralizing our\nborrowings, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. If the amounts outstanding under our Credit Agreement were to be accelerated, we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full the amounts owed to the lenders. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf oil, NGL and natural gas prices decrease, we may be required to take write-downs of the carrying values of our oil and gas properties.\nAccounting rules require that we periodically review the carrying value of our producing oil and gas properties for possible impairment. Based on specific market factors and circumstances at the time of prospective impairment reviews (which may include depressed oil, NGL and natural gas prices and the continuing evaluation of development plans, production data, economics, possible asset sales and other factors) we may be required to write down the carrying value of our oil and gas properties. For example, we recorded $4.1 billion in impairment charges during 2020 for the partial write-downs of our Williston Basin resource play. A write-down constitutes a non-cash charge to earnings. We may incur additional impairment charges in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations in the period recognized.\nRisks Related to Governmental Regulations, Investor Sentiment, Corporate Governance and Legal Proceedings\nWe are subject to complex laws that can affect the cost, manner or feasibility of doing business and under which we may be subject to substantial liability. The regulatory environment in which we operate changes frequently and may do so in ways that are detrimental to our business.\nDevelopment, production and sale of oil and natural gas are subject to extensive federal, state, local and international regulation. We may be required to make large expenditures to comply with governmental regulations. Matters subject to regulation include, but are not limited to:\n\u25cf discharge permits for drilling operations;\n\u25cf drilling bonds and permits;\n\u25cf reports concerning operations;\n\u25cf hydraulic fracturing;\n\u25cf well spacing and setbacks;\n\u25cf unitization and pooling of properties;\n\u25cf environmental protection;\n\u25cf worker health and safety; and\n\u25cf taxation.\nA summary of the most significant laws and regulations to which we are currently subject is set forth in \u201cBusiness-Government Regulation.\u201d Under these laws and regulations, we could be liable for personal injuries, property damage and other damages. Failure to comply with these laws also may result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative, civil and criminal penalties and litigation. Any such liabilities, penalties, suspensions, terminations or regulatory changes could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. For instance, an accidental release from one of our wells could subject us to substantial liabilities arising from environmental cleanup and restoration costs, claims made by neighboring landowners and other third parties for personal injury and property damage and fines or penalties for related violations of environmental laws or regulations. In addition, strict liability or joint and several liability may be imposed under certain laws, which could cause us to become liable for the conduct of others or for consequences of actions that were legal when taken. Private parties, including the surface owners of properties upon which we drill, may also have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for non-compliance with environmental laws. We may not be able to recover some or any of these costs from insurance. Moreover, federal law and some state laws allow the government to place a lien on real property for costs incurred by the government to address contamination on the property.\nThese laws and regulations can also increase our costs and limit our business activities. For example, these laws and regulations may require the acquisition of a permit before drilling commences; restrict the types, quantities and concentration of materials that can be released into the environment; and limit or prohibit drilling or well completion activities on certain lands. We incur significant costs in our efforts to comply with applicable laws and regulations.\nThe regulatory environment in which we operate changes frequently, often through the imposition of new or more stringent environmental and other requirements, some of which may apply retroactively. We cannot predict the nature, timing, cost or effect of such additional requirements, but they may have a variety of adverse effects on us. Refer to \u201cBusiness-Government Regulation\u201d in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of some potential regulatory changes that could affect our business.\nIssues surrounding climate change and greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for oil and gas that we produce.\nContinuing and increasing political, social and scientific attention to the issue of climate change has resulted in legislative, regulatory and other initiatives, including international agreements, to reduce greenhouse gas (\u201cGHG\u201d) emissions such as carbon dioxide and methane. Policy makers and regulators at the federal and state levels have already imposed, or stated intentions to impose, laws and regulations designed to quantify and limit the emissions of GHG. Refer to \u201cBusiness-Government Regulation-Global Warming and Climate Change\u201d in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of certain existing and proposed laws and regulations intended to address climate change issues. Existing and future laws and regulations relating to climate change and GHG emissions could increase our costs, reduce demand for our products, limit our growth opportunities, impair our ability to develop our reserves and have other adverse effects on our business.\nAlso, in recent years, lawsuits have been brought against other energy companies for matters relating to climate change. Multiple states and localities have also initiated investigations in climate-change related matters. While the current suits focus on a variety of issues, at their core they seek compensation for the effects of climate change from companies with ties to GHG emissions. It is currently unknown what the outcome of these types of actions may be, but the costs of defending against such actions may rise.\nIn addition, many scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHG in the atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, floods and other climatic events. If such effects occur, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and could also limit the type, timing and location of our operations.\nFinally, increased demand for low-carbon or renewable energy sources from consumers could reduce the demand for, and the price of, the products we produce. Technological changes, such as developments in renewable energy and low-carbon transportation, could also adversely affect demand for our products.\nNegative public perception regarding us and/or our industry could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nNegative public perception regarding us and/or our industry resulting from, among other things, concerns raised by advocacy groups about hydraulic fracturing, waste disposal, oil spills, natural gas flaring, seismic activity, climate change, explosions of natural gas transmission lines and the development and operation of pipelines and other midstream facilities may lead to increased regulatory scrutiny, which may, in turn, lead to new state and federal safety and environmental laws, regulations, guidelines and enforcement interpretations. Additionally, environmental groups, landowners, local groups and other advocates may oppose our operations through organized protests, attempts to block or sabotage our operations or those of our midstream transportation providers, intervene in regulatory or administrative proceedings involving our assets or those of our midstream transportation providers, or file lawsuits or other actions designed to prevent, disrupt or delay the development or operation of our assets and business or those of our midstream transportation providers. These actions may cause operational delays or restrictions, increased operating costs, additional regulatory burdens and increased risk of litigation. Moreover, governmental authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing and scope of permit issuance and the public may engage in the permitting process, including through intervention in the courts. Negative public perception could cause the permits we require to conduct our operations to be withheld, delayed or burdened by requirements that restrict our ability to profitably conduct our business.\nRecently, activists concerned about the potential effects of climate change have directed their attention towards sources of funding for fossil-fuel energy companies, which has resulted in certain financial institutions, funds and other sources of capital restricting or eliminating their investment in energy-related activities. Ultimately, this could make it more difficult to secure funding for exploration and production activities.\nA low ESG or sustainability score could result in the exclusion of our common shares from consideration by certain investment funds and a negative perception of us by certain investors.\nCertain organizations that provide corporate governance and other corporate risk information to investors and shareholders have developed scores and ratings to evaluate companies and investment funds based upon environmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) or sustainability metrics. Currently, there are no universal standards for such scores or ratings, but the importance of sustainability evaluations is becoming more broadly accepted by investors and shareholders. Many investment funds focus on positive ESG business practices and sustainability scores when making investments. In addition, investors, particularly institutional investors, use these scores to benchmark companies against their peers and if a company is perceived as lagging, these investors may engage with companies to require improved ESG disclosure or performance. Moreover, certain members of the broader investment community may consider a company\u2019s sustainability score as a reputational or other factor in making an investment decision. Consequently, a low sustainability score could result in exclusion of our common shares from consideration by certain investment funds, engagement by investors seeking to improve such scores and a negative perception of us by certain investors.\nA negative shift in investor sentiment regarding the oil and gas industry could adversely affect our ability to raise debt and equity capital.\nCertain segments of the investor community have developed negative sentiment towards investing in our industry. Historic equity returns in the sector versus other industry sectors have led to lower oil and gas representation in certain key equity market indices. In addition, some investors, including investment advisors and certain sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, university endowments and family foundations, have adopted policies to divest holdings in the oil and gas sector based on social and environmental considerations. Certain other stakeholders have also pressured commercial and investment banks to stop financing oil and gas production and related infrastructure projects.\nSuch developments, including environmental activism and initiatives aimed at limiting climate change and reducing air pollution, could result in downward pressure on the stock prices of oil and gas companies, including ours. This may also potentially result in a reduction of available capital funding for potential acquisitions or development projects, impacting our future financial results.\nWe may be negatively impacted by litigation and legal proceedings, including ongoing claims in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases.\nWe are subject from time to time, and in the future may become subject, to litigation claims. These claims and legal proceedings are typically claims that arise in the normal course of business and include, without limitation, claims relating to environmental, safety and health matters, commercial or contractual disputes with suppliers and customers, claims regarding ownership of mineral interests, including from royalty owners, claims regarding acquisitions and divestitures, regulatory matters and employment and labor matters. We may also become subject to governmental or regulatory proceedings. The outcome of such claims and legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty and some may be resolved unfavorably to us. In addition, the claims resolutions process in connection with our previous filing for and emergence from the voluntary cases under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (the \u201cChapter 11 Cases\u201d) is ongoing and certain of these claims remain subject to the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court. To the extent that these legal proceedings result in claims being allowed against us, such general unsecured claims may be satisfied through the issuance of shares of our common stock or other remedy or agreement under and pursuant to the Plan. As discussed in more detail in the \u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u201d footnote in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading \u201cChapter 11 Cases,\u201d it is possible with respect to certain claims that we could be required or may have the option to make cash payments to resolve claims instead of issuing shares of our common stock or establish reserves and accrue liabilities with respect to such claims at a future date. Alternatively, the resolution of certain claims related to contract rejections or other general unsecured claims may result in the dilution of existing stockholders\u2019 interest. Refer to the Risk Factor entitled \u201cThe exercise of all or any number of outstanding Warrants, the issuance of stock-based awards or the issuance of our common stock to settle the claims of general unsecured claimants may dilute your holding of shares of our common stock\u201d for a discussion of the risks involved in the resolution of certain bankruptcy claims. We may not have insurance that covers such claims and legal proceedings. Successful claims or litigation against us for significant amounts could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Further, even if we are successful in resolving a claim or legal proceeding, the process will require the attention of members of our senior management, reducing the time they have available to devote to managing our business, and may require us to incur substantial legal expenses.\nRisks Related to Our Emergence from Chapter 11 Bankruptcy\nWe previously emerged from bankruptcy, which may adversely affect our business and relationships.\nIt is possible that our having filed for bankruptcy and our previous emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases may adversely affect our business and relationships with customers, vendors, contractors, employees or suppliers. For example:\n\u25cf key suppliers, vendors or other contractual counterparties may require additional financial assurances or enhanced performance from us or demand increased fees for their goods or services;\n\u25cf our ability to renew existing contracts and compete for new business may be adversely affected;\n\u25cf our ability to attract, motivate and/or retain key employees and executives may be adversely affected;\n\u25cf landowners may not be willing to lease acreage to us; and\n\u25cf competitors may take business away from us and our ability to attract and retain customers may be negatively impacted.\nThe occurrence of one or more of these events could have a material and adverse effect on our operations, financial condition and reputation. We cannot assure you that having been subject to bankruptcy protection will not adversely affect our operations in the future.\nOur actual and future financial results after emergence from bankruptcy may not be comparable to our historical financial information as a result of the implementation of our chapter 11 plan of reorganization (the \u201cPlan\u201d) and the transactions contemplated thereby.\nOur capital structure was significantly impacted by the Plan. Under fresh start accounting rules that applied to us upon our emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases on September 1, 2020 (the \u201cEmergence Date\u201d), assets and liabilities were adjusted to fair values. Accordingly, because fresh start accounting rules applied, our current and future financial condition and results of operations following the Emergence Date from the Chapter 11 Cases will not be comparable to the financial condition and results of operations reflected in our historical financial statements prior to the Emergence Date.\nThe exercise of all or any number of outstanding Warrants, the issuance of stock-based awards or the issuance of our common stock to settle the claims of general unsecured claimants may dilute your holding of shares of our common stock.\nAs of the date of filing this report, we have outstanding Warrants (as defined in the \u201cShareholders\u2019 Equity\u201d footnote in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading \u201cWarrants\u201d) to purchase approximately 7.3 million shares of our common stock at exercise prices of either $73.44 or $83.45 per share. In the event that a holder of Warrants elects to exercise their option to acquire shares of common stock, we shall issue a net number of exercised shares of common stock. In addition, as of December 31, 2021, approximately 2.1 million shares of our common stock remained available for grant under the Whiting Petroleum Corporation 2020 Equity Incentive Plan. We also reserved approximately 3.0 million shares of our common stock for potential future distribution to certain general unsecured claimants for claims pending resolution in the Bankruptcy Court. In February 2021, we issued 948,897 shares out of this reserve to a general unsecured claimant in full settlement of such claimant\u2019s claims pending before the Bankruptcy Court and for rejection damages relating to an executory contract. Refer to the \u201cShareholders\u2019 Equity\u201d footnote in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information. The exercise of the Warrants, the issuance or exercise of equity awards that we may grant in the future, the issuance of our common stock to general unsecured claimants or the sale of shares of our common stock issued for other reasons would dilute the interests of existing shareholders and could have a material adverse effect on the market for our common stock, including the price that an investor could obtain for their shares.", "PERMNO": 89901, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "WLL"}
