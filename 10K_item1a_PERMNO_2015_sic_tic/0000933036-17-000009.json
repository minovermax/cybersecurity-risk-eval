{"cik": "933036", "company": "RENT A CENTER INC DE", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision. We believe these are all the material risks currently facing our business. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by these risks. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment. You should also refer to the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes.\nOur success depends on the effective implementation and continued execution of our strategies.\nOur Core U.S. store base is mature and our Acceptance Now business operates in an intensively competitive environment. We recently completed a multi-year program designed to address these dynamics by transforming and modernizing our operations in order to improve the profitability of the Core U.S. segment while continuing to grow profitably our Acceptance Now segment. We remain focused on strengthening our Core business while continuing to build upon Acceptance Now's recent success with signing pilot agreements with two new national retailers representing a significant scale opportunity. We will continue to review strategic priorities and opportunities in both businesses to enhance value.\nIn order to position the Company for long-term growth and profitability, we are taking important steps to drive operational improvements, including:\n\u2022\nachieving an optimal product mix by shifting to a higher concentration of the higher-end, aspirational products that our customers want, and which have always helped make Rent-A-Center a leader in the rent-to-own industry;\n\u2022\nproviding a better value proposition and being more customer centric, which will help us extend average rental time, translating to happier, more loyal customers that return to us in the future;\n\u2022\nstabilizing our workforce by adding back a full-time co-worker to most of our stores, as we believe that investing in the frontline will improve customer satisfaction and business results;\n\u2022\nutilizing technology investments and new capabilities to enable or accelerate business strategies and find innovative, engaging ways to better serve customers; and\n\u2022\nimplementing a streamlined collection process and enhancing customer service through employee training to reduce delinquencies and collection times.\nThere is no assurance that we will be able to implement and execute these strategic initiatives in accordance with our expectations. Higher costs or failure to achieve targeted results associated with the implementation of such new programs or initiatives could adversely affect our results of operations or negatively impact our ability to successfully execute future strategies, which may result in an adverse impact on our business and financial results.\nWe are highly dependent on the financial performance of our Core U.S. operating segment.\nOur financial performance is highly dependent on our Core U.S. segment, which comprised approximately 70% of our consolidated net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016. Any significant decrease in the financial performance of the Core U.S. segment may also have a material adverse impact on our ability to implement our growth strategies.\nWe are in a management transition period in which the individuals serving as both our chief executive officer and chief financial officer are acting in interim roles. We may not be able to effectively operate and execute our strategies during this interim period and may encounter difficulties or delays in identifying and attracting a permanent chief executive officer and chief financial officer, each with the required level of experience and expertise.\nOn December 2, 2016, Guy J. Constant resigned as Executive Vice President - Finance, Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer of the Company, and Maureen B. Short was named as Interim Chief Financial Officer. On January 9, 2017, Robert D. Davis resigned as Chief Executive Officer and a director of the Company. On that date, our founder, former chief executive officer, and Chairman of the Board, Mark E. Speese, was named as Interim Chief Executive Officer. We are in the process of searching for a permanent chief executive officer and chief financial officer. However, if we are unsuccessful in appointing a chief executive officer and a chief financial officer each with the required level of experience and expertise in a timely manner, our operations and business strategies could be materially and adversely affected. Any significant leadership change or executive management transition creates uncertainty, involves inherent risk, and may involve a diversion of resources and management attention, be disruptive to our daily operations or impact public or market perception, any of which could negatively impact our ability to operate effectively or execute our strategies and result in a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur ability to attract and retain key employees may be adversely impacted by the recent executive departures and resulting management transition, and our recent financial results.\nExecutive leadership transitions can be inherently difficult to manage and may cause disruption to our business. As a result of the recent changes in our executive management team, our existing management team has taken on substantially more responsibility,\nwhich has resulted in greater workload demands and could divert their attention away from other key areas of our business. In addition, management transition inherently causes some loss of institutional knowledge, which can negatively affect strategy and execution, and our results of operations and financial condition could suffer as a result.\nOur future success depends in large part upon our ability to attract and retain key management executives and other key employees. In order to attract and retain executives and other key employees in a competitive marketplace, we must provide a competitive compensation package, including cash and equity compensation. Because of our lower than expected operating results for the year ended December 31, 2016, our senior management did not earn any amounts under the annual cash incentive plan for 2016, and salary increases and future cash incentive compensation opportunities could be limited. In addition, our long-term incentive program includes equity awards in the form of stock options and restricted stock units. Any prolonged inability to provide salary increases or cash incentive compensation opportunities, or if the anticipated value of such equity awards does not materialize or our equity compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit, our ability to attract, retain and motivate executives and key employees could be weakened. In addition the uncertainty and operational disruptions caused by the management changes and related transitions could result in additional key employees deciding to leave the Company. If we are unable to retain, attract and motivate talented employees with the appropriate skill sets, we may not achieve our objectives and our results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nFailure to effectively manage our costs could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.\nCertain elements of our cost structure are largely fixed in nature. Consumer spending remains uncertain, which makes it more challenging for us to maintain or increase our operating income in the Core U.S. segment. The competitiveness in our industry and increasing price transparency means that the focus on achieving efficient operations is greater than ever. As a result, we must continuously focus on managing our cost structure. Failure to manage our labor and benefit rates, advertising and marketing expenses, operating leases, charge-offs due to customer stolen merchandise, other store expenses or indirect spending could materially adversely affect our profitability.\nOur Acceptance Now segment depends on the success of our third-party retail partners and our continued relationship with them.\nOur Acceptance Now segment revenues depend in part on the ability of unaffiliated third-party retailers to attract customers. The failure of our third-party retail partners to maintain quality and consistency in their operations and their ability to continue to provide products and services, or the loss of the relationship with any of these third-party retailers and an inability to replace them, could cause our Acceptance Now segment to lose customers, substantially decreasing the revenues and earnings of our Acceptance Now segment. This could adversely affect our financial results. In 2016, approximately 73% of the total revenue of the Acceptance Now segment originated at our Acceptance Now kiosks located in stores operated by six retail partners. We may be unable to continue growing the Acceptance Now segment if we are unable to find third-party retailers willing to partner with us or if we are unable to enter into agreements with third-party retailers acceptable to us.\nThe success of our business is dependent on factors affecting consumer spending that are not under our control.\nConsumer spending is affected by general economic conditions and other factors including levels of employment, disposable consumer income, prevailing interest rates, consumer debt and availability of credit, costs of fuel, inflation, recession and fears of recession, war and fears of war, pandemics, inclement weather, tax rates and rate increases, timing of receipt of tax refunds, consumer confidence in future economic conditions and political conditions, and consumer perceptions of personal well-being and security. Unfavorable changes in factors affecting discretionary spending could reduce demand for our products and services resulting in lower revenue and negatively impacting the business and its financial results.\nIf we are unable to compete effectively with the growing e-commerce sector, our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nWith the continued expansion of Internet use, as well as mobile computing devices and smartphones, competition from the e-commerce sector continues to grow. We have launched virtual capabilities within our Acceptance Now and Core U.S. segments. There can be no assurance we will be able to grow our e-commerce business in a profitable manner. Certain of our competitors, and a number of e-commerce retailers, have established e-commerce operations against which we compete for customers. It is possible that the increasing competition from the e-commerce sector may reduce our market share, gross margin, and operating margin, and may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations in other ways.\nDisruptions in our supply chain and other factors affecting the distribution of our merchandise could adversely impact our business.\nAny disruption in the operation of our distribution centers could result in our inability to meet our customers\u2019 expectations, higher costs, an inability to stock our stores or longer lead time associated with distributing merchandise. Any such disruption within our\nsupply chain network, including damage or destruction to one of our five regional distribution centers, could result in decreased net sales, increased costs and reduced profits.\nOur debt agreements impose restrictions on us which may limit or prohibit us from engaging in certain transactions. If a default were to occur, our lenders could accelerate the amounts of debt outstanding, and holders of our secured indebtedness could force us to sell our assets to satisfy all or a part of what is owed.\nCovenants under our senior credit facilities and the indenture governing our outstanding senior unsecured notes restrict our ability to pay dividends and engage in various operational matters. In addition, covenants under our senior credit facilities require us to maintain specified financial ratios. Our ability to meet these financial ratios may be affected by events beyond our control. These restrictions could limit our ability to obtain future financing, make needed capital expenditures or other investments, repurchase our outstanding debt or equity, pay dividends, withstand a future downturn in our business or in the economy, dispose of operations, engage in mergers, acquire additional stores or otherwise conduct necessary corporate activities. Various transactions that we may view as important opportunities, are also subject to the consent of lenders under the senior credit facilities, which may be withheld or granted subject to conditions specified at the time that may affect the attractiveness or viability of the transaction.\nIf a default were to occur, the lenders under our senior credit facilities could accelerate the amounts outstanding under the credit facilities. In addition, the lenders under these agreements could terminate their commitments to lend to us. If the lenders under these agreements accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we may not have sufficient liquid assets at that time to repay the amounts then outstanding under our indebtedness or be able to find additional alternative financing. Even if we could obtain additional alternative financing, the terms of the financing may not be favorable or acceptable to us.\nThe existing indebtedness under our senior credit facilities is secured by substantially all of our assets. Should a default or acceleration of this indebtedness occur, the holders of this indebtedness could sell the assets to satisfy all or a part of what is owed.\nOur current insurance program may expose us to unexpected costs and negatively affect our financial performance.\nOur insurance coverage is subject to deductibles, self-insured retentions, limits of liability and similar provisions that we believe are prudent based on our operations. Because we self-insure a significant portion of expected losses under our workers' compensation, general liability, vehicle and group health insurance programs, unanticipated changes in any applicable actuarial assumptions and management estimates underlying our recorded liabilities for these losses, including potential increases in medical and indemnity costs, could result in materially different amounts of expense than expected under these programs. This could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations in Mexico are subject to political or regulatory changes and significant changes in the economic environment and other concerns.\nWe opened our first store in Mexico in October 2010, and operated 130 stores in Mexico as of December 31, 2016. Changes in the business, regulatory or political climate in Mexico could adversely affect our operations there. Mexico is also subject to certain potential risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control, such as violence, social unrest, enforcement of property rights and public safety and security that could restrict or eliminate our ability to open new or operate some or all of our locations in Mexico, or significantly reduce customer traffic or demand. In addition, our assets, investments in, earnings from and dividends from our Mexican subsidiaries must be translated to U.S. dollars from the Mexican peso. Accordingly, we are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations of the exchange rate for the Mexican peso which may have an impact on our future costs or on future cash flows from our Mexico operations, and could adversely affect our financial performance.\nFailure to improve our financial performance in Mexico could result in our taking actions that may change or impact our projected results in the future.\nWe are pursuing several operational initiatives designed to improve the financial performance of our operations in Mexico. If we are unable to achieve an acceptable level of profitability in Mexico, we will consider all available alternatives for our operations in Mexico, some of which may change or impact our projected results in the future.\nOur transactions are regulated by and subject to the requirements of various federal and state laws and regulations, which may require significant compliance costs and expose us to litigation. Any negative change in these laws or the passage of unfavorable new laws could require us to alter our business practices in a manner that may be materially adverse to us.\nCurrently, 46 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico have passed laws that regulate rental purchase transactions as separate and distinct from credit sales. One additional state has a retail installment sales statute that excludes leases, including rent-to-own transactions, from its coverage if the lease provides for more than a nominal purchase price at the end of the rental period. The specific rental purchase laws generally require certain contractual and advertising disclosures. They also provide varying levels of substantive consumer protection, such as requiring a grace period for late fees and contract reinstatement rights in the event the\nrental purchase agreement is terminated. The rental purchase laws of ten states limit the total amount that may be charged over the life of a rental purchase agreement and the laws of five states limit the cash prices for which we may offer merchandise.\nSimilar to other consumer transactions, our rental purchase transaction is also governed by various federal and state consumer protection statutes. These consumer protection statutes, as well as the rental purchase statutes under which we operate, provide various consumer remedies, including monetary penalties, for violations. In our history, we have been the subject of litigation alleging that we have violated some of these statutory provisions.\nAlthough there is currently no comprehensive federal legislation regulating rental purchase transactions, adverse federal legislation may be enacted in the future. From time to time, both favorable and adverse legislation seeking to regulate our business has been introduced in Congress. In addition, various legislatures in the states where we currently do business may adopt new legislation or amend existing legislation that could require us to alter our business practices in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur reputation, ability to do business and operating results may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents or business partners.\nOur operations in the U.S. and abroad are subject to certain laws generally prohibiting companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions. Our employees, contractors or agents may violate the policies and procedures we have implemented to ensure compliance with these laws. Any such improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions, could lead to substantial civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, and related shareholder lawsuits, could cause us to incur significant legal fees, and could damage our reputation.\nWe may be subject to legal proceedings from time to time which seek material damages. The costs we incur in defending ourselves or associated with settling any of these proceedings, as well as a material final judgment or decree against us, could materially adversely affect our financial condition by requiring the payment of the settlement amount, a judgment or the posting of a bond.\nIn our history, we have defended class action lawsuits alleging various regulatory violations and have paid material amounts to settle such claims. Significant settlement amounts or final judgments could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources. The failure to pay any material judgment would be a default under our senior credit facilities and the indenture governing our outstanding senior unsecured notes.\nOur operations are dependent on effective information management systems. Failure of these systems could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe utilize integrated information management systems. The efficient operation of our business is dependent on these systems to effectively manage our financial and operational data. The failure of our information management systems to perform as designed, loss of data or any interruption of our information management systems for a significant period of time could disrupt our business. If the information management systems sustain repeated failures, we may not be able to manage our store operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are currently investing in new information management technology and systems and implementing modifications and upgrades to existing systems to support our growth plan. These investments include replacing legacy systems, making changes to existing systems, building redundancies, and acquiring new systems and hardware with updated functionality. We are taking appropriate actions to ensure the successful implementation of these initiatives, including the testing of new systems and the transfer of existing data, with minimal disruptions to the business. These efforts may take longer and may require greater financial and other resources than anticipated, may cause distraction of key personnel, may cause disruptions to our existing systems and our business, and may not provide the anticipated benefits. The disruption in our information management systems, or our inability to improve, upgrade, integrate or expand our systems to meet our evolving business requirements, could impair our ability to achieve critical strategic initiatives and could materially adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn the third quarter of 2016, we experienced unexpected capacity-related system outages of our new store information management system in our Core U.S. stores which negatively impacted our third quarter operating results. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we implemented software releases to improve stability and added hardware to help mitigate over-utilization issues. As a result, we did not experience any additional capacity-related outages in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nIf we fail to protect the integrity and security of customer and employee information, we could be exposed to litigation or regulatory enforcement and our business could be adversely impacted.\nWe collect and store certain personal information provided to us by our customers and employees in the ordinary course of our business. Despite instituted safeguards for the protection of such information, we cannot be certain that all of our systems are\nentirely free from vulnerability to attack. Computer hackers may attempt to penetrate our network security and, if successful, misappropriate confidential customer or employee information. In addition, one of our employees, contractors or other third party with whom we do business may attempt to circumvent our security measures in order to obtain such information, or inadvertently cause a breach involving such information. Loss of customer or employee information could disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and expose us to claims from customers, employees, regulators and other persons, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the costs associated with information security, such as increased investment in technology, the costs of compliance with privacy laws, and costs incurred to prevent or remediate information security breaches, could adversely impact our business.\nA change of control could accelerate our obligation to pay our outstanding indebtedness, and we may not have sufficient liquid assets at that time to repay these amounts.\nUnder our senior credit facilities, an event of default would result if a third party became the beneficial owner of 35.0% or more of our voting stock or upon certain changes in the constitution of Rent-A-Center\u2019s Board of Directors. As of December 31, 2016, $191.8 million was outstanding under our senior credit facilities.\nUnder the indenture governing our outstanding senior unsecured notes, in the event of a change in control, we may be required to offer to purchase all of our outstanding senior unsecured notes at 101% of their original aggregate principal amount, plus accrued interest to the date of repurchase. A change in control also would result in an event of default under our senior credit facilities, which would allow our lenders to accelerate indebtedness owed to them.\nIf a specified change in control occurs and the lenders under our debt instruments accelerate these obligations, we may not have sufficient liquid assets to repay amounts outstanding under these agreements.\nRent-A-Center's organizational documents and our debt instruments contain provisions that may prevent or deter another group from paying a premium over the market price to Rent-A-Center's stockholders to acquire its stock.\nRent-A-Center\u2019s organizational documents contain provisions that classify its Board of Directors, authorize its Board of Directors to issue blank check preferred stock and establish advance notice requirements on its stockholders for director nominations and actions to be taken at meetings of the stockholders. In addition, as a Delaware corporation, Rent-A-Center is subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law relating to business combinations. Our senior credit facilities and the indentures governing our senior unsecured notes each contain various change of control provisions which, in the event of a change of control, would cause a default under those provisions. These provisions and arrangements could delay, deter or prevent a merger, consolidation, tender offer or other business combination or change of control involving us that could include a premium over the market price of Rent-A-Center\u2019s common stock that some or a majority of Rent-A-Center\u2019s stockholders might consider to be in their best interests.\nRent-A-Center is a holding company and is dependent on the operations and funds of its subsidiaries.\nRent-A-Center is a holding company, with no revenue generating operations and no assets other than its ownership interests in its direct and indirect subsidiaries. Accordingly, Rent-A-Center is dependent on the cash flow generated by its direct and indirect operating subsidiaries and must rely on dividends or other intercompany transfers from its operating subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to meet its obligations, including the obligations under the senior credit facilities. The ability of Rent-A-Center\u2019s subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to it is subject to applicable state laws. Should one or more of Rent-A-Center\u2019s subsidiaries be unable to pay dividends or make distributions, its ability to meet its ongoing obligations could be materially and adversely impacted.\nOur stock price is volatile, and you may not be able to recover your investment if our stock price declines.\nThe price of our common stock has been volatile and can be expected to be significantly affected by factors such as:\n\u2022\nour ability to meet market expectations with respect to the growth and profitability of each of our operating segments;\n\u2022\nquarterly variations in our results of operations, which may be impacted by, among other things, changes in same store sales or when and how many locations we acquire or open;\n\u2022\nquarterly variations in our competitors\u2019 results of operations;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates or buy/sell recommendations by financial analysts; and\n\u2022\nthe stock price performance of comparable companies.\nIn addition, the stock market as a whole historically has experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many specialty retailers in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies' operating performance.\nFailure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports, our brand and operating results could be harmed. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.\nWhile we continue to evaluate and improve our internal controls, we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations.\nIf we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, as such standards are modified, supplemented or amended from time to time, we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a material adverse effect on our stock price.", "PERMNO": 81222, "SIC": 7350, "TIC": "RCII"}
