Certain important factors may have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations, and you should carefully consider them. Accordingly, in evaluating our business, we encourage you to consider the following discussion of risk factors, in its entirety, in addition to other information contained in or incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our other public filings with the SEC.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Capital\nWe are not currently profitable and may never become profitable.\nWe had net losses of $182.8 million, $101.5 million, and $62.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $628.6 million. Until we succeed in developing and then commercializing one or more of our product candidates, we expect to incur substantial losses and may never achieve or maintain profitability. We also expect to continue to incur significant operating and capital expenditures and anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially as we:\n\u2022\ncontinue to undertake preclinical development and clinical trials for product candidates;\n\u2022\nseek regulatory approvals for product candidates;\n\u2022\ncontinue to build our commercial infrastructure, including adding internal systems and hiring additional personnel; and\n\u2022\ncommercialize abaloparatide-SC or any other product candidates, in each case if approved.\nWe also expect to experience negative cash flow as we fund our operating losses and capital expenditures. As a result, we will need to generate significant revenues in order to achieve and maintain profitability. Accordingly, unless and until we generate revenues and become profitable, we will need to raise additional capital to continue to operate our business. Our failure to achieve or maintain profitability or to raise additional capital could negatively impact the value of our securities.\nWe currently have no product revenues and unless we generate revenues and become profitable, we expect that we will need to raise additional capital, which may not be available on favorable terms, if at all, in order to continue operating our business.\nTo date, we have generated no product revenues. Until, and unless, we receive approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, or foreign regulatory authorities for our product candidates, we will not be permitted to sell our drugs and will not have product revenues. Currently, our only product candidates are abaloparatide-SC, abaloparatide-TD, RAD1901 and RAD140, and none of these product candidates have been approved by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities for sale. In March 2016, we submitted an NDA to the FDA for abaloparatide-SC, which was accepted for filing by the FDA with a PDUFA date of March 30, 2017. Even if our NDA for abaloparatide-SC is approved, we would still expect to incur significant expenses and net losses as we begin our first commercialization efforts for abaloparatide-SC and continue development and commercialization efforts for our other product candidates. Therefore, for the foreseeable future, we will have to fund our operations and capital expenditures with our existing cash and cash equivalents and short and long-term marketable securities, or through strategic financing opportunities, that could include, but are not limited to partnering or other collaboration agreements, future offerings of our equity, royalty-based financing arrangements, and/or the incurrence of debt.\nBased upon our cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities balance at December 31, 2016, we believe that, prior to the consideration of revenue from the potential future sales of any of our investigational products that may receive regulatory approval, we have sufficient capital to fund our development plans, U.S. commercial scale-up and other operational activities into 2018. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use up our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. If we fail to obtain additional capital, we may be unable to complete our planned preclinical and clinical trials and obtain approval of product candidates from the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities. In addition, we could be forced to discontinue product development, reduce or forego sales and marketing efforts for any product candidate that is approved, forego attractive business opportunities or discontinue our operations entirely. Any additional sources of financing may not be available or may not be available on favorable terms and will likely involve the issuance of additional equity securities, which will have a dilutive effect on stockholders. Our future\ncapital requirements will depend on many factors, including the scope and progress made in our research and development activities and our clinical studies and the expenses associated with our commercialization efforts for abaloparatide-SC.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or product candidates.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of collaborations, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements, other marketing and distribution arrangements, equity offerings, royalty-based financing arrangements and debt financings. We do not have any committed external source of funds. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a stockholder. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through marketing and distribution arrangements or other collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties or royalty-based financing arrangements, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates, or we may need to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nWe are a company with a limited operating history upon which to base an investment decision.\nWe are a company with a limited operating history and have not demonstrated an ability to perform the functions necessary for the successful commercialization of abaloparatide-SC or any of our other product candidates. The successful commercialization of abaloparatide-SC or any product candidates will require us to perform a variety of functions, including:\n\u2022\nconducting sales and marketing activities for products if approved,\n\u2022\ncontinuing to undertake preclinical development and clinical trials;\n\u2022\nparticipating in regulatory approval processes; and\n\u2022\nformulating and manufacturing products.\nOur operations have been limited to organizing and staffing our company, acquiring, developing and securing our proprietary technology and undertaking preclinical and clinical trials of our product candidates. These operations provide a limited basis for you to assess our ability to commercialize our product candidates and the advisability of investing further in our securities.\nOur financial results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter, which makes our results difficult to predict and could cause our results to fall short of expectations.\nOur financial results may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control. For these reasons, comparing our financial results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful, and you should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance. Particularly over the near term as we continue to build our commercial capabilities and, if approved, commercialize abaloparatide-SC, our revenues, if any, may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and our future quarterly and annual expenses as a percentage of our revenues may be significantly different from those we have recorded in the past or which we expect for the future. Our financial results in some quarters may fall below expectations. Any of these events as well as the various risk factors listed in this \"Risk Factors\" section could adversely affect our financial results and cause our stock price to fall.\nOur cash and cash equivalents could be adversely affected if the financial institutions in which we hold our cash and cash equivalents fail.\nWe regularly maintain cash balances at third-party financial institutions in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limit. While we monitor daily the cash balances in the operating accounts and adjust the balances as appropriate, these balances could be impacted, and there could be a material adverse effect on our business, if one or more of the financial institutions with which we deposit fails or is subject to other adverse conditions in the financial or credit markets. To date, we have experienced no loss or lack of access to our invested cash or cash equivalents; however, we can provide no assurance that access to our invested cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial and credit markets.\nOur investments in marketable securities are subject to market, interest and credit risk that may reduce their value.\nThe value of our investments in marketable securities may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates, downgrades in the creditworthiness of any bonds we hold, turmoil in the credit markets and financial services industry and by other factors which may result in other than temporary declines in the value of our investments. Decreases in the market value of our marketable securities could have an adverse impact on our statements of financial position, results of operations and cash flow.\nWe are subject to foreign currency risk.\nA significant portion of our clinical trial activities, in addition to our contract manufacturing processes in support of abaloparatide-SC, are conducted outside of the United States and a large portion of the costs incurred with these activities are denominated in the local currency of the country in which the activity is being conducted. As such, these costs could be subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. At present, we do not engage in hedging transactions to protect against uncertainty in future exchange rates between foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar. A decline in the value of the U.S. dollar against currencies in geographies in which we conduct clinical trial or contract manufacturing activities could have a negative impact on our research and development costs, our future inventory valuations, or our future cost of sales. We cannot predict the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, and foreign currency fluctuations in the future may adversely affect our business and our results of operations. For further discussion of our foreign currency risks, see \u201cItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d.\nAn adverse determination in any current or future lawsuits or arbitration proceedings to which we are a party could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are currently involved in a pending arbitration proceeding. In November 2016, we received notice that in October 2016, Ipsen Pharma SAS, or Ipsen, had initiated arbitration proceedings against us in the International Chamber of Commerce\u2019s International Court of Arbitration. Ipsen\u2019s Request for Arbitration alleges that we breached various provisions of the License Agreement concerning abaloparatide, including with regard to Ipsen's right to co-promote abaloparatide in France and a license from us with respect to Japan. Ipsen seeks declaratory relief, compliance with the License Agreement, damages, costs and fees as a result of the purported breaches, and alleges the monetary value of these claims is approximately \u20ac50 million. In January 2017, we submitted an Answer denying Ipsen\u2019s claims and alleging counterclaims against Ipsen for breach of the License Agreement and other declaratory judgment. We asserted, among other things, that Ipsen's claimed rights to co-promote abaloparatide in France and to a license from us with respect to Japan have permanently expired, and that Ipsen has breached the License Agreement by, among other things, allowing certain patents to expire and by purporting to license to a third party certain manufacturing and other rights that we contend Ipsen exclusively licensed to us. In February 2017, Ipsen submitted a Reply denying our counterclaims and alleging that we are precluded from asserting them. We are seeking dismissal of Ipsen\u2019s claims, as well as declaratory relief, compliance with the License Agreement, and other damages, costs and fees to be determined by the Arbitral Tribunal. However, if such defense is unsuccessful, and Ipsen prevails on any of its claims, such an adverse determination could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and liquidity.\nAdditionally, we may be the target of claims asserting violations of securities fraud and derivative actions, or other litigation or arbitration proceedings in the future. Any future litigation or arbitration proceedings could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources. These lawsuits or arbitration proceedings may result in large judgments or settlements against us, any of which could have a material adverse effect on its business, operating results, financial condition and liquidity.\nWe are also subject to a variety of other types of potential claims, proceedings, investigations and litigation which may be initiated by government agencies or third parties. These include compliance matters, product regulation or safety, taxes, employee benefit plans, employment discrimination, health and safety, environmental, antitrust, customs, import/export, government contract compliance, financial controls or reporting, intellectual property, allegations of misrepresentation, false claims or false statements, commercial claims, claims regarding promotion of our product candidates, or other similar matters. In addition, government investigations related to the use of products, but not the efficacy themselves, may cause reputational harm to us. Negative publicity-whether accurate or inaccurate-about the efficacy, safety or side effects of our product candidates or product categories, whether involving us or a competitor, could materially reduce market acceptance for our product candidates, cause consumers to seek alternatives to our product candidates, result in product withdrawals and cause our stock price to decline. Negative publicity could also result in an increased number of product liability claims, whether or not these claims have a basis in scientific fact. Any such claims, proceedings, investigations or litigation, regardless of the merits, might result in substantial costs, restrictions on product use or sales, or otherwise injure our business.\nRisks Related to the Discovery, Development and Commercialization of Our Product Candidates\nWe are heavily dependent on the success of our investigational product candidate abaloparatide-SC. We cannot be certain that abaloparatide-SC will receive regulatory approval or be successfully commercialized even if we receive regulatory approval.\nAbaloparatide-SC is our only product candidate in late-stage clinical development, and our business currently depends heavily on its successful development, regulatory approval and commercialization. We have no drug products for sale currently and may never be able to develop approved and marketable drug products. The research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, approval, sale, marketing and distribution of drug products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities in the United States and other countries, which regulations differ from country to country. We are not permitted to market abaloparatide-SC in the United States unless and until we receive approval of an NDA from the FDA, or in any foreign countries unless and until we receive the requisite approval from regulatory authorities in those foreign countries. In addition, the approval of abaloparatide-TD as a potential line extension to abaloparatide-SC is dependent on the earlier approval of abaloparatide-SC. Obtaining approval of a product candidate is an extensive, lengthy, expensive and uncertain process, and any approval of abaloparatide-SC may be delayed, limited or denied for many reasons, including:\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to demonstrate that abaloparatide is safe and effective as a treatment for reduction of fracture risk in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis to the satisfaction of the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\nthe results of our clinical studies may not meet the level of statistical or clinical significance required for marketing approval;\n\u2022\nthe FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with the number, design, size, conduct or implementation of our clinical studies;\n\u2022\nany clinical research organizations, or CROs, that we have retained or may in the future retain, to conduct clinical studies may take actions outside of our control that materially adversely impact our clinical studies;\n\u2022\nthe FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may not accept data generated at our clinical study sites;\n\u2022\nthe FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may not find the data from preclinical studies and clinical studies sufficient to demonstrate that abaloparatide's clinical and other benefits outweigh its safety risks;\n\u2022\nthe FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with our interpretation of data from our preclinical studies and clinical studies or may require that we conduct additional studies;\n\u2022\nthe FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may not agree with our proposed labeling and may require labeling that undermines or otherwise significantly impairs the commercial value of the product if it were to be approved with such labeling;\n\u2022\nthe FDA may require development of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, as a condition of approval;\n\u2022\nif our NDA is reviewed by an advisory committee, the FDA may have difficulties scheduling an advisory committee meeting in a timely manner or the advisory committee may recommend against approval of our application or may recommend that the FDA require, as a condition of approval, additional preclinical studies or clinical studies, limitations on approved labeling or distribution and use restrictions; or\n\u2022\nthe FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may identify deficiencies in the manufacturing processes or facilities of our third-party manufacturers.\nIn addition, the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may change its approval policies or adopt new regulations. For example, on February 15, 2012, we received a letter from the FDA stating that, after internal consideration, the FDA believes that a minimum of 24-month fracture data are necessary for approval of new products for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Our abaloparatide-SC pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial is designed to produce fracture data based on an 18-month primary endpoint. Based on our discussions with the FDA, we believe that continued use of the 18-month primary endpoint will be acceptable, provided that our NDA includes the 24-month fracture data derived from the first six months' extension of the abaloparatide 80 \u00b5g and placebo groups in our Phase 3 study, which groups received an approved alendronate (generic Fosamax) therapy for osteoporosis management. The NDA that we submitted to the FDA in March 2016 for abaloparatide-SC as a proposed treatment for osteoporosis included the 24-month fracture data. We cannot be certain that the FDA will be supportive of this plan, will not change this approval policy again or will not adopt other approval policies or regulations that adversely affect any NDA that we may submit, the occurrence of any of which may further delay FDA approval.\nWe cannot assure you that we will receive the approvals necessary to commercialize abaloparatide-SC, or any of our product candidates, including any product candidates we are currently developing or may acquire or develop in the future. In order to obtain FDA approval of abaloparatide-SC, or any product candidate, we must submit to the FDA an NDA demonstrating that the product candidate is safe for humans and effective for its indicated use. This demonstration requires significant research and animal tests, which are referred to as preclinical studies, as well as human tests, which are referred to as clinical trials. Satisfaction of the FDA's regulatory requirements typically takes many years, depends upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidate and requires substantial resources for research, development and testing. We cannot predict whether our research and clinical approaches will result in drugs that the FDA considers safe for humans and effective for proposed uses.\nIn 2007, we entered into a global pharmacovigilance agreement with Teijin Limited, or Teijin, a Japanese pharmaceutical company, that provides for the exchange of information related to serious and non-serious adverse reactions to abaloparatide by patients enrolled in clinical studies. The purpose of the agreement is to enable safety reporting to global health agencies. Teijin has completed a Phase 2 clinical study of abaloparatide-SC in Japan for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Should Teijin advise us in accordance with our agreement of a serious adverse event experienced by patients enrolled in their study, we would need to report the serious adverse event to the FDA and the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, which could adversely affect or delay our ability to obtain regulatory approvals in the United States and Europe.\nIn addition, the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities each has substantial discretion in the drug approval process and may require us to conduct additional preclinical and clinical testing or to perform post-marketing studies. The approval process may also be delayed by changes in government regulation, future legislation or administrative action or changes in FDA policy that occur prior to or during its regulatory review, such as the request we received from the FDA with respect to providing a minimum of 24-month fracture data for approval of abaloparatide-SC. Delays in obtaining regulatory approvals may:\n\u2022\ndelay commercialization of, and our ability to derive product revenues from, our product candidates;\n\u2022\nimpose costly procedures on us; and\n\u2022\ndiminish any competitive advantages that we may otherwise enjoy.\nThe abaloparatide-SC finished product is a drug/device combination product candidate with both a drug and device component and with the primary mode of action being provided by the investigational drug abaloparatide. Based on our discussions to date with the FDA, we believe that abaloparatide-SC will be regulated as a combination product by the FDA, and both drug and device components will be required for review as part of our NDA submission. In March 2016, we submitted our NDA for abaloparatide-SC to the FDA which was accepted for filing by the FDA with a PDUFA date of March 30, 2017. In addition, there are device-related manufacturing and other regulatory requirements (e.g., current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs, and adverse event reporting) to which we may be subject by virtue of the product's status as a drug/device combination product. As a result of these factors, we may experience delays in the product development and regulatory review and approval process in seeking a drug/device combination product approval under an NDA.\nEven though our NDA for abaloparatide-SC was accepted for filing, the FDA retains complete discretion in deciding whether or not to approve an NDA and there is no guarantee that abaloparatide-SC will be approved for the treatment of women with postmenopausal osteoporosis or any other indication. We may never obtain regulatory approval for abaloparatide-SC, or any of our other product candidates. Failure to obtain FDA approval of abaloparatide-SC, or any of our other product candidates will severely undermine our business by leaving us without a saleable product, and therefore without any source of revenues, until another product candidate can be developed. There is no guarantee that we will ever be able to develop or acquire any other product candidate.\nIn foreign jurisdictions, we also must receive approval from the appropriate regulatory authorities before we can commercialize any drugs. In November 2015, we submitted an MAA to the EMA which was validated and is currently undergoing active regulatory assessment by the CHMP. Foreign regulatory approval processes generally include all of the risks associated with the FDA approval procedures described above. We cannot assure you that we will receive the approvals necessary to commercialize abaloparatide-SC, or any of our product candidates for sale outside the United States.\nAny collaboration arrangements that we may enter into in the future may not be successful, which could adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize abaloparatide-SC, or any of our other product candidates.\nOur product development programs and the potential commercialization of abaloparatide-SC or any of our product candidates will require substantial cash to fund expenses. For some of our product candidates, we may decide to collaborate with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for the development and potential commercialization of those product candidates. We will face, to the extent that we decide to enter into collaboration agreements, significant competition in seeking\nappropriate collaborators. Moreover, collaboration arrangements are complex and time consuming to negotiate, document and implement. We may not be successful in our efforts to establish and implement collaborations or other alternative arrangements should we so chose to enter into such arrangements.\nThe terms of any collaborations or other arrangements that we may establish may not be favorable to us. If that were to occur, we may have to curtail the development of a particular product candidate, reduce or delay its development program or one or more of our other development programs, delay its potential commercialization or reduce the scope of our sales or marketing activities, or increase our expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense. If we elect to increase our expenditures to fund development or commercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we do not have sufficient funds, we will not be able to bring our product candidates to market and generate product revenue.\nAny future collaborations that we enter into may not be successful. The success of our collaboration arrangements will depend heavily on the efforts and activities of our future collaborators. Collaborators generally have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaborations. If a collaborator fails to provide sufficient effort and resources to a development program, we may not realize the full potential or intended benefit of the collaboration, and the development program may be delayed or curtailed.\nClinical trials are very expensive, time-consuming and difficult to design and implement.\nHuman clinical trials are very expensive and difficult to design and implement, in part because they are subject to rigorous regulatory requirements. A substantial portion of our abaloparatide development costs is denominated in euros and any adverse movement in the dollar/euro exchange rate will result in increased costs and could require us to raise additional capital to complete the development of our products. The clinical trial process is also time consuming. Furthermore, failure can occur at any stage of the trials, and we could encounter problems that cause us to abandon or repeat clinical trials. The commencement and completion of clinical trials may be delayed by several factors, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in government regulation, administrative action or changes in FDA or foreign regulatory authority policy with respect to clinical trials that change the requirements for approval;\n\u2022\nunforeseen safety issues;\n\u2022\ndetermination of dosing issues;\n\u2022\nlack of effectiveness during clinical trials;\n\u2022\nslower than expected rates of patient recruitment and enrollment;\n\u2022\nfailure of sites to comply with requirements for conducting clinical trials;\n\u2022\ninability to monitor patients adequately during or after treatment; and\n\u2022\ninability or unwillingness of medical investigators to follow our clinical protocols.\nIn addition, we, the FDA, or other equivalent regulatory authorities and ethics committees with jurisdiction over our studies may suspend our clinical trials at any time if it appears that we are exposing participants to unacceptable health risks or if the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities find deficiencies in our regulatory submissions or the conduct of these trials. Therefore, we cannot predict with any certainty the schedule for existing or future clinical trials. Any such unexpected expenses or delays in our clinical trials could increase our need for additional capital, which may not be available on favorable terms or at all.\nMost of our investigational product candidates are in early stages of clinical trials.\nExcept for abaloparatide-SC and abaloparatide-TD, each of our other product candidates (i.e., RAD1901 and RAD140) is in the early stages of development and requires extensive preclinical and clinical testing. We cannot predict with any certainty if or when we might submit an NDA or equivalent application to foreign regulatory authorities for regulatory approval for any of these other product candidates or whether any such NDA or equivalent application would be accepted for filing by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities or approved if filed.\nThe results of clinical trials may not support our product candidate claims.\nEven if our clinical trials are completed as planned, we cannot be certain that the results will support regulatory approval of our product candidates. Success in preclinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful, and we cannot be sure that the results of later clinical trials will replicate the results of prior clinical trials and preclinical testing. The clinical trial process may fail to demonstrate that our product candidates are safe for humans and effective for proposed uses. This failure would cause us to abandon a product candidate and may delay development of other product candidates. Any delay in, or termination of, our clinical trials will delay the submission of our NDAs to the FDA or equivalent application to foreign regulatory authorities and, ultimately, our ability to commercialize our product candidates and generate product revenues. In addition, our clinical trials to date (other than the ACTIVE Phase 3 Clinical Trial for abaloparatide-SC) have involved small patient populations. Because of the small sample sizes, the results of these clinical trials may not be indicative of future results.\nIn addition, third parties could conduct clinical trials using the product candidates we license. We would have no control over how these trials are conducted and the results could potentially contradict the results we have obtained, or will obtain from the clinical trials we conduct.\nIf serious adverse or undesirable side effects are identified during the development of our product candidates, we may need to abandon our development of some of our product candidates.\nUndesirable side effects caused by our product candidates could cause us, regulatory authorities, and/or ethics committees to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in a more restrictive label or cause the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other comparable foreign authorities. It is impossible to predict when or if any of our product candidates will prove effective or safe in humans or will receive regulatory approval, if ever. If our product candidates result in undesirable side effects or have characteristics that are unexpected, we may need to abandon their development. Drug-related side effects could affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete the trial or result in potential product liability claims. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly.\nAdditionally, if one or more of our product candidates receives marketing approval, and we or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by such products, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may withdraw approvals of such product;\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may require additional warnings on the label;\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may require us to adopt a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS;\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may require us to conduct additional post-market studies, including clinical studies, to assess the safety of the product;\n\u2022\nwe may be required to create a medication guide outlining the risks of such side effects for distribution to patients;\n\u2022\nwe could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients; and\n\u2022\nour reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the particular product candidate, if approved, and could significantly harm our business, results of operations and prospects.\nAny product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we experience unanticipated problems with our products, when and if any of them are approved.\nAny product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval, along with the manufacturing processes, distribution processes, post-approval clinical data, labeling, advertising and promotional activities for such product, will be subject to continuing requirements of and review by the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration and listing requirements, cGMP requirements relating to quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, and requirements regarding the distribution of drug products, including drug samples to physicians and recordkeeping. Even if we obtain marketing approval of a product candidate, the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, or contain requirements for costly post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety and/or efficacy of the product. The FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs to ensure drugs\nare marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. The FDA imposes stringent restrictions on manufacturers' communications regarding off-label use and, if we market our products for other than their approved indications, we may be subject to enforcement action for off-label marketing.\nIn addition, later discovery of previously unknown problems with our products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may yield various results, including:\n\u2022\nrestrictions on such products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the labeling or marketing of a product;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on product distribution or use;\n\u2022\nrequirements to conduct post-marketing clinical trials;\n\u2022\nwarning or untitled letters;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of the products from the market;\n\u2022\nrefusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit;\n\u2022\nvoluntary or mandatory recall of products and related publicity requirements;\n\u2022\nfines, restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenue;\n\u2022\nsuspension or withdrawal of marketing approvals;\n\u2022\nrefusal to permit the import or export of our products;\n\u2022\nproduct seizure; or\n\u2022\ninjunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nIn addition, the FDA's policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit, or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature, or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability, which would adversely affect our business.\nThe commercial success of any product candidates that we may develop and that may be approved will depend upon the degree of market acceptance by regulators, key opinion leaders, physicians, patients, healthcare payors and others in the medical community.\nEven if the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities approves one or more of our product candidates, physicians and patients may not accept and use them. Acceptance and use of any of our products will depend upon a number of factors including:\n\u2022\nperceptions by members of the healthcare community, including physicians and key opinion leaders, about the safety and effectiveness of our drug;\n\u2022\nthe approved indicated uses for our product;\n\u2022\ncost-effectiveness of our product relative to competing products;\n\u2022\navailability of coverage and reimbursement for our product from government or other healthcare payors; and\n\u2022\neffectiveness of marketing and distribution efforts by us and our licensees and distributors, if any.\nIf abaloparatide-SC or any of our other investigational product candidates are commercialized and unexpected adverse events are reported in connection with the use of any of those products, physician and patient acceptance of the product could deteriorate and the commercial success of such product could be adversely affected. We are required to report to the FDA or\nsimilar bodies in other countries events associated with our products relating to death or serious injury. Adverse events could result in additional regulatory controls, such as for the imposition of costly post-approval clinical studies, imposition of a REMS, or revisions to approved labeling which could limit the indications or patient population for a product or could even lead to the withdrawal of a product from the market. Because we expect sales of our current product candidates, if approved, to generate substantially all of our product revenues for the foreseeable future, the failure of these drugs to gain market acceptance or, once gained, a decrease in market acceptance would harm our business and would require us to seek additional financing.\nOur ability to successfully commercialize products depends in part on the extent to which coverage and reimbursement for the costs of our products and related treatments will be available in the United States and worldwide from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations.\nOur ability to commercialize abaloparatide-SC or any of our product candidates if approved, alone or with collaborators, will depend in large part on the extent to which coverage and reimbursement will be available post-approval from:\n\u2022\ngovernment and health administration authorities;\n\u2022\nprivate health maintenance organizations and health insurers; and\n\u2022\nother healthcare payors.\nIn the United States and internationally, sales of products that we market in the future, and our ability to generate revenues on such sales, are dependent, in significant part, on the availability and level of coverage and reimbursement from third party payors such as state and federal governments, managed care providers and private insurance plans. Private insurers, such as health maintenance organizations and managed care providers, have implemented cost cutting and reimbursement initiatives and likely will continue to do so in the future. These include establishing formularies that govern the drugs and biologics that will be offered and also the out-of-pocket obligations of member patients for such products. In addition, particularly in the United States and increasingly in other countries, we may be required to provide discounts and pay rebates to state and federal governments and agencies in connection with purchases of our products that are reimbursed by such entities. It is possible that future legislation in the United States and other jurisdictions could be enacted which could potentially impact the reimbursement rates for the products we are developing and may develop in the future and also could further impact the levels of discounts and rebates paid to federal and state government entities. Any legislation that impacts these areas, including the ongoing consideration of the repeal and replacement of the ACA and other legislation focused on drug pricing, could impact, in a significant way, our ability to generate revenues from sales of products that, if successfully developed, we bring to market.\nDecisions in the European Union on pricing and reimbursement of medicinal products are based upon national rules subject to the control of the Transparency Directive, which aims to ensure the transparency measures established by EU countries to control the pricing and reimbursement of medicinal products. The Transparency Directive defines a series of procedural requirements designed to verify that national pricing and reimbursement decisions do not create obstacles to the pharmaceutical trade within the EU's Internal Market. The competent authorities of each of the 28 EU Member States have adopted individual policies and rules regulating the pricing and reimbursement of medicinal products in their territory. These strategies often vary widely in nature, scope and application. However, a major element that they have in common is an increased move toward reduction in the reimbursement price of medicinal products, a reduction in the number and type of products selected for reimbursement, and an increased preference for generic products over innovative products. These efforts have mostly been executed through these countries' existing price-control methodologies, including price cuts, mandatory rebates, value-based pricing, and reference pricing (i.e., referencing prices in other countries and using those reference prices to set a price). It is increasingly common in many EU Member States for Marketing Authorization Holders to be required, in order to get support for reimbursement under national health schemes and, therefore, practical access to the market to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness or added value benefit of their products as compared to products already subject to pricing and reimbursement in specific countries. In order for drugs to be evaluated positively under such criteria, pharmaceutical companies may need to re-examine, and consider altering, a number of traditional functions relating to the selection, study, and management of drugs, whether currently marketed, under development, or being evaluated as candidates for research and/or development.\nFuture legislation, including the current versions being considered at the federal and state level in the United States and at the national level in EU Member States, or regulatory actions implementing recent or future legislation may have a significant effect on our business. If government and other healthcare payors do not provide adequate coverage and reimbursement levels for our product candidates, once approved, market acceptance of our products could be reduced. In addition, negotiating prices with government authorities under current and proposed legislation can delay the commercialization of our product candidates.\nWe may expend our limited resources to pursue a particular product candidate or indication and fail to capitalize on product candidates or indications that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nBecause we have limited financial and managerial resources, we narrowly focus on research programs and product candidates that we identify for specific indications. As a result, we may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with other product candidates or for other indications that later prove to have greater commercial potential. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. Our spending on current and future research and development programs and product candidates for specific indications may not yield any commercially viable products. If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through collaboration, licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such product candidate.\nIf we experience delays in the enrollment of patients in our clinical trials, our receipt of necessary regulatory approvals could be delayed or prevented.\nWe may not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials for some of our product candidates if we are unable to locate and enroll a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in these trials as required by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities. In addition, many of our competitors have ongoing clinical trials for product candidates that could be competitive with our product candidates, and patients who would otherwise be eligible for our clinical trials may instead enroll in clinical trials of our competitors' product candidates.\nEnrollment delays in our clinical trials may result in increased development costs for our product candidates, which would cause the value of the company to decline and limit our ability to obtain additional financing. Our inability to enroll a sufficient number of patients for any of our current or future clinical trials would result in significant delays or may require us to abandon one or more clinical trials altogether.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties\nOur drug development programs depend upon third-party researchers, investigators and collaborators who are outside our control.\nWe depend upon independent researchers, investigators and collaborators, to conduct our preclinical studies and clinical trials under agreements with us. These third parties are not our employees and we cannot control the amount or timing of resources that they devote to our programs. Nevertheless, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our studies is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol, legal, regulatory and scientific standards and requirements, and our reliance on third parties does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. We and our third-party researchers, investigators and collaborators are required to comply with good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements, which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA, the Competent Authorities of the Member States of the European Economic Area, or EEA, and comparable foreign regulatory authorities for all of our products in clinical development. Regulatory authorities enforce these GCPs through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and trial sites. If we or any of our CROs fail to comply with applicable GCPs, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA, EMA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. We cannot assure you that upon inspection by a given regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that any of our clinical trials complies with GCP regulations. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with product produced under cGMP regulations. Our failure to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process. In addition, these third parties may not assign as great a priority to our programs or pursue them as diligently as we would if we were undertaking such programs ourselves. If outside collaborators fail to devote sufficient time and resources to our drug-development programs, or if their performance is substandard, the approval of our FDA or foreign regulatory authority applications, if any, and our introduction of new drugs, if any, will be delayed. These collaborators may also have relationships with other commercial entities, some of whom may compete with us. If our collaborators assist competitors at our expense, our competitive position would be harmed.\nIf a regulatory or governmental authority determines that a financial interest in the outcome of the Phase 3 study of abaloparatide-SC by any of the entities who managed our Phase 3 clinical trial affected the reliability of the data from the Phase 3 clinical trial, our ability to use the data for our planned regulatory submissions could be compromised, which could harm our business and the value of our common stock.\nThe Phase 3 clinical trial for abaloparatide-SC, which we refer to as the ACTIVE clinical trial, and subsequent extension studies, which we refer to as the ACTIVExtend clinical trials, have been managed by Nordic Bioscience Clinical Development VII A/S, or Nordic, at certain clinical sites operated by the Center for Clinical and Basic Research, or CCBR, a leading global CRO with extensive experience in global osteoporosis registration studies. Nordic controls, and holds an ownership interest in,\nthe local CCBR clinical sites. The clinical trial investigators are employees of CCBR and may also hold an equity interest in the local CCBR clinical trials.\nIn consideration of Nordic's management of our Phase 3 clinical trial and subsequent extension studies, we agreed to make various cash payments to Nordic denominated in both euros and U.S. dollars over the course of the Phase 3 ACTIVE and ACTIVExtend clinical trials, or the ACTIVE Clinical Trials, equal to a total of up to approximately \u20ac53.0 million ($57.5 million) and a total of up to approximately $4.4 million plus up to an additional $5.0 million in aggregate performance incentive payments, payable in cash. We also agreed to sell shares of capital stock to Nordic that were exchanged in May 2011 for 6,443 shares of our series A-5 convertible preferred stock for proceeds of approximately $0.5 million. These shares of our series A-5 convertible preferred stock automatically converted into 28,258 shares of our common stock upon the listing of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Market. Pursuant to the terms of our agreements with Nordic, we were required to issue to Nordic shares of stock with an aggregate value of up to approximately \u20ac44.3 million ($48.1 million) and $0.8 million in consideration of Nordic's management of the ACTIVE Clinical Trials. These shares of stock accrued at a quarterly rate based on the progress of the ACTIVE Clinical Trials and were issuable at a price per share equal to the greater of (1) the fair market value of our common stock as of the applicable accrual date or (2) $81.42 and rounding down the resulting quotient to the nearest whole number. On each of December 31, 2013 and March 31, 2014, our Board of Directors declared a stock dividend to pay all shares of stock that had accrued as of such dates and that were anticipated to accrue through December 31, 2014, representing an aggregate of 682,958 shares of our Series A-6 convertible preferred stock that automatically converted into 2,995,453 shares of our common stock upon the listing of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Market. Following the completion of our initial public offering of shares of our common stock on June 11, 2014, or our initial public offering, all compensation remaining payable to Nordic in consideration of their management of the ACTIVE Clinical Trials became payable in cash.\nThe fair market value of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control. Accordingly, the shares of stock that we have issued to Nordic in consideration of Nordic's management of the ACTIVE Clinical Trials may be less than the full value originally anticipated under our agreements with Nordic, assuming Nordic did not expect the fair market value of our stock to fluctuate widely over the term of such agreements. As a result, the total consideration that Nordic received in stock and will receive in cash may be viewed to be below the market price paid by other companies for comparable clinical trial services.\nBecause of the potential decrease in the value of the common stock issued to Nordic if there was a negative outcome of the ACTIVE Clinical Trials, Nordic, CCBR and the clinical trial investigators may be viewed as having a financial interest in the outcome of the study. We have obtained written acknowledgments from the clinical trial investigators certifying that they have no financial interest in the outcome of the ACTIVE Clinical Trials. However, if the FDA, the EMA, or any other similar regulatory or governmental authority determines that Nordic, CCBR or the clinical trial investigators have a financial interest that affected the reliability of the data from the ACTIVE Clinical Trials, we could be subject to additional regulatory scrutiny and the utility of the ACTIVE Clinical Trials for purposes of our planned regulatory submissions could be compromised, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and the value of our common stock.\nWe will rely exclusively on third parties to formulate and manufacture our product candidates.\nWe have no experience in drug formulation or manufacturing and do not intend to establish our own manufacturing facilities. We lack the resources and expertise to formulate or manufacture our own product candidates. We have entered into agreements with contract manufacturers to manufacture our product candidates for use in clinical trial activities. These contract manufacturers are currently our only source for the production and formulation of our product candidates. We may not have sufficient clinical supplies of our product candidates but believe that our contract manufacturers will be able to produce sufficient supply of our product candidates to complete all of the planned clinical studies. If our contract manufacturers are unable to produce, in a timely manner, adequate clinical supplies to meet the needs of our clinical studies, we would be required to seek new contract manufacturers that may require us to modify our finished product formulation and modify or terminate our clinical studies. Any modification of our finished product or modification or termination of our clinical studies could adversely affect our ability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals and significantly delay or prevent the commercial launch of the product if it were to be approved, which would materially harm our business and impair our ability to raise capital. In addition, the facilities and processes and controls used by our contract manufacturers to manufacture our product candidates must be approved by the EMA, and by the FDA pursuant to inspections that will be conducted following our regulatory approval submissions. We do not control the facilities or manufacturing process, and are completely dependent on, our contract manufacturing partners for compliance with cGMPs for manufacture of both active drug substances and finished drug products. If our contract manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA or other regulatory authorities, they will not be able to secure and/or maintain regulatory approval for their manufacturing facilities. In addition, we have no control over the ability of our contract manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel. If the FDA or a comparable\nforeign regulatory authority does not approve our contract manufacturers for the manufacture of our product candidates or if they withdraw any such approval in the future, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which would significantly impact our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for or market our product candidates, if approved.\nWe depend on a number of single source contract manufacturers to supply key components of abaloparatide. For example, we depend on PPL, which has agreed to produce supplies of abaloparatide API to support the abaloparatide-SC and abaloparatide-TD clinical studies and any potential commercial launch. We also depend on Vetter and Ypsomed for the production of finished drug product clinical and commercial supplies of abaloparatide-SC and we depend on 3M for the production of abaloparatide-TD. If our relationship with any of these contract manufacturers is terminated, or if they are unable to produce abaloparatide or related components in required quantities, on a timely basis or at all, and/or in compliance with the terms of our agreements, our business and financial condition would be materially harmed. Because the manufacturing process for abaloparatide-TD requires the use of 3M's proprietary technology, 3M is our sole source for finished clinical trial supplies of abaloparatide-TD. To date, we have not entered into a commercial supply agreement with 3M. If we are not able to negotiate commercial supply terms with 3M, as we depend on 3M for production of abaloparatide-TD, we would be unable to commercialize this product if it were to be approved. Or, if we are forced to accept unfavorable terms for our future relationship with 3M, our business and financial condition would be materially harmed. If abaloparatide-SC or any of our other current product candidates or any product candidates we may develop or acquire in the future receive FDA or foreign regulatory authority approval, we will rely on one or more third-party contractors to manufacture our drugs or related components. Our anticipated future reliance on a limited number of third-party manufacturers exposes us to the following risks:\n\u2022\nWe may be unable to identify manufacturers on acceptable terms, or at all, because the number of potential manufacturers is limited and the FDA must approve any replacement contractor. This approval would require new testing and compliance inspections. In addition, a new manufacturer would have to be educated in, or develop substantially equivalent processes for, production of our products after receipt of FDA approval, if any.\n\u2022\nOur third-party manufacturers might be unable to formulate and manufacture our drugs or related components in the volume and of the quality required to meet our clinical needs and commercial needs, if any.\n\u2022\nOur contract manufacturers may not perform as agreed or may not remain in the contract manufacturing business for the time required to supply our clinical trials or to successfully produce, store and distribute our products.\n\u2022\nDrug manufacturers are subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspection by the FDA and corresponding state agencies to ensure strict compliance with cGMP, and other government regulations and corresponding foreign standards, and failure to comply with cGMP or corresponding foreign standards can result in compliance actions that may limit a manufacturer's production or prohibit a manufacturer from producing some or all products at a facility and/or importing it into the United States or a foreign country. We do not have control over third-party manufacturers' compliance with these regulations and standards.\n\u2022\nIf any third-party manufacturer makes improvements in the manufacturing process for our products, any such improvement(s) could be subject to FDA review and prior approval, and we may not own, or may have to share, the intellectual property rights to the innovation.\nEach of these risks could delay our clinical trials, the approval, if any, of our product candidates by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities or the commercialization of our product candidates or result in higher costs or deprive us of potential product revenues.\nIf we fail to establish an effective distribution process utilizing cold chain logistics for abaloparatide-SC, our business may be adversely affected.\nWe do not currently have the infrastructure necessary for distributing pharmaceutical products to patients. We will be contracting with a third-party logistics company to warehouse abaloparatide-SC and distribute it to specialty pharmacies and wholesale distributors who will supply abaloparatide-SC to the market. We will require that abaloparatide-SC be maintained at a controlled refrigerated temperature throughout the distribution chain. This distribution chain will require significant coordination among our manufacturing, supply-chain and finance teams, as well as commercial departments, including market access, sales, and marketing. In addition, failure to secure contracts with appropriate pharmacy providers and/or wholesale distributors could negatively impact the distribution of abaloparatide-SC, and failure to coordinate financial systems could negatively impact our ability to accurately report product revenue. If we are unable to effectively establish and manage the distribution process, the commercial launch and sales of abaloparatide-SC will be delayed or severely compromised and our results of operations may be harmed.\nRisks Related to Marketing and Sale of Our Products\nWe currently have limited commercial and medical affairs capabilities and have no experience selling, marketing or distributing products. If we are unable to build these capabilities on our own or through partnerships or collaborations, we may not be able to successfully commercialize abaloparatide-SC, if approved, or any future product candidates or generate product revenue.\nWe currently are building our commercial and medical affairs capabilities and we have no experience commercializing a pharmaceutical product. We intend to build an internal sales force to market and sell our products to specialists within the target indications, if approved, and also to pursue collaborative arrangements to market and sell our products more broadly within the target indications if approved. Therefore, our future success depends, in part, on our ability to enter into and maintain collaborative relationships for such capabilities, the collaborators' strategic interest in the products under development and such collaborators' ability to successfully market and sell any such products.\nIn addition, our ability to build effective commercial, medical affairs, marketing, sales, market access, managerial and other non-technical capabilities will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to:\n\u2022\nidentify, recruit, hire, train, incentivize and retain a significant number of commercial and medical affairs personnel, including a specialty sales force with appropriate technical expertise;\n\u2022\ntrain our sales representatives, who will have no prior experience with our company or abaloparatide-SC, to deliver clear and compelling messages within the scope of the approved labeling and in accordance with other applicable FDA requirements regarding abaloparatide-SC and to be credible and persuasive in educating physicians on the appropriate situations to consider prescribing it as set forth in the approved labeling;\n\u2022\nensure our commercial customer-facing team, including sales, market access, and field logistics professionals, effectively build relationships with their respective customers;\n\u2022\nmanage a geographically dispersed national commercial customer-facing organization; and\n\u2022\nmanage our significant projected growth and the integration of new personnel.\nBuilding our commercial and medical affairs capabilities may be more expensive and time consuming than we anticipate, requiring us to divert resources from other intended purposes or preventing us from building these capabilities to the desired levels. Any failure or delay in building these capabilities on our own or through partnerships or collaborations will adversely impact the successful commercialization of abaloparatide-SC, or any future product candidate. If we establish a partnership or collaboration for purposes of commercializing abaloparatide-SC, or any future product candidate, the launch of that product candidate would need to be established in conjunction with our partner, which could result in a change in timing of the commercial launch.\nIn addition, given our existing resources and lack of prior experience in marketing, selling and distributing pharmaceutical products, our initial specialty sales force may be materially smaller than the actual number of sales representatives required to successfully commercialize abaloparatide-SC. As such, we may be required to hire substantially more sales representatives to adequately support the commercialization of abaloparatide-SC.\nIf we cannot compete successfully for market share against other drug companies, we may not achieve sufficient product revenues and our business will suffer.\nThe market for our product candidates is characterized by intense competition and rapid technological advances. If abaloparatide-SC or any of our product candidates receives FDA or foreign regulatory authority approval, it will compete with a number of existing and future drugs and therapies developed, manufactured and marketed by others. Existing or future competing products may provide greater therapeutic convenience or clinical or other benefits for a specific indication than our products, or may offer comparable performance at a lower cost. If our products fail to capture and maintain market share, we may not achieve sufficient product revenues and our business will suffer.\nWe are seeking regulatory approval of abaloparatide-SC for the treatment of women with postmenopausal osteoporosis. In March 2016, we submitted an NDA for the FDA for abaloparatide-SC, which has been accepted for filing by the FDA with a PDUFA date of March 30, 2017. We expect to compete against well-known treatment options, including teriparatide, marketed by Lilly as Forteo/Forsteo. We may also face competition from generic or biosimilar versions teriparatide. For example, a biosimilar version of teriparatide was recently approved in the European Union, although the product is not expected to be launched until the expiration or invalidation of applicable patents covering teriparatide. We are also aware of other companies pursuing development of biosimilar and/or generic versions of teriparatide in the U.S. and EU through various regulatory pathways. The availability of a generic or biosimilar teriparatide on the market would likely exert pricing pressure on the\nanabolic class in which abaloparatide-SC would compete. In addition, there are other organizations working to develop new therapies to treat osteoporosis. For example, UCB and Amgen are co-developing an anti-sclerostin anabolic monoclonal antibody for the treatment of osteoporosis, which is currently under review by the FDA with a PDUFA date of July 19, 2017. In order to compete successfully in this market, we will have to demonstrate to physicians and payors that the treatment of osteoporosis with abaloparatide-SC is worthwhile and is a better alternative to existing or new therapies.\nWe face significant competition from many fully integrated pharmaceutical companies and smaller companies that are collaborating with larger pharmaceutical companies, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations. Many of these competitors have compounds already approved or in development. In addition, many of these competitors, either alone or together with their collaborative partners, operate larger research and development programs or have substantially greater financial resources than we do, as well as significantly greater experience in:\n\u2022\ndeveloping drugs;\n\u2022\nundertaking preclinical testing and human clinical trials;\n\u2022\nobtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of drugs;\n\u2022\nformulating and manufacturing drugs; and\n\u2022\nlaunching, marketing and selling drugs.\nDevelopments by competitors may render our products or technologies obsolete or non-competitive.\nThe biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. Some of the drugs that we are attempting to develop, such as our investigational product candidates abaloparatide-SC, abaloparatide-TD, RAD1901 and RAD140, will have to compete against existing therapies if they are approved. In addition, a large number of companies are pursuing the development of pharmaceuticals that target the same diseases and conditions that we are targeting. We face competition from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in the United States and abroad. In addition, companies doing business in different but related fields represent substantial competition. Many of these organizations competing with us have substantially greater capital resources, larger research and development staffs and facilities, longer drug development history in obtaining regulatory approvals, and greater manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we do. These organizations also compete with us to attract qualified personnel and parties for acquisitions, joint ventures or other collaborations, and therefore, we may not be able to hire or retain qualified personnel to run all facets of our business. These risks could render our products or technologies obsolete or non-competitive.\nWe may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of our products in response to product liability lawsuits.\nThe testing and marketing of medical products entail an inherent risk of product liability. Even if one of our investigational product candidates is approved by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, if we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization of our products. Our inability to obtain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable cost to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of pharmaceutical products we develop, alone or with collaborators.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations in our intellectual property licenses with third parties, we could lose license rights that are important to our business.\nWe are a party to a number of intellectual property license agreements with third parties and expect to enter into additional license agreements in the future. Our existing license agreements impose, and we expect that any future license agreements will impose, various diligence, milestone payment, royalty, insurance and other obligations on us. If we fail to comply with these obligations, our licensors may have the right to terminate these agreements, in which event we might not be able to develop and market any product that is covered by these agreements. Termination of these licenses or reduction or elimination of our licensed rights may result in our having to negotiate new or reinstated licenses with less favorable terms. The occurrence of such events could materially harm our business.\nIn November 2016, we received notice that in October 2016, Ipsen initiated arbitration proceedings against us in the International Chamber of Commerce\u2019s International Court of Arbitration. Ipsen\u2019s Request for Arbitration alleges that we breached various provisions of the License Agreement concerning abaloparatide, including with regard to Ipsen's right to co-\npromote abaloparatide in France and a license from us with respect to Japan. Ipsen seeks declaratory relief, compliance with the License Agreement, damages, costs and fees as a result of the purported breaches, and alleges the monetary value of these claims is approximately \u20ac50 million. In January 2017, we submitted an Answer denying Ipsen\u2019s claims and alleging counterclaims against Ipsen for breach of the License Agreement and other declaratory judgment. We asserted, among other things, that Ipsen's claimed rights to co-promote abaloparatide in France and to a license from us with respect to Japan have permanently expired, and that Ipsen has breached the License Agreement by, among other things, allowing certain patents to expire and by purporting to license to a third party certain manufacturing and other rights that we contend Ipsen exclusively licensed to us. In February 2017, Ipsen submitted a Reply denying our counterclaims and alleging that we are precluded from asserting them. We are seeking dismissal of Ipsen\u2019s claims, as well as declaratory relief, compliance with the License Agreement, and other damages, costs and fees to be determined by the Arbitral Tribunal. Given that this matter is at a preliminary stage, we cannot predict or assess the likely outcome of these proceedings.\nIf our efforts to protect our intellectual property related to abaloparatide-SC, abaloparatide-TD, RAD1901 and/or RAD140 fail to adequately protect these assets or if we are unable to secure all necessary intellectual property, we may lose the ability to license or successfully commercialize one or more of these candidates.\nOur commercial success is significantly dependent on intellectual property related to our portfolio of product candidates. We are either the licensee or assignee of numerous issued and pending patent applications that cover various aspects of our assets, including abaloparatide-SC, abaloparatide-TD, RAD1901 and RAD140.\nPatents covering abaloparatide as a composition of matter have been issued in the United States (U.S. Patent No. 5,969,095) and several additional countries. Because the abaloparatide composition of matter patent was filed in 1996, it expired in 2016 in the United States, and additional countries where it had issued. Prior to its expiration, European Patent No. 0847278, which was included in the license from Ipsen and claimed the composition of matter of abaloparatide, lapsed due to Ipsen's failure to pay annuities. Prior to expiration, we pursued restoration of those patent rights in various countries. As a result of the lapse and expiration of patent rights, we believe that some of Ipsen's rights under our license agreement with Ipsen have terminated. We are currently involved in a pending arbitration proceeding with Ipsen regarding these Ipsen rights and related terms of our license agreement.\nWe and Ipsen are also co-assignees to U.S. Patent No. 7,803,770 that we believe provides exclusivity until October 3, 2027 and may be extended to March 26, 2028 in the United States (not including any Hatch-Waxman patent term extension) for the method of treating osteoporosis with the intended therapeutic dose for abaloparatide-SC. We have received an intent to grant notice for a closely-related case in the EPO. This patent will also have an expiration date of October 3, 2027, absent any issued SPCs.\nWe and Ipsen are also co-assignees to U.S. Patent No. 8,148,333 that we believe provides exclusivity until 2027 in the United States (not including any Hatch-Waxman patent term extension) for the intended therapeutic formulation for abaloparatide-SC.\nWe and 3M are co-assignees to several foreign and corresponding U.S. patent applications with the earliest priority date of April 22, 2011, which cover various aspects of abaloparatide for microneedle application. Any issued patents resulting from these applications will expire in 2032. However, pending patent applications in the United States and elsewhere may not issue since the interpretation of the legal requirements of patentability in view of claimed inventions are not always predictable. Additional intellectual property covering abaloparatide-TD technology exists in the form of proprietary information protected as trade secrets. These can be accidentally disclosed to, independently derived by or misappropriated by competitors, possibly reducing or eliminating the exclusivity advantages of this form of intellectual property, thereby allowing those competitors more rapid entry into the marketplace with a competitive product, which reduces our advantage with abaloparatide-TD. In addition, trade secrets may in some instances become publicly available through required disclosures in regulatory files. Alternatively, competitors may sometimes reverse engineer a product once it becomes available on the market. Even where a competitor does not use an identical technology for the delivery of abaloparatide, it is possible that they could achieve an equivalent or even superior result using another technology. Such occurrences could lead to either one or more alternative competitor products becoming available on the market and/or one or more generic competitor products on the market gaining market share and causing a corresponding decrease in market share and/or price for abaloparatide-TD even if it were to be successfully developed and approved by the FDA.\nPatents covering RAD1901 as a composition of matter, as well as the use of RAD1901 for the treatment of estrogen-dependent breast cancer, have been issued in the United States, Canada, Australia, Japan and Europe, and are pending in India. The RAD1901 composition of matter patents in the United States expire in 2023 and may be extended to 2026 (not including any Hatch-Waxman patent term extension). One patent has been issued in the United States (U.S. Patent No. 8,933,130) for treating vasomotor disturbances or hot flashes on January 13, 2015 (statutory term expires on June 22, 2027, and may be extended to October 19, 2031 with 1,580 days of patent term adjustment due to delays in patent prosecution by the USPTO).\nAnother patent application relating to methods of treating vasomotor symptoms and clinical dosage strengths using RAD1901 has been allowed in the United States. When issued, this patent will have a normal expiry of May 12, 2031, not including any Hatch-Waxman patent term extension. Additional patent applications relating to methods of treating vasomotor symptoms and clinical dosage strengths using RAD1901 have been issued in Canada, Europe, and Mexico, and are pending in Canada and Europe. Pending patent applications in the United States and elsewhere may not issue since the interpretation of the legal requirements of patentability in view of any claimed invention before a patent office are not always predictable. As a result, we could encounter challenges or difficulties in building, maintaining and/or defending our intellectual property both in the United States and abroad.\nPatent applications covering RAD140 and other selective androgen receptor modulator compounds have been granted in the United States, Europe, Canada, Mexico, Japan and Australia, and are pending in Brazil and India. The RAD140 composition of matter patents expire in 2029 in the United States (not including any Hatch-Waxman patent term extension) and additional countries if and when they issue.\nSince patents are technical legal documents that are frequently subject to intense litigation pressure, there is risk that even if one or more patents related to our products does issue and is asserted that the patent(s) will be found invalid, unenforceable and/or not infringed when subject to said litigation. Finally, the intellectual property laws and practices can vary considerably from one country to another and also can change with time. As a result, we could encounter challenges or difficulties in building, maintaining and defending our intellectual property both in the United States and abroad.\nWe may become party to, or threatened with, future adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding intellectual property rights with respect to patents issued or licensed to us, including interference proceedings before the USPTO. Third parties also may assert infringement claims against us. If we are found to infringe a third party's intellectual property rights, we could be required to obtain a license from such third party to continue developing and marketing our products and technology. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. We could be forced, including by court order, to cease commercializing the infringing technology or product. In addition, we could be found liable for monetary damages. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing our product candidates or force us to cease some of our business operations, which could materially harm our business. Claims that we have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties could have a similar negative impact on our business. For example, we are aware of a patent issued in the United States claiming the use of RAD1901 for an indication we are not pursuing and a patent application filed with the USPTO that could be relevant to the use of RAD1901 to treat indications for which we are developing RAD1901. If a patent issues from this patent application with claims covering the use of RAD1901 to treat indications for which we are developing RAD1901, we may need to license the patent in order to commercialize RAD1901 specifically for the treatment of such indications even if RAD1901 were successfully developed and approved. We cannot assure you that we will be able to secure a license on reasonable terms, if at all. If we need a license of such patent in order to commercialize RAD1901 and are unable to secure one on reasonable terms, our business would be materially harmed.\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for our technology and products, or if our licensors are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for the technology or products that we license from them, our competitors could develop and commercialize technology and products similar or identical to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our technology and products may be adversely affected.\nOur success depends in large part on our and our licensors' ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in the United States and other countries with respect to our proprietary technology and products. In some circumstances, we may not have the right to control the preparation, filing and prosecution of patent applications, or to maintain the patents, covering technology or products that we license from third parties. Therefore, we cannot be certain that these patents and applications will be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business. In addition, if third parties who license patents to us fail to maintain these patents, or lose rights to those patents, the rights we have licensed may be reduced or eliminated.\nThe patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has in recent years been the subject of much litigation. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our and our licensors' patent rights are highly uncertain. Our and our licensors' pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued that protect our technology or products or that effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection. The laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Assuming the other requirements for patentability are met, in the United States, prior to March 16, 2013, the first to make the claimed invention was entitled to the patent, or a \"first-to-invent\" system, while outside the United States, the first to file a patent application is entitled to the patent, or a \"first-to-file\" system. With the implementation of the Leahy-Smith America\nInvents Act, the United States now has a first-to-file system for patent applications filed on or after March 16, 2013. We may become involved in opposition, interference or derivation proceedings challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all. Therefore, we cannot be certain that we or our licensors were the first to make the inventions claimed in our owned and licensed patents or pending patent applications, or that we or our licensors were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. An adverse determination in any such proceeding could reduce the scope of, or invalidate our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our technology or products and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize products without infringing third-party patent rights.\nEven if our owned and licensed patent applications issue as patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection, prevent competitors from competing with us or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. Our competitors may be able to circumvent our owned or licensed patents by developing similar or alternative technologies or products in a non-infringing manner. The issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its scope, validity or enforceability, and our owned and licensed patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. Any challenges may result in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, which could limit our ability to stop or prevent us from stopping others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and products. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are approved or commercialized. As a result, our owned and licensed patents may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours.\nPayments, fees, submissions and various additional requirements must be met in order for pending patent applications to advance in prosecution and issued patents to be maintained. Rigorous compliance with these requirements is essential to procurement and maintenance of patents integral to our product portfolio.\nPeriodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and various other governmental fees on patents and/or patent applications will come due for payment periodically throughout the lifecycle of patent applications and issued patents. In order to help ensure that we comply with any required fee payment, documentary and/or procedural requirements as they might relate to any patents for which we are an assignee or co-assignee, we employ competent legal help and related professionals as needed to comply with those requirements. Our outside patent counsel uses Computer Packages, Inc. for patent annuity payments. We depend on Eisai to comply with any required fee payment, documentary and/or procedural requirements as they might relate to any patents we have licensed from them. Failure to meet a required fee payment, document production or procedural requirement can result in the abandonment of a pending patent application or the lapse of an issued patent. In some instances, the defect can be cured through late compliance but there are situations where the failure to meet the required event cannot be cured. Any failures could compromise the intellectual property protection around our preclinical or clinical candidates and possibly weaken or eliminate our ability to protect our eventual market share for that product.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed.\nIn addition to our patented technology and products, we rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information, to maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect these trade secrets, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties that have access to our trade secrets, such as our corporate collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties. We also enter into confidentiality and invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and consultants. However, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for any breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to, or independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position would be harmed.\nIf we infringe the rights of third parties, we could be prevented from selling products and could be forced to pay damages and defend against litigation.\nIf our products, methods, processes and other technologies infringe the proprietary rights of other parties, we could incur substantial costs and may have to:\n\u2022\nobtain licenses, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all;\n\u2022\nabandon an infringing drug candidate;\n\u2022\nredesign our products or processes to avoid infringement;\n\u2022\nstop using the subject matter claimed in the patents held by others;\n\u2022\npay damages; or\n\u2022\ndefend litigation or administrative proceedings which may be costly whether we win or lose, which could result in a substantial diversion of our financial and management resources.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time consuming. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours is invalid and/or unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation proceeding could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated and/or interpreted narrowly. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. In addition, our licensors may have rights to file and prosecute these types of claims, and we may be reliant on them to do so.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers.\nSome of our employees were previously employed at universities or other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although we try to ensure that our employees do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or these employees have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such employee's former employer. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nIntellectual property litigation could cause us to spend substantial resources and distract our personnel from their normal responsibilities.\nEven if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses, and could distract our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities, delaying the development of our product candidates. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments, and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Litigation or other proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce our resources available for development activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to adequately conduct any litigation or proceedings. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of any litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their substantially greater financial resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace.\nRisks Related to Legislation and Administrative Actions\nHealthcare reform may have a material adverse effect on our industry and our results of operations.\nFrom time to time, legislation is implemented to reign in rising healthcare expenditures. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or ACA, was enacted. ACA includes a number of provisions affecting the pharmaceutical industry, including annual, non-deductible fees on any entity that manufactures or imports some types of branded prescription drugs and biologics and increases in Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. In addition, among other things, ACA also establishes a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research. In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since ACA was enacted, which also may impact our business. On August 2, 2011, the President signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, or BCA, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend proposals in spending reductions to Congress. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve its targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013\nthrough 2021, triggering the legislation's automatic reduction to several government programs. These reductions include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will remain in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, or ATRA, was enacted, which among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers. The full impact on our business of these laws is uncertain. We cannot predict whether other legislative changes will be adopted, if any, or how such changes would affect the pharmaceutical industry generally or our business in particular.\nWe expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product candidates once approved or additional pricing pressures, and may adversely affect our operating results. Such legislation may also reduce our flexibility in setting prices for our product candidates, or in taking price increases.\nWe are subject to healthcare laws, regulation and enforcement, and our failure to comply with those laws could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial conditions.\nWe are subject to several healthcare regulations and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include:\n\u2022\nthe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, which governs the conduct of various electronic healthcare transactions and protects the security and privacy of protected health information;\n\u2022\nthe federal healthcare programs' Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation; in addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act;\n\u2022\nfederal false claims laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payers that are false or fraudulent;\n\u2022\nfederal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation;\n\u2022\nthe federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, or the Sunshine Act, requires applicable manufacturers of covered drugs to report payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Manufacturers are required to submit reports to the government by the 90th day of each calendar year; and\n\u2022\nstate law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the industry's voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nOur operations and future commercial activities in connection with any product candidate that is approved will be subject to comprehensive compliance obligations under state and federal fraud and abuse, false claims, physician payment transparency laws and government pricing regulations, as described above. If we are found to be in violation of these regulations, we may be\nsubject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.\nWe may be exposed to liability claims associated with the use of hazardous materials and chemicals.\nOur research and development activities may involve the controlled use of hazardous materials and chemicals. Although we believe that our safety procedures for using, storing, handling and disposing of these materials comply with federal, state and local laws and regulations, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental injury or contamination from these materials. In the event of such an accident, we could be held liable for any resulting damages and any liability could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous or radioactive materials and waste products may require us to incur substantial compliance costs that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe potential U.K. exit from the European Union as a result of the recent U.K. referendum could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOn June 23, 2016, the U.K. affirmatively voted in a non-binding referendum advising for the exit of the U.K. from the European Union, commonly referred to as the \u201cBrexit\u201d. The referendum is non-binding; however, if passed into law, negotiations would commence to determine the future terms of the U.K.\u2019s relationship with the European Union, including the terms of trade between the U.K. and the European Union. The effects of Brexit will depend on any agreements the U.K. makes to retain access to European Union markets either during a transitional period or more permanently. Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the U.K. determines which European Union laws to replace or replicate.\nThe announcement of Brexit caused significant volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations that resulted in the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies in which we conduct business. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies may adversely affect our operating results. The announcement of Brexit and the withdrawal of the U.K. from the European Union have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets, and may significantly reduce global market liquidity. Any of these effects of Brexit, among others, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nAny delay to the PDUFA date for our abaloparatide-SC NDA could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWhile PDUFA dates are based on goals to which FDA agreed under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, such dates are not binding on the agency. Any delay in the PDUFA date could, in addition to the delay of any potential sales revenue, cause us to incur financial loses, including related to the costs of hiring and maintaining a sales force for the anticipated commercial launch of abaloparatide-SC following a potential March 30, 2017 approval date. Depending on the length of any such potential delay, these financial losses could be significant.\nRisks Related to Employee Matters and Managing Growth\nWe have recently increased the size of our organization, and will need to continue to increase the size of our organization. We may encounter difficulties with managing our growth, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we employed approximately 240 employees. Although we have already added several capabilities, we will need to add additional qualified personnel and resources if the NDA for abaloparatide-SC is approved for marketing and we establish a commercial sales force. Our current infrastructure will be inadequate to support these future efforts and expected growth. In particular, we will have to develop internal sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities if we decide to market any drug that we may successfully develop, including abaloparatide-SC. Future growth will impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including the need to identify, recruit, maintain and integrate additional employees, and may take time away from running other aspects of our business, including development and commercialization of our product candidates.\nOur future financial performance and our ability to commercialize our product candidates and to compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to manage any future growth effectively. In particular, as our commercialization plans and strategies develop, we will need to recruit and train a substantial number of sales and marketing personnel and expect to need to expand the size of our employee base for managerial, operational, financial and other resources. To that end, we must be able to:\n\u2022manage our development efforts effectively\u037e\n\u2022integrate additional management, administrative and manufacturing personnel\u037e\n\u2022build a marketing and sales organization\u037e and\n\u2022maintain sufficient administrative, accounting and management information systems and controls.\nWe may not be able to accomplish these tasks or successfully manage our operations and, accordingly, may not achieve our research, development, and commercialization goals. Our failure to accomplish any of these goals could harm our financial results and prospects.\nAs we evolve from a company primarily involved in drug discovery and development into one that is also involved in the commercialization of pharmaceutical products, we may have difficulty managing our growth and expanding our operations successfully.\nOur success will depend upon the expansion of our operations and the effective management of our growth, and if we are unable to manage this growth effectively, our business will be harmed. We are expanding, and will continue to expand, our development, regulatory, manufacturing, quality, distribution, sales and marketing capabilities. As part of this expansion, we expect we will need to manage additional relationships with various collaborators, suppliers and other organizations. Our ability to manage our operations and growth requires us to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures. For example, some jurisdictions, such as the District of Columbia, have imposed licensing requirements for sales representatives. In addition, the District of Columbia and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, as well as the federal government by way of the Sunshine Act, have established reporting requirements that would require public reporting of compensation and other \"transfers of value\" paid to health care professionals and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by such professionals and their immediate family members. Because the reporting requirements vary in each jurisdiction, compliance will be complex and expensive and may create barriers to entering the commercialization phase. The need to build new systems as part of our growth could place a strain on our administrative and operational infrastructure. We may not be able to make improvements to our management information and control systems in an efficient or timely manner and may discover deficiencies in existing systems and controls. Such requirements may also impact our opportunities to collaborate with physicians at academic research centers as new restrictions on academic-industry relationships are put in place. In the past, collaborations between academia and industry have led to important new innovations, but the new laws may have an effect on these activities. While we cannot predict whether any legislative or regulatory changes will have negative or positive effects, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and potential profitability.\nWe may enter into or seek to enter into business combinations and acquisitions which may be difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, divert management attention or dilute stockholder value.\nWe may enter into business combinations and acquisitions. We have limited experience in making acquisitions, which are typically accompanied by a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\nthe difficulty of integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired companies;\n\u2022\nthe potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management;\n\u2022\nthe potential for unknown liabilities and expenses;\n\u2022\nthe failure to achieve the expected benefits of the combination or acquisition;\n\u2022\nthe maintenance of acceptable standards, controls, procedures and policies; and\n\u2022\nthe impairment of relationships with employees as a result of any integration of new management and other personnel.\nIf we are not successful in completing acquisitions that we may pursue in the future, we would be required to reevaluate our business strategy and we may have incurred substantial expenses and devoted significant management time and resources in seeking to complete the acquisitions. In addition, we could use substantial portions of our available cash as all or a portion of the purchase price, or we could issue additional securities as consideration for these acquisitions, which could cause our stockholders to suffer significant dilution.\nWe rely on key executive officers and scientific and medical advisors, and their knowledge of our business and technical expertise would be difficult to replace.\nWe are highly dependent on our chief executive officer and our principal scientific, regulatory and medical advisors. We do not have \"key person\" life insurance policies for any of our officers. The loss of the technical knowledge and management and industry expertise of any of our key personnel could result in delays in product development, loss of customers and sales and diversion of management resources, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nIf we are unable to hire additional qualified personnel, our ability to grow our business may be harmed.\nWe will need to hire additional qualified personnel with expertise in preclinical testing, clinical research and testing, government regulation, formulation and manufacturing and sales and marketing. We compete for qualified individuals with numerous biopharmaceutical companies, universities and other research institutions. Competition for such individuals is intense, and we cannot be certain that our search for such personnel will be successful. Attracting and retaining qualified personnel will be critical to our success.\nSignificant disruptions of information technology systems or breaches of data security could adversely affect our business.\nOur business is increasingly dependent on critical, complex and interdependent information technology systems to support business processes as well as internal and external communications. Our computer systems are vulnerable to breakdown, malicious intrusion and computer viruses. Any failure to protect against breakdowns, malicious intrusions and computer viruses may result in the impairment of production and key business processes. In addition, our systems are potentially vulnerable to data security breaches, whether by employees or others, which may expose sensitive data to unauthorized persons. Such data security breaches could lead to the loss of trade secrets or other intellectual property, or could lead to the public exposure of personal information of our employees, clinical trial patients, customers, and others. Such disruptions and breaches of security could expose us to liability and have a material adverse effect on the operating results and financial condition of our business.\nRisks Relating to Our Securities\nOur stock price may be volatile, and the value of an investment in our common stock may decline.\nThe trading price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nactions or delays by the FDA, EMA or other foreign regulatory authority in respect of our NDA, MAA or other application for abaloparatide-SC;\n\u2022\nresults of clinical trials of our product candidates or those of our competitors;\n\u2022\nour operating performance and the operating performance of similar companies;\n\u2022\nthe success of competitive products;\n\u2022\nthe overall performance of the equity markets;\n\u2022\nthe number of shares of our common stock publicly owned and available for trading;\n\u2022\nthreatened or actual litigation;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws or regulations relating to our products, including changes in the structure of healthcare payment systems;\n\u2022\nany major change in our board of directors or management;\n\u2022\npublication of research reports about us or our industry or positive or negative recommendations or withdrawal of research coverage by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nlarge volumes of sales of our shares of common stock by existing stockholders;\n\u2022\ngeneral political, economic and market conditions; and\n\u2022\nthe other factors described in this \"Risk Factors\" section.\nIn addition, the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the companies whose shares trade in the stock market. Securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the market price of a company's securities. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in very substantial costs, divert our management's attention and resources and harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nBecause we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, will be your sole source of gain.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain all of our future earnings, if any, to finance the growth and development of our business. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\nWe have incurred and will continue to incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management is required to devote substantial time to compliance initiatives.\nAs a public company listed on the NASDAQ Global Market, or NASDAQ, we have incurred and will continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and rules subsequently implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, and NASDAQ have imposed various requirements on public companies, including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations have increased our legal and financial compliance costs and are making some activities more time-consuming and costly.\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Section 404, we are required to furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting, and are required to include an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting issued by our independent registered public accounting firm. If we are unable to maintain effective internal controls, we may not have adequate, accurate or timely financial information, and we may be unable to meet our reporting obligations as a publicly traded company or comply with the requirements of the SEC or Section 404. This could result in a restatement of our consolidated financial statements, the imposition of sanctions, including the inability of registered broker dealers to make a market in our common shares, or investigation by regulatory authorities. Any such action or other negative results caused by our inability to meet our reporting requirements or comply with legal and regulatory requirements or by disclosure of an accounting, reporting or control issue could adversely affect the trading price of our securities and our business. Material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting could also reduce our ability to obtain financing or could increase the cost of any financing we obtain.\nOur directors and executive officers, together with their affiliates, have substantial influence over us and could delay or prevent a change in corporate control.\nOur directors and executive officers, together with their affiliates, beneficially owned approximately 6.2 million shares of our common stock as of December 31, 2016. These stockholders, acting together, have the ability to significantly influence the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors and any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. In addition, these stockholders, acting together, have the ability to significantly influence the management and affairs of our company. Accordingly, this concentration of ownership might harm the market price of our common stock by:\n\u2022\ndelaying, deferring or preventing a change in corporate control;\n\u2022\nimpeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us; or\n\u2022\ndiscouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\nFuture sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase common stock, including pursuant to our equity incentive plans, could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to fall.\nAdditional capital will be needed in the future to continue our planned operations. To the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution. We may sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time. If we sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in more than one transaction, investors may be materially diluted by subsequent sales. These sales may also result in material dilution to our existing stockholders, and new investors could gain rights superior to our existing stockholders.\nPursuant to our equity incentive plans, our management is authorized to grant stock options and other equity-based awards to our employees, directors and consultants. We have reserved 9,860,000 shares of our common stock for issuance under our equity incentive plans as of December 31, 2016, which includes 2,960,000 shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of options outstanding as of December 31, 2016, 25,000 shares of common stock issuable upon the vesting of performance stock units, and approximately 57,000 restricted stock units, each of which will become eligible for sale in the public market in the future, subject to certain legal and contractual limitations. In addition, as of December 31, 2016, warrants to purchase 0 shares of our common stock were outstanding. Pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan, eligible employees may participate in an employee stock purchase plan sponsored by us. The current plan allows for the issuance of 1,290,954 shares of common stock to eligible employees. As of December 31, 2016, there were 1,290,594 shares available for future sale to employees under this plan. Shares of our common stock issued upon exercise of these warrants may be sold in the public market, subject to prior registration or under an exemption from registration.\nIf securities or industry analysts cease to publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which might cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nWe may be required to pay severance benefits to our employees who are terminated in connection with a change in control, which could harm our financial condition or results.\nEach of our executive officers is party to an employment agreement, and each of our other employees is party to an agreement or participates in a plan that provides change in control severance benefits including cash payments for severance and other benefits and acceleration of vesting of stock options and other equity awards in the event of a termination of employment in connection with a change in control of us. The payment of these severance benefits could harm our financial condition and results. The accelerated vesting of options and equity awards could result in dilution to our existing stockholders and harm the market price of our common stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions contained in our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company. These provisions could also make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. These provisions include:\n\u2022\na staggered board of directors;\n\u2022\nauthorizing the board to issue, without stockholder approval, preferred stock with rights senior to those of our common stock;\n\u2022\nauthorizing the board to amend our bylaws and to fill board vacancies until the next annual meeting of the stockholders;\n\u2022\nprohibiting stockholder action by written consent;\n\u2022\nlimiting the liability of, and providing indemnification to, our directors and officers;\n\u2022\neliminating the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings; and\n\u2022\nrequiring advance notification of stockholder nominations and proposals.\nSection 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law prohibits, subject to some exceptions, \"business combinations\" between a Delaware corporation and an \"interested stockholder,\" which is generally defined as a stockholder who becomes a beneficial owner of 15% or more of a Delaware corporation's voting stock, for a three-year period following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder.\nThese and other provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws under Delaware law could discourage potential takeover attempts, reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future\nfor shares of our common stock and result in the market price of our common stock being lower than it would be without these provisions.\nOur ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had $526.7 million of federal and $385.3 million of state net operating loss carryforwards available to offset future taxable income. Under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, if a corporation undergoes an \"ownership change\" (generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three year period), the corporation's ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income may be limited. We have completed studies through December 31, 2015, to determine whether any ownership change has occurred since our formation and have determined that transactions have resulted in two ownership changes, as defined under Section 382. There could be additional ownership changes in the future that could further limit the amount of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards that we can utilize.", "PERMNO": 14707, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "RDUS"}
