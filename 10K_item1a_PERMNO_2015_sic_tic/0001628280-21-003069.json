{"cik": "1001233", "company": "SANGAMO THERAPEUTICS, INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-24", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nOur business involves significant risks, some of which are described below. Before making investment decisions regarding our common stock, you should carefully consider these risks, as well as the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our financial statements and the related notes and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d The occurrence of any of the events or developments described below could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, prospects and stock price. In such event, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. In addition, there are also additional risks not described below that are either not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial, and these additional risks could also materially impair our business, operations or market price of our common stock.\nRisks Relating to Research, Development, Regulatory Approval and Commercialization of Our Product Candidates and Technologies\nOur success depends substantially on clinical trial results demonstrating safety and efficacy of our product candidates to the satisfaction of regulatory authorities. We may be unable to obtain positive clinical trial results and regulatory approvals for any of our product candidates.\nWe are a clinical-stage biotechnology company with no approved products and no product revenues. We have ongoing clinical trials evaluating product candidates that use our platform technologies in gene therapy and cell therapy and we\nanticipate initiating additional clinical trials in the future on other product candidates. We are substantially dependent on the results of these clinical trials, and there is no guarantee that final results of clinical trials conducted on our product candidates now or in the future will demonstrate the safety and efficacy of any of our product candidates. In addition, none of our product candidates have obtained regulatory approval. Obtaining positive clinical trial results and regulatory approvals is expensive, lengthy, challenging and unpredictable and may never occur for any of our product candidates. If we fail to obtain positive clinical trial results and regulatory approvals for our product candidates, our anticipated revenues from our product candidates and our prospects for profitability would be adversely affected, which would likely cause the market price of our common stock to significantly decline.\nConducting clinical trials and obtaining regulatory approvals is complex and exposes our business to numerous risks, including potential unexpected costs and delays.\nWe must conduct extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates to the satisfaction of regulatory authorities in order to obtain regulatory approvals necessary for commercialization. We have limited experience in conducting later stage clinical trials and may not possess the necessary resources and expertise to complete such trials. Clinical trials are expensive, lengthy and unpredictable. We cannot guarantee that any clinical trials will be conducted as planned or completed on schedule, if at all. A failure of one or more clinical trials can occur at any stage. Events that may prevent successful or timely completion of clinical development and regulatory approval include, among others:\n\u2022delays in reaching a consensus with regulatory authorities on clinical trial design;\n\u2022delays in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective clinical research organizations, or CROs, and clinical trial sites;\n\u2022delays in opening clinical trial sites or obtaining required institutional review board, or IRB, or independent ethics committee approval at each clinical trial site;\n\u2022delays in recruiting and enrolling suitable patients to participate in our clinical trials;\n\u2022delays in clinical trial activities due to the evolving COVID-19 global pandemic and the diversion of healthcare resources to fight the pandemic, such as the delays that have previously impacted clinical trial timelines for our Fabry and TX200 programs;\n\u2022imposition of clinical holds by regulatory authorities as a result of serious adverse events or after an inspection of clinical trial operations or trial sites;\n\u2022failure by us, any CROs we engage or any other third parties to adhere to clinical trial requirements;\n\u2022failure to perform in accordance with the Good Clinical Practice regulations of the U.S. FDA, or applicable regulatory guidelines in the EU and other countries;\n\u2022delays in the testing, validation, manufacturing and delivery of our product candidates to the clinical sites, including delays by third parties with whom we have contracted to perform certain of those functions, or as a result of manufacturing or formulation changes to our product candidates;\n\u2022delays in having patients complete participation in a trial or return for post-treatment follow-up;\n\u2022clinical trial sites or patients dropping out of a trial;\n\u2022selections of clinical endpoints that require prolonged periods of clinical observation or analysis of the resulting data;\n\u2022occurrences of serious adverse events or other safety concerns associated with product candidates that are viewed to outweigh their potential benefits, result in approval delays or other regulatory restrictions, or harm our reputation;\n\u2022occurrences of serious adverse events or other safety concerns in clinical trials of the same class of agents conducted by other sponsors;\n\u2022failures to demonstrate that product candidates are safe and effective for their proposed indication;\n\u2022changes in regulatory requirements and guidance that require amending or submitting new clinical protocols;\n\u2022unexpected costs and expenses and lack of sufficient funding to develop our product candidates; and\n\u2022losses of licenses to critical intellectual properties.\nWe have not yet reached agreement with regulatory authorities on the complete development pathway for certain product candidates, and such authorities have the ability to change decisions or guidance with respect to approvable endpoints, particularly as the technology continues to develop in these areas. For example, we are aware of another company developing a gene therapy to treat hemophilia A that the FDA recommended complete its Phase 3 study and submit two-year follow-up safety and efficacy data on all study participants notwithstanding the company\u2019s contention that it and the FDA had previously agreed on the extent of data necessary to support a BLA.\nDue to the novelty of certain product candidates and their technologies, the endpoints needed to support regulatory approvals will likely be different from those originally anticipated. Any inability to successfully complete preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates, or complete such trials in the time frames anticipated, could result in additional costs to us or impair our ability to generate revenues from product sales or achieve regulatory and commercialization milestones and royalties, or shorten any periods during which we may have exclusivity.\nEven if a product candidate successfully obtains approval from the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, any approval might contain significant limitations related to use restrictions for specified age groups, warnings, precautions or contraindications, or may be subject to burdensome post-approval study or risk management requirements. Also, any regulatory approval of our product candidates, once obtained, may be withdrawn. If we are unable to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals for our product candidates in one or more jurisdictions, or if any approval contains significant limitations, we would not be able to generate anticipated revenues and may struggle to become profitable, which would have an adverse effect on our business operations and financial conditions.\nSuccess in research and preclinical studies or early clinical trial results may not be indicative of results obtained in later trials. Likewise, preliminary, initial or interim data from clinical trials may be materially different from final data.\nResults from research and preclinical studies or early clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of future clinical trial results, and interim results of a clinical trial are not necessarily indicative of final results. Our product candidates may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy in clinical trials despite demonstrating positive results in preclinical studies or having successfully advanced through initial clinical trials or preliminary stages of clinical trials. From time to time, we have and may in the future publish or report preliminary, initial or interim data. Preliminary, initial or interim data from our clinical trials and those of our collaborators may not be indicative of the final results of the trial and are subject to the risk that one or more of the clinical outcomes may materially change as patient enrollment continues and/or more patient data become available. In this regard, such data may show initial evidence of clinical benefit, but as patients continue to be followed and more patient data becomes available, there is a risk that any therapeutic effects will not be durable in patients and/or will decrease over time, or cease entirely. Preliminary, initial or interim data also remain subject to audit and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from such preliminary, initial or interim data. As a result, preliminary, initial or interim data should be considered carefully and with caution until the final data are available. For example, there can be no assurance that the steady-state FVIII levels shown in the preliminary follow-up data presented in December 2020 by Pfizer and us from the Phase 1/2 Alta study of giroctocogene fitelparvovec will persist in future follow-up or any other data from the Alta study, or that giroctocogene fitelparvovec will ultimately demonstrate a clinical benefit in the final results of the Alta study or in the Phase 3 AFFINE clinical trial of giroctocogene fitelparvovec.\nThere is no guarantee that any of our pending clinical trials will be successful. Many of our product candidates currently use our ZFP technology platform, including ZFN and ZPT-TF technologies, which has not yet yielded any approved therapeutic products. Moreover, many of our product candidates are preclinical and have never demonstrated any clinical benefit. In addition, our viral delivery systems continue to evolve and have not been used in any approved products. If our product candidates using our ZFP technology platform and viral delivery systems are not able to demonstrate the safe, effective and durable results we are hoping to see in clinical trials, we may be forced to suspend or terminate development of some or all of our product candidates or seek alternative technologies to develop or deliver product candidates.\nIn addition, there is a high failure rate for product candidates proceeding through clinical trials. Many companies in the biopharmaceutical industries have suffered significant setbacks in late-stage clinical trials even after achieving promising results in preclinical testing and earlier-stage clinical trials. Data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities are subject to varying interpretations, which may delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. Any such setbacks could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur product candidates are subject to a lengthy and unpredictable regulatory approval process in each jurisdiction where approval is sought.\nA regulatory authority such as the FDA or the EMA must approve any human therapeutic product before it can be marketed in the jurisdiction it governs. The process for receiving regulatory approval is lengthy and unpredictable, and a product candidate may not withstand the rigors of testing under the process. Before commencing clinical trials in humans in the United States, we must submit an IND, to the FDA. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the EU, for example, a clinical trial authorization, or CTA, must be submitted for each clinical protocol to each country\u2019s national health authority and an independent ethics committee. Only after an IND becomes effective and/or the applicable CTA has been accepted may clinical trials begin. See \u201cBusiness-Government Regulation\u201d for details regarding the regulatory approval processes applicable to our product candidates. While there is some overlap, the regulatory requirements to conduct clinical trials and seek marketing approval vary by jurisdiction. There is no guarantee that the safety studies and other data generated will be sufficient to permit us to conduct clinical trials in all jurisdictions where planned, or once generated, that such clinical trial data will be sufficient to obtain marketing approval in all jurisdictions in which we intend to seek such approval. If we are not able to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals to conduct our clinical trials and commercialize our product\ncandidates, or if such approvals are delayed or suspended, our business, prospects and market price of our common stock would be adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to identify, qualify and enroll sufficient patients for our clinical trials or complete our clinical trials in a timely manner, which could delay or prevent us from proceeding with the development of our product candidates.\nIdentifying, qualifying and enrolling patients in clinical trials of our product candidates, and completing these clinical trials, is critical to our success. Patient enrollment and trial completion is affected by factors including:\n\u2022size of the patient population and process for identifying patients;\n\u2022design of the trial protocol;\n\u2022eligibility and exclusion criteria;\n\u2022perceived risks and benefits of the product candidate under study;\n\u2022perceived risks and benefits of genomic approaches to treatment of diseases;\n\u2022availability of competing therapies and clinical trials;\n\u2022potential delays related to the evolving COVID-19 global pandemic and the diversion of healthcare resources to fight the pandemic;\n\u2022severity of the disease under investigation;\n\u2022availability of genetic testing for potential patients;\n\u2022proximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective patients;\n\u2022required and desired characteristics of patients;\n\u2022ability to obtain and maintain patient consent;\n\u2022risk that enrolled patients will drop out before completion of the trial;\n\u2022patient referral practices of physicians; and\n\u2022ability to monitor patients adequately during and after treatment.\nThe timing of our clinical trials depends on our ability to recruit patients to participate as well as completion of required follow-up periods. There are also a number of other product candidates in development by our competitors, who compete for the same limited patient populations. If we are not able to enroll the necessary number of patients in a timely manner, we may not be able to complete our clinical trials on our desired timelines or at all. If fewer patients are willing to participate in our clinical trials because of negative publicity from adverse events related to genomic medicines, competitive clinical trials for similar patient populations or for other reasons, the timelines for conducting clinical trials of our product candidates may be delayed. These delays could result in increased costs, limitation or termination of clinical trials, and delays in product development timelines. If we are forced to expand to additional jurisdictions to address these challenges, it could impose additional costs, delays and risks. If we are not successful in conducting our clinical trials as planned, it would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, prospects and market price of our common stock.\nWe may encounter difficulties in advancing product candidates from research programs to preclinical and clinical development.\nWe intend to advance our product candidates from research programs through preclinical development and to submit new INDs, CTAs and equivalent filings in other jurisdictions necessary to conduct human clinical trials evaluating our product candidates. The preparation and submission of applications to conduct clinical trials requires us to conduct rigorous and time-consuming preclinical testing and studies and prepare documentation relating to, among other things, the toxicity, safety, manufacturing, chemistry and clinical protocols of our product candidates. We may experience unforeseen difficulties that could delay or otherwise prevent us from executing this strategy successfully. For example, we may encounter problems in the manufacturing of a product candidates and may fail to demonstrate consistency in the formulation of a product candidate. Our preclinical tests may produce negative or inconclusive results, which may lead us to decide, or which may lead regulators to require us, to conduct additional preclinical testing. If we cannot obtain positive results in preclinical testing, we may decide to abandon a product candidate altogether. In addition, our ability to complete and submit such applications to conduct clinical trials may depend on the support of our collaborators and the timely performance of their obligations under relevant collaboration agreements. If our collaborators are not able to perform such obligations or if they choose to slow down or delay the development of a product candidate, we may not be able to submit the clinical trial applications on a timely basis or at all. Furthermore, the submission of applications to conduct clinical trials involves significant cost and labor, and we may not have sufficient resources and personnel to complete the filing of all intended applications, which may force us to scale back the number of applications or forego potential applications that we believe are promising. Any delay, suspension or reduction of our efforts to pursue our preclinical and clinical development strategy could have an adverse effect on our business and cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nSpecial regulatory designations, such as RMAT, or orphan drug designations, may not be available for our product candidates or may not lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process.\nWe have received RMAT, designation for our product candidate to treat severe hemophilia A. Additionally, some of our product candidates, including our product candidate to treat Fabry disease, have also been granted Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA, and some have also been designated Orphan Medicinal Products by the EMA. Regulatory authorities in some jurisdictions, including the United States and the EU, may designate drugs for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs. For additional information regarding these special regulatory designations, see \u201cBusiness-Government Regulation.\u201d\nIf we request such designations for our other current or future product candidates, there can be no assurances that the FDA or the EMA will grant any of our product candidates such designations. Additionally, such designations do not guarantee that any regulatory agency will accelerate regulatory review of, or ultimately approve, those product candidates, nor does it limit the ability of any regulatory agency to grant such designations to product candidates of other companies that treat the same indications as our product candidates prior to our product candidates receiving exclusive marketing approval. Such designations can also be revoked. RMAT designation can be revoked if the criteria for eligibility cease to be met as clinical data emerges. Orphan drug exclusivity may be revoked if any regulatory agency determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.\nOur product candidates may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval, limit the approved indications or commercial potential, or result in significant negative consequences following any potential marketing approval.\nDuring the conduct of clinical trials, patients report changes in their health, including illnesses, injuries and discomforts, to their study doctor. Often, it is not possible to determine whether or not the product candidate being studied caused these conditions, particularly as many of the diseases we are studying have complex comorbidities. If clinical experience indicates that a product candidate has side effects or cause serious or life-threatening side effects, the development of the product candidate may fail or be delayed, or, if the product candidate has received regulatory approval, such approval may be revoked, which would severely harm our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition.\nThere have been several significant adverse side effects in gene therapy treatments in the past, including reported cases of leukemia and death seen in other trials using other genomic therapies. Gene therapy is still a relatively new approach to disease treatment and additional adverse side effects could develop. There also is the potential risk of significantly delayed adverse events following exposure to gene therapy products due to persistent biologic activity of the genetic material or other components of products used to carry the genetic material. Possible adverse side effects that could occur with treatment with gene therapy products include an immunologic reaction early after administration that, while not necessarily adverse to the patient\u2019s health, could substantially limit the effectiveness of the treatment.\nEven if our product development efforts are successful and even if the requisite regulatory approvals are obtained, our products may not gain market acceptance among physicians, patients, healthcare payors and the medical community.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates that we may develop or acquire in the future, the approved product may not gain market acceptance among physicians, healthcare payors, patients or the medical community. Market acceptance of approved products depends on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022the efficacy and safety of the product as demonstrated in clinical trials;\n\u2022the clinical indications and patient populations for which the product is approved;\n\u2022acceptance by physicians, treatment centers and patients of the product as a safe and effective treatment;\n\u2022the adoption of novel genomic therapies by physicians, hospitals and third-party payors;\n\u2022the potential and perceived advantages of the product over alternative treatments;\n\u2022the safety of the product seen in a broader patient group, including its use outside the approved indications;\n\u2022any restrictions on product use together with other medications;\n\u2022the prevalence and severity of any side effects;\n\u2022product labeling or product insert requirements of the FDA or other regulatory authorities;\n\u2022the timing of market introduction of the product as well as competitive products;\n\u2022the development of manufacturing and distribution processes for the product;\n\u2022the cost of treatment in relation to alternative treatments;\n\u2022the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement and the willingness of patients to pay out-of-pocket in the absence of coverage or inadequacy of reimbursement by third-party payors and government authorities;\n\u2022relative convenience and ease of administration; and\n\u2022the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts and those of our collaborators.\nIf any of our product candidates are approved but fail to achieve market acceptance among physicians, patients, healthcare payors or treatment centers, we will not be able to generate significant revenues from the approved product, which would compromise our ability to become profitable.\nEven if we are able to commercialize any approved products, such products may not receive coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors in the United States and in other countries in which we seek to commercialize them, which could harm our business.\nOur ability to commercialize any product successfully will depend, in part, on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available. Government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, determine which medications they will cover and establish reimbursement levels, which can affect demand for, or the price of, any approved product. Given the nature of the product candidates that we are developing, some patients may require treatment only one-time (e.g., single dose administration), and there is substantial uncertainty about the pricing structure for such products, and the level of coverage and reimbursement that will be available for a shift to single-dose treatment as compared to chronic therapy over a patient\u2019s lifetime. If other companies establish a new pricing structure or business model, including payment based on demonstration of long-term efficacy, our ability to price or obtain reimbursement for our products may be adversely affected. If such pricing structure or business model do not adequately fund the costs of our research and development, manufacturing and commercialization efforts, our business may be adversely affected.\nIn addition to uncertainty about the potential pricing structure for certain of our product candidates, cost containment is a recurrent trend in the healthcare industry. Government authorities and third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for certain medications. We cannot be sure that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be available for any product that we commercialize and, if reimbursement is available, what the level of reimbursement will be. If reimbursement is not available or is available only at limited levels, we may be unable to successfully commercialize any product candidate for which we obtain regulatory approval. Our inability to promptly obtain coverage and profitable reimbursement rates from both government-funded and private payors for any approved products that we develop could have an adverse effect on our operating results, our ability to raise capital needed to commercialize products and our overall financial condition.\nRecently enacted and future legislation, including potentially unfavorable pricing regulations or other healthcare reform initiatives, may increase the difficulty and cost for us to obtain regulatory approval of and commercialize our product candidates and affect the prices we may obtain.\nThe regulations that govern, among other things, regulatory approvals, coverage, pricing and reimbursement for new drug products vary widely from country to country. In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to successfully sell any product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. Also, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny recently over biopharmaceutical pricing practices in light of the rising cost of prescription drugs and biologics. Such scrutiny has resulted in several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for biopharmaceutical products. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, have been designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. For a discussion of health reform activity and the current pricing framework, see \u201cBusiness-Government Regulation-Healthcare Reform\u201d and \u201c-Pricing, Coverage and Reimbursement.\u201d\nThe continuing efforts of the government, insurance companies, managed care organizations and other payors of healthcare services to contain or reduce costs of healthcare and/or impose price controls may adversely affect:\n\u2022the demand for our product candidates, if we obtain regulatory approval;\n\u2022our ability to set a price that we believe is fair for our products;\n\u2022our ability to generate revenue and achieve or maintain profitability;\n\u2022the level of taxes that we are required to pay; and\n\u2022the availability of capital.\nAny reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors, which may adversely affect our future profitability.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approval for a product candidate, our products will remain subject to regulatory scrutiny.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approval in a jurisdiction, the regulatory authority may still impose significant restrictions on the indicated uses or marketing of our product candidates or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post-approval studies, post-market surveillance or patient or drug restrictions. For example, the FDA typically advises that patients treated with gene therapy undergo follow-up observations for potential adverse events for a 15-year period. Additionally, the holder of an approved BLA is required to comply with FDA rules and is subject to FDA review and periodic inspections, in addition to other potentially applicable federal and state laws, to ensure compliance with cGMP and adherence to commitments made in the BLA.\nIf we or a regulatory agency discovers previously unknown problems with a product such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, a regulatory agency may impose restrictions relative to that product or the manufacturing facility, including requiring recall or withdrawal of the product from the market or suspension of manufacturing. Moreover, product labeling, advertising and promotion for any approved product will be subject to regulatory requirements and continuing regulatory review. Failure to comply with such requirements, when and if applicable, could subject us to a number of actions ranging from warning letters to product seizures or significant fines, among other actions. See \u201cBusiness-Government Regulation-U.S. Review and Approval Processes\u201d for more information.\nAny government investigation of alleged violations of laws or regulations could require us to expend significant time and resources in response and could generate negative publicity. The occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit our ability to commercialize our product candidates and generate revenues.\nOur employees or contractors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with research, development, manufacturing or regulatory standards and requirements, which could cause significant liability for us and harm our reputation.\nWe are exposed to the risk of fraud or other misconduct by our employees and contractors, including intentional failures to comply with FDA regulations or similar regulations of comparable foreign regulatory authorities, provide accurate information to the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, comply with manufacturing standards we have established, comply with federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations and similar laws and regulations established and enforced by comparable foreign regulatory authorities, report financial information or data accurately or disclose unauthorized activities to us. Misconduct by our employees and contractors could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. It is not always possible to identify and deter such misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business and results of operations, including the imposition of significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, personal imprisonment, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.\nWe may use our financial and human resources to pursue a particular research program or product candidate and fail to capitalize on other programs or product candidates that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nWe have limited resources and may forego or delay pursuit of certain research programs or product candidates that later prove to have greater commercial potential. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities or pursue collaborations rather than retain sole responsibility for development. Our current and future research and development programs for product candidates may not yield any commercially viable products. The evaluation of the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate is forward-looking and based upon assumptions involving, for example and not limited to, market evolution, advances in disease\nstandard of care, competition and reimbursement. This reliance on assumptions means that, if our assumptions prove to be inaccurate or incomplete, we may pursue opportunities that end up having a number of competitors that are more advanced than our product candidates, or we may relinquish valuable rights to a product candidate through strategic collaboration, licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases where it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such product candidate. We may also allocate internal resources to a product candidate in a therapeutic area in which it would have been more advantageous to enter into a collaboration or that does not prove to have viable commercial opportunities. Any failure to use our financial and human resources efficiently could harm our business and operations.\nZFP technology is novel and has never been used to develop any approved, commercially viable therapeutic products.\nOur ZFP technology is a novel technology which to date has not yielded any approved commercially viable therapeutic products, and there can be no guarantee that our product development efforts using ZFP technology will be fruitful. We have invested heavily in development of this technology, and our failure to develop approved, commercially viable products using ZFP technology would significantly limit our business and prospects and would adversely impact the market value of our common stock.\nRisks Relating to Manufacturing\nWe are building manufacturing facilities for clinical trial supplies. We have limited experience manufacturing biopharmaceutical products, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain compliant manufacturing facilities, build additional facilities and manufacture our product candidates as intended.\nWe expect to use both contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, and our own facilities to meet our projected needs for clinical trial supply. In 2020, we completed the construction of an AAV manufacturing facility in our Brisbane, California headquarters building to manufacture Phase 1/2 clinical study supplies for our gene therapy product candidates and we are building additional facilities in our headquarters building and in Valbonne, France to manufacture supplies for our cell therapy product candidates. We expect the cell therapy facilities to be operational by the end of 2021. Building these facilities requires us to transition manufacturing processes and know-how of our product candidates from our CMOs to our own facilities. Transferring manufacturing processes and know-how is complex and involves review and incorporation of both documented and undocumented processes that may have evolved over time. In addition, transferring production to different facilities may require utilization of new or different processes to meet the specific requirements of a given facility. Additional studies may also need to be conducted to support the transfer of certain manufacturing processes and process improvements. We cannot be certain that all relevant know-how and data has been adequately incorporated into the manufacturing process until the completion of studies and evaluations intended to demonstrate the comparability of material previously produced by CMOs with that generated by our facilities. Although some of our employees have experience in the manufacturing of biopharmaceutical products from prior employment at other companies, we, as a company, have no prior experience in biopharmaceutical product manufacturing, and operating these facilities will require us to comply with complex regulations and to continue to hire and retain experienced scientific, quality control, quality assurance and manufacturing personnel. Designing and building manufacturing facilities has been and will continue to be time-consuming and expensive, and we may experience delays or cost overruns. In addition, government approvals are required for us to operate manufacturing facilities and are time-consuming to obtain and maintain. As a manufacturer of biopharmaceutical products, we also will be required to demonstrate and maintain cGMP compliance. These requirements include, among other things, quality control, quality assurance and the maintenance of records and documentation. Furthermore, establishing manufacturing operations will require a reallocation of other resources, particularly the time and attention of our senior management. Even if we are able to establish our own manufacturing capabilities, we could encounter challenges in operating the manufacturing facilities in compliance with cGMP, regulatory or other applicable requirements, resulting in potential negative consequences, including regulatory actions, which could undermine our ability to use these facilities for our own manufacturing needs. Any failure or delay in the development of our manufacturing capabilities could adversely impact the development of our product candidates.\nThe manufacture, storage and transport of our product candidates is complex, expensive, highly regulated and risky, which could hamper their commercial viability.\nThere are significant risks associated with manufacturing, storing and transporting our product candidates including, among others, cGMP compliance, cost overruns, technical problems with process scale-up, specialized facilities, process reproducibility, stability issues, lot consistency, yields and timely availability of highly specific raw materials. Even though product batches released for use in clinical trials undergo sample testing, some defects may only be identified following release. In addition, process deviations or unanticipated effects of approved process changes may result in these intermediate products\nnot complying with stability requirements or specifications. Also, our product candidates must be stored and transported at temperatures within a certain range. If these environmental conditions deviate, our product candidates\u2019 remaining shelf-lives could be impaired or their efficacy and safety could be adversely affected, making them no longer suitable for use. Moreover, product candidates that are biologics involving complex processes, including the development of cell lines or cell systems to produce the biologic, with the challenge of significant variability. There are difficulties in growing large quantities of such cells, consistently and sufficiently isolating certain types of cells and harvesting and purifying the biologic produced by them. The cost to manufacture biologics is generally far higher than traditional small molecule chemical compounds, and the manufacturing process can be difficult to reproduce.\nMoreover, manufacturing, storing and transporting our product candidates is subject to strict regulatory standards, which adds additional production risk. Even if efficacy and safety data from our clinical trials would otherwise support regulatory approval of a product candidate, there is no assurance that we or our CMOs will be able to manufacture our product candidates to specifications at levels necessary to support or maintain regulatory approval by the FDA or other regulatory authorities.\nThus, there is no guarantee we will be successful in establishing a larger-scale commercial manufacturing process for our product candidates or obtaining the needed manufacturing capacity. Due to these manufacturing challenges, there is risk that some of our product candidates could be subject to inventory outages, reputational damage and product liability risks, and result in additional expense and delays to clinical trials and commercialization. Supply interruptions or shortages could result in potential negative impacts to our business, prospects and market price of our common stock.\nIf we use chemical, biological or hazardous materials in a manner that causes injury or violates laws, we may be liable for damages.\nOur research and development activities involve the controlled use of potentially harmful biological materials as well as hazardous materials, chemicals, and various radioactive compounds typically employed in the study of molecular and cellular biology. We routinely use cells in culture and gene delivery vectors, and we employ small amounts of radioisotopes in trace experiments. Although we maintain up-to-date licensing and training programs, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from the use, storage, handling, or disposal of these materials. In the event of contamination or injury, we could be held liable for damages that result, and any liability could exceed our resources. We currently carry insurance covering certain claims arising from our use of these materials. However, if we are unable to maintain our insurance coverage at a reasonable cost and with adequate coverage, our insurance may not cover any liability that may arise. We are subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing the use, storage, handling, and disposal of these materials and specified waste products. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines, penalties and additional liabilities and restrictions on our operations.\nWe currently rely on third parties to conduct some or all aspects of manufacturing of our product candidates for preclinical and clinical development. If one of our third-party manufacturers fails to perform adequately or fulfill our needs, we may be required to incur significant costs and devote significant efforts, to find new suppliers or manufacturers.\nWe currently have limited experience in clinical-scale manufacturing of our product candidates, and we rely in large part upon third-party CMOs to manufacture and supply drug product for our preclinical studies and clinical trials. Although we are in the process of establishing manufacturing facilities in Brisbane, California and Valbonne, France, these facilities will only manufacture limited quantities of our product candidates for our early-stage clinical trials. We intend to continue to rely on third parties for the manufacture of product candidates for later stage clinical trials, and for commercial-scale manufacturing for any approved product. The manufacture of biopharmaceutical products in compliance with the FDA\u2019s cGMP requires significant expertise and capital investment, including the development of advanced manufacturing techniques and process controls. Manufacturers of biopharmaceutical products often encounter difficulties in production, including difficulties with production costs and yields, quality control, including stability of the product candidate and quality assurance testing, shortages of qualified personnel, as well as compliance with strictly enforced cGMP requirements, other federal and state regulatory requirements and foreign regulations. If our manufacturers were to encounter any of these difficulties or otherwise fail to comply with their obligations to us or under applicable regulations, our ability to conduct later-stage clinical trials could be jeopardized. Any delay or interruption in the supply of clinical trial materials could delay the completion of our clinical trials, increase the costs associated with developing our product candidates and, depending upon the period of delay, require us to commence new clinical trials at significant additional expense or terminate the clinical trials completely.\nWe and our CMOs must comply with cGMP requirements enforced by the FDA through its facilities inspection program. These requirements include, among other things, quality control, quality assurance and the maintenance of records and documentation. We and our CMOs may be unable to comply with these cGMP requirements and with other FDA, state and\nforeign regulatory requirements. The FDA or similar foreign regulatory agencies may also implement new standards at any time or change their interpretation and enforcement of existing standards for manufacture, packaging or testing of products. We have limited control over our manufacturers\u2019 compliance with these regulations and standards. Failure to comply with these requirements may result in fines and civil penalties, suspension of production, suspension or delay in product approval, product seizure or recall or withdrawal of product approval. If the safety of any product supplied is compromised due to our manufacturers\u2019 failure to adhere to applicable laws or for other reasons, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our products and we may be held liable for any injuries sustained as a result. Any of these factors could cause a delay of clinical trials, regulatory submissions, approvals or commercialization of our product candidates, entail higher costs or impair our reputation.\nOur current agreements with our CMOs do not provide for the entire supply of the drug product necessary for all anticipated clinical trials or for full scale commercialization. If we and our CMOs cannot agree to the terms and conditions for them to provide the drug product necessary for our clinical and commercial supply needs, we may not be able to manufacture the product candidate until a qualified alternative manufacturer is identified, which could also delay the development of, and impair our ability to commercialize our product candidates.\nThe number of third-party CMOs with the necessary manufacturing and regulatory expertise and facilities is limited, and it could be expensive and take a significant amount of time to arrange for alternative CMOs, which could have an adverse effect on our business. New manufacturers of any product candidate would be required to qualify under applicable regulatory requirements and would need to have sufficient rights under applicable intellectual property laws to the method of manufacturing the product candidate. Obtaining the necessary FDA approvals or other qualifications under applicable regulatory requirements and ensuring non-infringement of third-party intellectual property rights could result in a significant interruption of supply and could require the new manufacturer to bear significant additional costs which may be passed on to us.\nWe and third parties on which we rely may be adversely affected by natural disasters and catastrophic or other events outside of our control, and our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect us from a serious disaster or event.\nNatural disasters could severely disrupt our operations and our facilities, including our current and planned manufacturing facilities in Brisbane, California and Valbonne, France and the manufacturing facilities of our CMOs, and any disruption would likely have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. If a natural disaster, pandemic or epidemic, including the evolving COVID-19 pandemic, political crisis, power outage or any other event that is out of our control occurred that prevented us or third parties on which we rely from using all or a significant portion of our or their facilities, that damaged critical infrastructure or that otherwise disrupted our or their operations, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible for us to continue our business and operations for a substantial period of time. The disaster recovery and business continuity plans we have in place currently are limited and may not prove adequate in the event of a serious disaster or similar event. We may incur substantial expenses as a result of the limited nature of our disaster recovery and business continuity plans, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Such disasters or events occurring at facilities of third parties on which we rely could also negatively impact our business and operations.\nRisks Relating to our Industry\nOur product candidates are based on novel genomic medicine technologies, which makes it difficult to predict the timing and costs of development and of subsequently obtaining regulatory approval.\nWe have concentrated our research and development efforts on genomic medicine, consisting of gene therapy, gene-edited cell therapy and genome engineering. The regulatory approval process for novel product candidates such as ours is unclear and may be lengthier and more expensive than the process for other, better-known or more extensively studied product candidates.\nAdverse developments in clinical trials of genomic medicines conducted by others may cause the FDA or other oversight bodies to change the requirements for approval of our product candidates.\nThese regulatory review committees and advisory groups, and any new guidelines they promulgate, may lengthen the regulatory review process, require us to perform additional preclinical studies or clinical trials, increase our development costs, lead to changes in regulatory positions and interpretations, delay or prevent approval and commercialization of our current or future product candidates or lead to significant post-approval limitations or restrictions. As we advance our product candidates,\nwe will be required to consult with these regulatory and advisory groups and comply with applicable guidelines. If we fail to do so, we may be required to delay or discontinue development of our product candidates. These additional processes may result in a review and approval process that is longer than we otherwise would have expected. Delay or failure to obtain, or unexpected costs in obtaining, the regulatory approval necessary to bring a potential product to market could decrease our ability to generate sufficient product revenue, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects would be harmed. Even if our product candidates are approved, we expect that the FDA will require us to submit follow-up data regarding our clinical trial patients for a number of years after any approval. If this follow-up data shows negative long-term safety or efficacy outcomes for these patients, the FDA may revoke its approval or change the label of our products in a manner that could have an adverse impact on our business.\nIn addition, adverse developments in clinical trials of genomic medicines conducted by others may cause the FDA or other oversight bodies to change the requirements for approval of our product candidates. The FDA and EMA have only very recent and limited experience in the approval of in vivo gene therapy products. As a result, it is difficult to determine how long it will take or how much it will cost to obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates.\nIf we or our competitors develop, acquire, or market technologies or products that are more effective than ours, our financial condition and ability to successfully market or commercialize our product candidates or be profitable would be adversely affected.\nThe biopharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and subject to significant and rapid technological change. We are aware of several companies focused on other methods for editing cells, editing genes and regulating gene expression and a growing number of commercial and academic groups pursuing the development of genome engineering technology. The field of genomic medicine is highly competitive, and we expect competition to persist and intensify in the future from a number of different sources, including biopharmaceutical companies, academic and research institutions, and government agencies that will seek to develop competing products as well as technologies that will compete with our ZFP technology platform. For example, in genome engineering and gene therapy products, competing proprietary technologies with our product development focus include but are not limited to, recombinant proteins, other gene therapy/cDNAs, antisense, siRNA and microRNA approaches, exon skipping, small molecule drugs, monoclonal antibodies, CRISPR/Cas technology and TALE proteins, meganucleases, and MegaTALs. See \u201cBusiness-Competition\u201d for more information on the competition we may face.\nAny products that we or our collaborators or strategic partners develop will enter into highly competitive markets. Even if we are able to generate products that are safe and effective for their intended use, competing technologies may prove to be more effective or less expensive, which, to the extent these competing technologies achieve market acceptance, will limit our revenue opportunities. In some cases, competing technologies have proven to be effective and less expensive. Competing technologies may include other methods of regulating gene expression or modifying genes. ZFNs and ZFP-TFs have broad application in the life sciences industry and compete with a broad array of new technologies and approaches being applied to genetic research by many companies.\nIn addition to possessing competing technologies, our competitors include biopharmaceutical companies with:\n\u2022substantially greater capital resources than ours;\n\u2022larger research and development staffs and facilities than ours; and\n\u2022greater experience in product development and in obtaining regulatory approvals and patent protection.\nThese organizations also compete with us to attract qualified personnel, attract parties for acquisitions, joint ventures or other collaborations and license the proprietary technologies of academic and research institutions that are competitive with our technology, which may preclude us from pursuing similar opportunities. Accordingly, our competitors may succeed in obtaining patent protection or commercializing products before us. Even if our product candidate is more effective, it may be disadvantaged if it is not first to market. In addition, any products that we develop may compete with existing products or services that are well established in the marketplace. Further, some of our product candidates in development are designed for use once. Any success in developing single-dose therapeutics could cause us to lose potential recurring revenues from therapeutics that are designed to be taken over a patient\u2019s lifetime.\nThe evolving COVID-19 pandemic could continue to adversely impact our business and operations and the business and operations of our collaborators, manufacturers and other business partners.\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, outbreak a pandemic,\nand since such time, actions taken around the world to help mitigate the spread of COVID-19 have included varying restrictions on travel, quarantines in certain areas, and forced closures for certain types of public places and businesses, including in the\nthree countries where we have most of our day-to-day operations, the United States, France and the United Kingdom. Our business has been directly impacted by pandemic restrictions aimed at reducing the spread of the disease, including multiple California executive orders, several semi-coordinated San Francisco Bay Area orders, several other state and additional local orders across the country and similar orders outside the United States, which, among other things, direct individuals to shelter at their places of residence, direct businesses and governmental agencies to cease non-essential operations at physical locations, prohibit certain non-essential gatherings, and order cessation of non-essential travel.\nTo comply with these orders, we implemented an operating plan to continue business operations during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, including enhanced workplace safety protocols and modified working schedules in our laboratories. In the United States, employees who are able to fulfill their job duties working from home are required to work from home, and have been doing so since March 2020. These protocols and modifications have slowed our productivity and disrupted our business to a moderate degree and are likely to continue doing so through 2021. For example, we have experienced periodic short-term disruptions to our onsite laboratory and manufacturing operations while addressing positive cases of COVID-19 by onsite workers, and our laboratory and manufacturing operations could experience longer term disruptions in the future in the event of a significant outbreak of COVID-19 among our onsite workers. Moreover, from time to time, we have been required to reorganize and prioritize our research resources to mitigate moderate COVID-19 impacts arising from travel restrictions, laboratory density restrictions and laboratory supply constraints. If our research programs encounter longer-term disruptions, it could impact our ability to support our biopharmaceutical partners as contemplated in our collaboration agreements and could result in adjustments to our research timelines, although we do not believe that the short-term disruptions to date have resulted in any such impacts.\nAdditionally, our Phase 1/2 STAAR clinical study evaluating ST-920, our wholly-owned gene therapy product candidate for the treatment of Fabry disease, has experienced delays in its timeline due to COVID-19 impacts and the diversion of healthcare resources to fight the pandemic. For example, the clinical trial site in the UK for this study has not been able to open due to the significant prevalence of COVID-19 in the UK. Additionally, we have experienced delays in recruiting, enrolling and dosing patients for this study at our US trial sites, due in some part to the understandable hesitation of patients to travel by plane to trial sites not within driving distance and to enter medical facilities during the pandemic and in other part to trial sites prioritizing COVID-19 clinical care over research activities such as the STAAR study. Moreover, we have experienced some short-term delays in sourcing the necessary raw materials to manufacture supplies for the STAAR study due to COVID-19 impacts. We estimate that these challenges have set back our STAAR study timelines three to six months. While we currently still expect to share initial clinical study data by the end of 2021, this timeline could be revised if COVID-19 impacts to our enrollment and dosing of patients and to our sourcing of raw materials for this study intensify because of vaccination delays, new COVID-19 variants or unexpected events.\nIn addition, our STEADFAST clinical study evaluating TX200, our wholly-owned CAR-Treg cell therapy product candidate for the treatment of kidney transplant rejection, has experienced delays in its commencement timeline due to COVID-19 impacts related to manufacturing and technology transfer challenges with our CMOs. We estimate that these challenges have set back our commencement timeline by approximately three months. While we currently still expect to initiate this clinical study by the end of 2021, this timeline could be revised if COVID-19 impacts result in additional delays.\nWith respect to our partnered programs, the timelines for the studies and trials managed by our collaborators are also subject to potential delay in the future if these studies and trials experience similar challenges that we have experienced in our STAAR and STEADFAST studies.\nWhile we have been working with our collaborators, clinical trial sites and CMOs to minimize any impact of COVID-19 on clinical trials and research and development operations conducted by us and our collaborators, we do expect that at least some of our programs will nonetheless experience delays and disruptions in the future due to COVID-19 impacts on the operations of us and our business partners. These delays and disruptions have in the past and could in the future relate to clinical site initiation, patient recruitment and enrollment or dosing of patients. Some patients and clinical trial staff may not be able or willing to comply with clinical trial protocols if quarantines impede movement or interrupt healthcare services.\nIt is uncertain when restrictions will be fully lifted, and if so, when we will be able to resume pre-pandemic work routines. Imposition of government orders, including quarantine and shelter-in-place orders related to COVID-19 or other infectious diseases, is expected to continue to impact personnel at our laboratories and our third-party manufacturing facilities in the United States and other countries, for the foreseeable future, and could impact the availability or cost of materials, which would disrupt our supply chain. Many of our third-party manufacturers which we use for the supply of materials for product candidates or other materials necessary to manufacture product to conduct preclinical tests and clinical trials are located in countries heavily affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and should they experience disruptions in the future, such as temporary closures or suspension of services, we would likely experience delays in advancing these tests and trials.\nWhile the potential economic impact brought by, and the duration of, the COVID-19 pandemic may be difficult to assess or predict, it could continue to result in significant disruption of global financial markets, impairing our ability to access capital, which could in the future negatively affect our liquidity. In addition, a recession or market correction resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic could materially affect our business and the value of our common stock.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business, our clinical development and regulatory efforts will depend on future developments that remain highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence at this time, such as the ultimate duration and severity of the pandemic, travel restrictions, quarantines and social distancing requirements in the United States, France, United Kingdom and other countries, business closures or business disruptions and the effectiveness and timeliness of actions taken in the United States, France, United Kingdom and other countries to contain and treat the disease, including the effectiveness and timing of vaccination programs in the United States and worldwide. Accordingly, we do not yet know the full extent of potential delays or impacts on our business, sales of our products, our clinical and regulatory activities, healthcare systems or the global economy as a whole. However, these effects could have material adverse impacts on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nIn addition, to the extent the evolving COVID-19 pandemic continues to adversely affect our business and results of operations, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks and uncertainties described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nNegative public opinion and increased regulatory scrutiny of genomic medicines may damage public perception of the safety of our product candidates and adversely affect our ability to conduct our business or obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates.\nGenetically modified products are currently subject to public debate and heightened regulatory scrutiny. Gene therapy remains a novel technology, with only two in vivo gene therapy products approved for a genetic disease to date in the United States and only a few in vivo gene therapy products for genetic diseases approved to date in the EU. Public perception may be influenced by claims that gene therapy is unsafe, and gene therapy may not gain the acceptance of the public or the medical community. For example, reports of serious adverse events in a retroviral gene transfer trial for infants with X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (X-linked SCID) in France and subsequent FDA actions putting related trials on hold in the United States had a significant negative impact on the public perception and stock price of certain companies involved in gene therapy, whether or not the specific company was involved with retroviral gene transfer, or whether the specific company\u2019s clinical trials were placed on hold in connection with these events. Other adverse events could occur in the field of genomic medicine that could result in increased regulatory scrutiny, potential regulatory delays or negative impact on public perception genomic medicines, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nIn particular, our success will depend upon physicians who specialize in the treatment of genetic diseases targeted by our product candidates, prescribing treatments that involve the use of our product candidates in lieu of, or in addition to, existing treatments with which they are familiar and for which greater clinical data may be available.\nEven if the regulatory approval for genetically modified products developed using our technology is obtained, our success will also depend on public acceptance of the use of genetically modified products including medicines, plants and plant products. Claims that genetically modified products are unsafe for consumption or pose a danger to the environment may influence public attitudes. Our genetically modified products may not gain public acceptance. More restrictive government regulations or negative public opinion would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects and may delay or impair the development and commercialization of our product candidates or demand for any products we may develop. For example, earlier gene therapy trials led to several well-publicized adverse events, including cases of leukemia and death seen in other trials using other vectors. Serious adverse events in our clinical trials, or other clinical trials involving gene therapy products or our competitors\u2019 products, even if not ultimately attributable to the relevant product candidates, and the resulting publicity, could result in increased government regulation, unfavorable public perception, potential regulatory delays in the testing or approval of our product candidates, stricter labeling requirements for those product candidates that are approved and a decrease in demand for any such product candidates.\nOur current and future relationships with healthcare providers, customers and third-party payors subject us to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, privacy, data security and other healthcare laws and regulations. If we fail to comply with such regulations, we could face substantial penalties and our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects could be adversely affected.\nHealthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. Arrangements with healthcare providers, third-party payors and customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we would market, sell and distribute our products. As a biotechnology company, even though we will not control referrals of healthcare services or bill directly to Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors, federal and state healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse, transparency, health privacy and security and patients\u2019 rights are and will be applicable to our business. For details regarding the restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate see \u201cBusiness-Government Regulation-Additional Regulation\u201d.\nThe scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform, especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations. Scrutiny has also increased, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. Responding to investigations can be time-and resource-consuming and can divert management\u2019s attention from the business. Efforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. If our operations or if any physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business are found to not be in compliance with applicable laws or applicable regulations, we and they could be subjected to significant civil, criminal and administrative enforcement actions, see \u201cBusiness-Government Regulation-Additional Regulation\u201d.\nFurther, we are required to comply with privacy and data security laws, such as the GDPR and the CCPA, and after January 1, 2023, the California Privacy Rights Act, which apply to the collection, use, disclosure, transfer, or other processing of personal data. For more information regarding these regulations, see \u201cBusiness-Government Regulation-Privacy Regulation\u201d. To comply with the GDPR restrictions on the transfer of personal data from Europe, we have relied on Standard Contractual Clauses. However, a July 2020 decision of the EU\u2019s highest court has called into question this practice, and UK authorities may similarly question the viability of the Standard Contractual Clauses as a mechanism for the lawful transfer of personal data outside of that country. Moreover, there is uncertainty regarding how \u2018Brexit\u2019 will impact these practices. If we are unable to implement safeguards necessary to ensure that our transfers of personal data from and within Europe are lawful, we will face increased exposure to regulatory actions, substantial fines, and injunctions against processing personal data from Europe, and could be required to increase our data processing capabilities in Europe at significant expense. Restrictions on our ability to transfer personal data from Europe could impact our clinical trial activities in Europe and limit our ability to collaborate with CROs and other third parties subject to European data protection laws. Other countries may adopt restrictions similar to the GDPR, which could further impact our operations.\nAny failure or alleged failure (including as a result of deficiencies in our policies, procedures or measures relating to privacy, data security, marketing or communications) by us to comply with laws, regulations, policies, legal or contractual obligations, industry standards or regulatory guidance relating to privacy or data security, may result in governmental investigations and enforcement actions, litigation, fines and penalties or adverse publicity. In addition, new regulation, legislative actions or changes in interpretation of existing laws or regulations regarding privacy and data security (together with applicable industry standards) may increase our costs of doing business. In this regard, we expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws, regulations and industry standards relating to privacy and data security in the United States, the EU and other jurisdictions, and we cannot determine the impact such future laws, regulations and standards will have on our business.\nProduct liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to limit commercialization of any products that we may develop.\nWe face inherent risks of product liability exposure related to the testing of our product candidates in human clinical trials and will face even greater product liability risks if we commercially sell any approved products. Product liability claims may be brought against us by subjects enrolled in our clinical trials, patients, healthcare providers or others using, administering or selling our products. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that our product candidates or products caused injuries, we could incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u2022decreased demand for any product candidates or products that we may develop;\n\u2022termination of clinical trial sites or entire trial programs;\n\u2022injury to our reputation and significant negative media attention;\n\u2022withdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u2022significant costs to defend the related litigation;\n\u2022substantial monetary awards to clinical trial patients;\n\u2022loss of revenue;\n\u2022diversion of management and scientific resources from our business operations; and\n\u2022the inability to commercialize any products that we may develop.\nWe currently hold product liability insurance coverage at a level that we believe is customary for similarly situated companies and adequate to provide us with insurance coverage for foreseeable risks, but which may not be adequate to cover all liabilities that we may incur. Insurance coverage is increasingly expensive. We may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise. We intend to expand our insurance coverage for products to include the sale of commercial products if we obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates in development, but we may be unable to obtain commercially reasonable product liability insurance for any products that receive regulatory approval. Large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on drugs that had unanticipated side effects. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us, particularly if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could decrease our cash and adversely affect our business.\nRisks Relating to our Finances\nWe have incurred significant operating losses since inception and anticipate that we will incur continued losses for the foreseeable future.\nWe have generated operating losses since we began operations in 1995. The extent of our future losses and the timing of profitability are uncertain, and we expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future. We have been engaged in developing our ZFP technology since inception, which has and will continue to require significant research and development expenditures. To date, we have generated our funding from issuance of equity securities, revenues derived from collaboration agreements, other strategic partnerships in non-therapeutic applications of our technology, federal government research grants and grants awarded by research foundations. We expect to continue to incur additional operating losses for the next several years as we continue to develop our product candidates. If the time required to generate significant product revenues and achieve profitability is longer than we currently anticipate or if we are unable to generate liquidity through equity financing or other sources of funding, we may be forced to curtail or suspend our operations.\nWe may be unable to raise additional capital on favorable terms, if at all, which would harm our ability to develop our technology and product candidates and could delay or terminate some or all of our programs. Future sales and issuances of equity securities could also result in substantial dilution to our stockholders.\nWe have incurred significant operating losses and negative operating cash flows since inception and have not achieved profitability. We expect capital outlays and operating expenditures to increase over the next several years as we expand our infrastructure and research and product development activities. While we believe our available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2020, when combined with additional capital raises and expected revenues from collaborations, strategic partners and research grants, will be adequate to fund our currently planned operations through at least the next 12 months from the date the financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are issued, we will need to raise substantial additional capital to fund the development, manufacturing and potential commercialization of our product candidates. We regularly consider fund raising opportunities and may decide, from time to time, to raise capital based on various factors, including market conditions and our plans of operation. In addition, as we focus our efforts on proprietary human therapeutics, we will need to seek FDA approvals of our product candidates, a process that could cost in excess of hundreds of millions of dollars per product. We may experience difficulties in accessing the capital markets due to external factors beyond our control, such as volatility in the equity markets for emerging biotechnology companies and general economic and market conditions both in the United States and abroad. For example, our ability to raise additional capital may be adversely impacted by global economic conditions and disruptions to and volatility in the credit and financial markets in the United States and worldwide, which could be impacted by the evolving COVID-19 pandemic. We cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Our failure to obtain adequate and timely funding will adversely affect our business and our ability to develop our technology and products candidates.\nTo the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, including sales pursuant to our at-the-market offering program with Jefferies LLC, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution. We may issue common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time. New investors could gain rights superior to our existing stockholders.\nOur ability to use net operating losses to offset future taxable income may be subject to limitations.\nAlthough a certain amount of our federal net operating loss carryforwards carry forward indefinitely (but are subject to a percentage limitation), a significant amount of our federal and all of our state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire, if not utilized, beginning in 2024 and 2029, respectively. The net operating loss carryforwards subject to expiration could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities. In addition, under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and corresponding provisions of state law, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d which is generally defined as a greater than 50 percentage point change in its equity ownership value over a three-year period, the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income or taxes may be limited. We have experienced an ownership change in the past and we may also experience additional ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership, some of which may be outside of our control. If an ownership change occurs and our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards is materially limited, it would harm our future operating results by effectively increasing our future tax obligations. In addition, at the state level, there may be periods during which the use of net operating loss carryforwards is suspended or otherwise limited, which could accelerate or permanently increase state taxes owed. For example, California has imposed limits on the usability of California state net operating losses to offset California taxable income in tax years beginning after 2019 and before 2023. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, we may be unable to use all or a material portion of our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us and adversely affect our future cash flows.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe market price of our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. In the event securities or industry analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which might cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nRisks Relating to our Reliance on Third Parties\nIf conflicts arise with our contractors, collaborators or other business partners, these conflicts may limit our ability to implement our strategies and may harm our business and prospects.\nIf conflicts arise with our contractors, collaborators or other business partners, the other party will likely act in its self-interest, which may limit our ability to implement our strategies. For example, some of our collaborators are conducting multiple product development efforts within each area that is the subject of their collaboration with us. Our collaborators may develop, either alone or with others, product candidates in related fields that are competitive with the product candidates that are the subject of their collaborations with us. Competing products, either developed by the collaborators or to which the collaborators or have rights, may result in the withdrawal of their support for our product candidates.\nSome of our collaborators could also become our competitors in the future. Our collaborators could develop or invest in competing products, preclude us from entering into collaborations with their competitors, fail to obtain timely regulatory approvals, terminate or breach their agreements with us unexpectedly or prematurely, or fail to devote sufficient resources to the development and commercialization of product candidates covered by the collaboration.\nIn addition, conflicts could arise between us and our collaborators resulting from disputes regarding our or our collaborators\u2019 or strategic partners\u2019 performance under the applicable agreement, including disputes arising from alleged breaches of our agreements with our collaborators.\nAny of these conflicts could harm our product development efforts and otherwise adversely affect our business and prospects.\nOur collaborators control certain aspects of our product development efforts, including certain of our clinical trials, which could result in unanticipated delays and other obstacles in the commercialization of our product candidates.\nWe depend on collaborators to design and conduct certain of our clinical trials for some of our product candidates. As a result, these clinical trials may not be conducted in the manner or on the timeline we desire, which may negatively impact our\nproduct development efforts. In addition, if any of these collaborators withdraws support for our product candidates or otherwise impairs their development, our business could be negatively affected.\nOur lack of control over aspects of product development in our agreements with Novartis, Biogen, Kite, Sanofi, Takeda and Pfizer could cause delays or other difficulties in the development and commercialization of our product candidates, which may prevent us from completing the intended IND filings in a timely fashion and receiving any milestone, royalty payments and other benefits under the agreement. In addition, under their respective agreements, our third-party collaborators have certain rights to terminate the agreements by providing us with advance notices, therefore, the actual milestone payments that we may receive under these agreements may be substantially lower than the full amounts provided for under these agreements.\nOur collaborators licensing our ZFP technologies may decide to adopt alternative technologies or products or may be unable or unwilling to develop commercially viable products with our ZFP technologies, which would negatively impact our revenues and our strategy to develop product candidates using ZFP technologies.\nSeveral of our collaborations leverage our ZFP technology platform. These collaborators may elect to adopt alternative technologies in the future, which could decrease the value of our ZFP technology platform and impede the development of product candidates using the platform. Additionally, because many of our collaborators are likely to be working on more than one development project, they could choose to shift their resources to projects other than those they are working on with us. If they do so, this would delay our ability to test and develop our ZFP technology platform and would delay or terminate the development of our product candidates using the platform. Further, our collaborators may elect not to develop product candidates arising out of our collaborations or not to devote sufficient resources to the development, manufacturing, marketing or sale of these product candidates. If they terminate the collaborations with us and we wish to continue developing the product candidates, we will be required to seek the support of other collaborators or develop the products ourselves. We may not be able to identify a suitable partner or negotiate a favorable collaboration agreement, and we may not have sufficient resources and expertise internally, to allow us to continue the development of these product candidates.\nCommercialization of our technologies will depend, in part, on collaborations with other companies. If we are not able to find collaborators in the future or if our collaborators do not diligently pursue product development efforts, we may not be able to develop our technologies or product candidates, which could slow our growth and decrease the market value of our common stock.\nWe do not have financial resources ourselves to fully develop, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize our product candidates. We rely significantly on our collaborations with other biopharmaceutical companies to provide funding for our research and development efforts, including preclinical studies and clinical tests, and expect to rely significantly on such collaborations to provide funding for the lengthy regulatory approval processes required to commercialize our product candidates.\nFor example, we have collaborations with Novartis to develop product candidates to treat certain neurodevelopment disorders, including autism and intellectual disability; with Biogen to develop product candidates to treat tauopathies including Alzheimer\u2019s disease, alpha-synuclein related diseases including Parkinson\u2019s disease and other neurological diseases; with Kite to develop product candidates to treat cancer; with Pfizer to develop product candidates to treat hemophilia A and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal lobar degeneration linked to mutations of the C9ORF72 gene; and with Sanofi to develop product candidates to treat beta thalassemia and sickle cell disease.\nIf we are unable to secure additional collaborations or if our collaborators are unable or unwilling to diligently advance the development, regulatory approval and commercialization of our product candidates, our growth may slow and adversely affect our ability to generate funding for development of our technologies and product candidates. In addition, our collaborators may sublicense or abandon development programs with little advance notice, or we may have disagreements or disputes with our collaborators, which would cause associated product development to slow or cease. In addition, the business or operations of our collaborators may change significantly through restructurings, acquisitions, other strategic transactions that may negatively impact their ability to advance our programs. The evolving COVID-19 pandemic could similarly impact our ability to realize the expected benefits of our collaborations due to the impacts of the pandemic on our collaborators and their business and operations.\nUnder typical collaborations, we expect to receive revenue for the research and development of our product candidates based on achievement of specific milestones, as well as royalties based on a percentage of sales of any commercialized products. Achieving these milestones will depend, in part, on the efforts of our collaborators as well as our own efforts. If we or any collaboration partner fails to meet specific milestones, then the collaboration agreement may be terminated, which could\nreduce our revenues. In addition, if sales of commercialized products fail to meet expectations, we could receive lower royalties than expected.\nRisks Relating to our Intellectual Property\nBecause it is difficult, time consuming and costly to obtain, maintain and enforce patent protections for our technologies and product candidates, and because third parties may have made inventions that are similar to ours, we may not be able to secure optimal patent protections of our technologies and product candidates.\nOur commercial success may depend in part on obtaining, maintaining and enforcing patent protection for our technologies and product candidates and successfully defending any of our patents that may be challenged. Obtaining and enforcing biopharmaceutical patents is costly, time consuming and complex, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications in all desired jurisdictions, or maintain, enforce and license any patents that may issue from such patent applications, at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner or at all. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection. The patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies can be highly uncertain and can involve complex legal and factual questions. No consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in biotechnology patents has emerged to date. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth of claims that may issue from any patent applications that we own or license, nor are we able to predict whether any third-party patents might issue with claims that are relevant to our product candidates or technologies. Even if patents do successfully issue and even if such patents cover our technologies and product candidates, third parties may challenge their validity, enforceability or scope, which may result in such patents being narrowed or invalidated. There is no assurance that all of the potentially relevant prior art relating to our patents and patent applications has been found, which can invalidate a patent or prevent a patent from issuing from a pending patent application. Furthermore, if third parties have made similar inventions, there are multiple ways they could impact the coverage of our own applications.\nWe are a party to various license agreements that grant us rights under specified patents and patent applications. We are also party to various license agreements by which we grant third parties rights under specified patents and patent applications. Our current licenses contain performance obligations. If we fail to meet those obligations, the licenses could be terminated. If we are unable to continue to license these technologies on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, we may be forced to delay or terminate aspects of our product development and research activities.\nWe are unable to exercise the same degree of control over intellectual property that we license from third parties as we exercise over our internally developed intellectual property. We do not control the prosecution of certain of the patent applications that we license from third parties; therefore, the patent applications may not be prosecuted as we desire or in a timely manner.\nThe degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain, and we cannot ensure that:\n\u2022we or our licensors were the first to make the inventions covered by each of our pending patent applications;\n\u2022we or our licensors were the first to file patent applications for these inventions;\n\u2022the patents of others will not have an adverse effect on our ability to do business;\n\u2022others will not independently develop similar or alternative technologies or reverse engineer any of our products, processes or technologies;\n\u2022any of our pending patent applications will result in issued patents;\n\u2022any patents issued or licensed to us, our collaborators or strategic partners will provide a basis for commercially viable products or will provide us with any competitive advantages;\n\u2022any patents issued or licensed to us will not be challenged and invalidated by third parties;\n\u2022the laws in the U.S. and foreign countries will not change or be interpreted in a way that modifies our patent rights or impacts our ability to enforce or maintain our patent rights; or\n\u2022we will develop additional products, processes or technologies that are patentable.\nOthers have filed and in the future are likely to file patent applications that are similar to ours. We are aware that there are academic groups and other companies that are attempting to develop technology that is based on the use of zinc finger, TALE, CRISPR/Cas and other DNA-binding proteins, and that these groups and companies have filed patent applications. Several patents with claims directed to this technology have issued, although we have no current plans to use the claimed inventions. If these or other patent applications issue as patents, it is possible that the holder of any patent or patents granted on these applications may bring an infringement action against us, our collaborators, or strategic partners claiming damages and seeking to enjoin commercial activities relating to the affected products and processes. The costs of litigating the claim could be substantial regardless of outcome. Moreover, we cannot predict whether we, our collaborators, or strategic partners would\nprevail in any actions. In addition, if the relevant patent claims were upheld as valid and enforceable and our products or processes were found to infringe a patent or patents, we or our collaborators may have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees for willful infringement, and we may be prevented from making, using, or selling the relevant product or process unless we or our collaborators could obtain a license or were able to design around the patent claims. We can give no assurance that such a license would be available to us or our collaborators on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or that we would be able to successfully design around the relevant patent claims. There may be significant litigation in the genomics or cell therapy industry regarding patent and other intellectual property rights, which could subject us to costly, lengthy and distracting litigation with unpredictable results.\nWe rely on trade secrets to protect technology where we believe patent protection is not appropriate or obtainable. Trade secrets, however, are difficult to protect. While we require employees, academic collaborators and consultants to enter into confidentiality agreements, we may not be able to adequately protect our trade secrets or other proprietary information or enforce these confidentiality agreements.\nOur collaborators, strategic partners, and scientific advisors have rights to publish data and information in which we may have rights. If we cannot maintain the confidentiality of our technology and other confidential information in connection with our collaborations and strategic partnerships, then we may not be able to receive patent protection or protect our proprietary information.\nPatent terms may be inadequate to protect our competitive position on our product candidates for an adequate amount of time and may vary based on jurisdiction.\nPatents have a limited lifespan. In the United States, the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years from its earliest U.S. non-provisional filing date or from the filing date of the corresponding international application. Various extensions may be available. However, the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. Even if patents covering our product candidates are obtained, once the patent life has expired for a product, we may be open to competition from generic medications. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, the value of our technology could be adversely affected, and our business would be harmed.\nWe rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect proprietary know-how that is not patentable or that we elect not to patent, processes for which patents are difficult to enforce and any other elements of our product candidate discovery and development processes that involve proprietary know-how, information or technology that is not covered by patents. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, collaborators, partners and contractors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures have been and may in the future be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. See also the risk factor titled, \u201cSignificant disruptions of our information technology systems or data security incidents could result in significant financial, legal, regulatory, business and reputational harm to us.\u201d In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors.\nAlthough we expect all of our employees and consultants to assign their inventions to us, and all of our employees, consultants, advisors, collaborators, partners and any third parties who have access to our proprietary know-how, information or technology to enter into confidentiality agreements, we cannot provide any assurances that all such agreements have been duly executed or that our trade secrets and other confidential proprietary information will not be disclosed or that competitors will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques. Misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of our trade secrets could impair our competitive position and may have an adverse effect on our business. Additionally, if the steps taken to maintain our trade secrets are deemed inadequate, we may have insufficient recourse against third parties for misappropriating the trade secret. In addition, others may independently discover our trade secrets and proprietary information.\nFurther, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent or in the same manner as the laws of the United States. As a result, we may encounter significant problems in protecting and defending our intellectual\nproperty both in the United States and abroad. If we are unable to prevent material disclosure of the non-patented intellectual property related to our technologies to third parties, and there is no guarantee that we will have any such enforceable trade secret protection, we may not be able to establish or maintain a competitive advantage in our market, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may not be successful in obtaining or maintaining necessary rights to product components, platforms and processes for our development pipeline through acquisitions and in-licenses.\nPresently, we believe we have rights to the intellectual property, through licenses from third parties and under patents that we own, to develop our gene and cell therapy product candidates. Because our programs may involve additional product candidates, such as TX200 and potential future CAR-Treg therapies that may require the use of proprietary rights held by third parties, the growth of our business will likely depend in part on our ability to acquire, in-license or use these proprietary rights. In addition, our product candidates may require specific formulations to work effectively and efficiently and these rights may be held by others. We may be unable to acquire or in-license any compositions, methods of use, processes or other third-party intellectual property rights from third parties that we identify on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. The licensing and acquisition of third-party intellectual property rights is a competitive area, and a number of more established companies are also pursuing strategies to license or acquire third-party intellectual property rights, including from other companies and academic institutions, that we may consider attractive. Other companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, cash resources and greater clinical development and commercialization capabilities.\nIn addition, companies that perceive us to be a competitor may be unwilling to assign or license rights to us. We also may be unable to license or acquire third-party intellectual property rights on terms that would allow us to make an appropriate\nreturn on our investment. If we are unable to successfully obtain rights to required third-party intellectual property rights, our business, financial condition and prospects for growth could suffer.\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations in the agreements under which we license intellectual property rights from third parties or otherwise experience disruptions to our business relationships with our licensors, we could lose license rights that are important to our business.\nWe are a party to a number of intellectual property license agreements that are important to our business and expect to enter into additional license agreements in the future. Our existing license agreements impose, and we expect that future license agreements will impose, various diligence, milestone, royalty and other obligations on us. If we fail to comply with our obligations under these agreements, or we are subject to a bankruptcy, the licensor may have the right to terminate the license, in which event we would not be able to market products covered by the license.\nWe may need to obtain licenses from third parties to advance our research or allow commercialization of our product candidates, and we have done so from time to time. We may fail to obtain any of these licenses at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms, if at all. In that event, we may be required to expend significant time and resources to develop or license replacement technology. If we are unable to do so, we may be unable to develop or commercialize the affected product candidates, which could harm our business significantly. We cannot provide any assurances that third-party patents do not exist that might be enforced against our current product candidates or future products, resulting in either an injunction prohibiting our sales, or, with respect to our sales, an obligation on our part to pay royalties and/or other forms of compensation to third parties.\nIn many cases, patent prosecution of our in-licensed technology is controlled solely by the licensor. If our licensors fail to obtain and maintain patent or other protection for the proprietary intellectual property we license from them, we could lose our rights to the intellectual property or our exclusivity with respect to those rights, and our competitors could market competing products using the intellectual property. In certain cases, we control the prosecution of patents resulting from licensed technology. In the event we breach any of our obligations related to such prosecution, we may incur significant liability to our licensing partners. Licensing of intellectual property is of critical importance to our business and involves complex legal, business and scientific issues and is complicated by the rapid pace of scientific discovery in our industry.\nThe agreements under which we currently license intellectual property or technology from third parties are complex, and certain provisions in such agreements may be susceptible to multiple interpretations. The resolution of any contract interpretation disagreement that may arise could narrow what we believe to be the scope of our rights to the relevant intellectual property or technology, or increase what we believe to be our financial or other obligations under the relevant agreement, either of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. If disputes over intellectual property that we have licensed prevent or impair our ability to maintain our current licensing arrangements on acceptable terms, we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize the affected product candidates, which could\nhave an adverse effect on our business, financial conditions, results of operations and prospects. As an example, Sangamo France has exclusively licensed the right to the CAR for use in TX200 from the University of British Columbia, or UBC. Should UBC terminate this license agreement, we may have to develop or acquire the appropriate CAR which would extend our anticipated development timeline and add expense, and which could result in our failure to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of Sangamo France.\nWe may be involved in patent or intellectual property lawsuits or similar disputes involving patents under our control or patents of third parties claiming infringement, which lawsuits could be expensive, time-consuming and impair or prevent development and commercialization activities.\nOur commercial success depends in part on our avoiding infringement of the patents and proprietary rights of third parties. There is a substantial amount of litigation, both within and outside the United States, involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including patent infringement lawsuits, interferences, oppositions, ex parte reexaminations, post-grant review and inter partes review proceedings before the U.S. PTO, and corresponding foreign patent offices. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields in which we are pursuing development candidates. As the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are issued, the risk increases that our product candidates may be subject to claims of infringement of the patent rights of third parties.\nThird parties may assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization, and such parties may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. There may be third-party patents or patent applications with claims to materials, formulations, methods of manufacture or methods for treatment related to the use or manufacture of our product candidates. For example, we are aware of certain patents held by third parties related to certain vector and vector manufacturing methods that are related to certain of our product candidates. We have not yet finalized the commercial scale manufacturing process for any of our product candidates. If our commercial scale manufacturing process utilizes these vector manufacturing methods, and if these third-party patents are valid and in force at the time of commercialization, we may need to challenge these patents, use or develop non-infringing alternatives or seek a license to these patents. In any event, if any third-party patents were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover our product candidates, any molecules formed during the manufacturing process or any final product itself, the holders of any such patents may be able to block or hinder our ability to commercialize such product candidate unless we obtained a license under the applicable patents, or until such patents expire. Similarly, if any third-party patents were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover aspects of our formulations or processes for manufacture or methods of use, the holders of any such patents may be able to block our ability to develop and commercialize the applicable product candidate unless we obtained a license, or until such patents expires. Moreover, because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending patent applications that may later result in issued patents that our product candidates may infringe.\nDefense of these claims, regardless of their merit, would involve substantial litigation expense, could expose proprietary information and would be a substantial diversion of employee resources from our business. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we may have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees for willful infringement, pay royalties, redesign our infringing products or obtain one or more licenses from third parties, which may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure.\nCompetitors may also infringe our patents or the patents of our licensors. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours or our licensors is not valid, is unenforceable, in whole or in part, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated, held unenforceable or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing. Moreover, if we or one of our licensing partners initiated legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent covering one of our product candidates, the defendant could counterclaim that the patent covering our product candidate is invalid and/or unenforceable. Such proceedings could result in revocation or amendment to our patents in such a way that they no longer cover our product candidate. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. With respect to the validity question, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art, of which we and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity and/or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on our product candidates. Such a loss of patent protection could have an adverse impact on our business.\nInterference or derivation proceedings provoked by third parties or brought by us or declared by the U.S. PTO may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions or other matters of inventorship with respect to our patents or patent applications or those of our licensors. An unfavorable outcome could expose us to significant monetary damages, result in the loss of valuable intellectual property, require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or if a non-exclusive license is offered and our competitors gain access to the same technology. Our defense of litigation, interference, derivation or other proceedings may fail and, even if successful, may result in substantial costs and distract our management and other employees. We may not be able to prevent, alone or with our licensors, misappropriation of our intellectual property rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the United States.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees, consultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information of third parties or that our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers.\nWe employ individuals who were previously employed at universities or other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although we try to ensure that our employees, consultants and independent contractors do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or our employees, consultants or independent contractors have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any of our employee\u2019s former employer or other third parties. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel, which could adversely impact our business. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees.\nWe may be unable to license gene transfer technologies that we may need to commercialize our ZFP technology and potential products, if approved.\nIn order to regulate or modify a gene in a cell, the ZFP must be efficiently delivered to the cell. We have licensed certain gene transfer technologies for our ZFP in research, including AAV and mRNA technology, and we are evaluating these systems and other technologies that may need to be used in the delivery of ZFP into cells for in vitro and in vivo applications. We have not developed our own gene transfer technologies, and we rely on our ability to enter into license agreements to provide us with rights to the necessary gene transfer technology. Our approach has been to license appropriate technology as required. For example, we are aware of certain patents held by a third party related to certain vector manufacturing methods that are currently being used in certain of our product candidates. We have not yet finalized the commercial scale manufacturing process for any of our product candidates. If our commercial scale manufacturing process utilizes these vector manufacturing methods, and if these third-party patents are in force at the time of commercialization, we may need to use or develop a non-infringing manufacturing method or seek a license to these patents. However, we may not be able to license the gene transfer technologies on reasonable terms, if at all, required to develop and commercialize our product candidates. The inability to obtain a license to use gene transfer technologies with entities that own such technology on reasonable commercial terms, if at all, could delay or prevent the preclinical evaluation, drug development collaborations, clinical testing and/or commercialization of our therapeutic product candidates.\nRisks Relating to our Business Operations\nSignificant disruptions of our information technology systems or data security incidents could result in significant financial, legal, regulatory, business and reputational harm to us.\nWe are increasingly dependent on information technology systems and infrastructure to operate our business, which are large and complex. In the ordinary course of our business, we collect, store, process and transmit large amounts of sensitive information, including intellectual property, proprietary business information, personal data (including personal health information) and other confidential information. It is critical that we do so in a secure manner to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of such sensitive information. We have also outsourced elements of our operations (including elements of our information technology infrastructure) to third parties, and as a result, we manage a number of third-party vendors who may or could have access to our computer networks or our confidential information. Many of those third parties in turn subcontract or outsource some of their responsibilities to third parties. While all information technology operations are inherently vulnerable to inadvertent or intentional security breaches, incidents, attacks and exposures, the size, complexity, accessibility and distributed nature of our information technology systems, and the large amounts of sensitive information stored on those systems, make such systems potentially vulnerable to unintentional or malicious, internal and external attacks\non our technology environment. Attacks of this nature are increasing in their frequency, levels of persistence, sophistication and intensity. In addition, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have intensified our dependence on information technology systems as many of our critical business activities are currently being conducted remotely and our increased reliance on personnel working from home could increase our cybersecurity risk.\nSignificant disruptions of our, our third-party vendors\u2019 and/or business partners\u2019 information technology systems or other similar data security incidents could adversely affect our business operations and/or result in the loss, misappropriation, and/or unauthorized access, use or disclosure of, or the prevention of access to, sensitive information, which could result in financial and reputational harm to us. For example, in April 2018, we announced a data security incident involving the compromise of a senior executive\u2019s company email account. Our investigation of the incident did not reveal any evidence that our systems were otherwise compromised in connection with the incident or that personal data about patients or other individuals besides the executive were accessed or disclosed. However, proprietary, confidential and other sensitive information of ours and that of other entities was accessed and may have been compromised as a result of the incident. Unforeseen developments related to this incident could occur, which could have a further adverse impact on us. Any litigation or regulatory review or investigation arising from this incident could result in significant legal exposure to us. In addition, information technology system disruptions, whether from attacks on our technology environment or from computer viruses, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures, could result in a material disruption of our facility, development programs and our business operations. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or future clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data.\nWhile we are aware of the company email incident described above, there is no way of knowing with certainty whether we have experienced any other data security incidents that have not been discovered. While we have no reason to believe this to be the case, attackers have become very sophisticated in the way they conceal access to systems, and many companies that have been attacked are not aware that they have been attacked. Any delay in the discovery of an attack may result in increased expense and may harm our reputation. Any event, including the company email incident described above, that leads to unauthorized access, use or disclosure of personal data could, among other consequences, disrupt our business, harm our reputation, compel us to comply with applicable federal and/or state data breach notification laws and foreign law equivalents. In addition, failure to maintain effective internal accounting controls related to security breaches and cybersecurity in general could impact our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements and subject us to regulatory scrutiny. While we have implemented security measures intended to protect our information technology systems and infrastructure, there can be no assurance that such measures will successfully prevent service interruptions or further security incidents.\nWe have business operations in France and the United Kingdom, which exposes us to additional costs and risks.\nOur business operations in France and the United Kingdom subject us to certain additional costs and risks associated with doing business outside the United States, including:\n\u2022the increased complexity and costs inherent in managing international operations in geographically disparate locations;\n\u2022challenges of complying with diverse regulatory, financial and legal requirements, which are subject to change at any time;\n\u2022potentially adverse tax consequences, including changes in applicable tax laws and regulations;\n\u2022potentially costly trade laws, tariffs, export quotas, custom duties or other trade restrictions, and any changes to them;\n\u2022compliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad;\n\u2022liabilities for activities of, or related to, our international operations;\n\u2022challenges inherent in efficiently managing employees in diverse geographies, including the need to adapt systems, policies, benefits and compliance programs to differing labor and other regulations;\n\u2022natural disasters, political and economic instability, including wars, terrorism and political unrest, outbreak of health epidemics, including the evolving COVID-19 pandemic, and the resulting global economic and social impacts;\n\u2022workforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States; and\n\u2022differing laws and regulations relating to data security and the unauthorized use of, or access to, commercial and personal information.\nIn addition, our international operations in France and the United Kingdom expose us to fluctuations in currency exchange rates between the Euro and the U.S. dollar and between the Pound Sterling and the U.S. dollar. Given the volatility of currency exchange rates, there is no assurance that we will be able to effectively manage currency transaction and/or conversion risks. To date, we have not entered into derivative instruments to offset the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations, which fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In any event, difficulties resulting\nfrom these and other risks related to our operations outside of the United States could expose us to increased expenses, impair our development efforts, adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and harm our competitive position.\nWe are in the process of growing the size of our organization globally, and we may experience difficulties in hiring, integrating and retaining qualified skilled employees.\nWe need to grow the size of our organization in order to support our research, product development, manufacturing and regulatory efforts, and such growth is critical to our success. We may not be able to hire, integrate and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees with the appropriate levels of experience and skills to accomplish our growth objectives. There currently is a shortage of skilled individuals with substantial experience discovering, developing and manufacturing genomic medicines, which is likely to continue. As a result, competition for these individuals is intense and the turnover rate can be high. We may not be able to hire, integrate and retain employees with these skills on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous biopharmaceutical companies and academic institutions for individuals with these skills. In addition, any negative or unexpected results in our preclinical or clinical trials or applications for marketing approval would make it more challenging to hire and retain qualified skilled employees. Moreover, the evolving COVID-19 pandemic has further challenged our ability to hire skilled employees. If we do not achieve our growth objectives, the progress of our research, development, manufacturing and regulatory efforts will slow down, which will adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe are dependent on certain key members of our executive team and certain of our scientific, clinical development and manufacturing personnel, the loss of whose services may impede the progress of our research, development, manufacturing and regulatory efforts. While we have entered into employment agreements with each of our executive officers, any of them could leave our employment at any time, as all of our employees are \u201cat will\u201d employees. We do not have \u201ckey person\u201d insurance on any of our employees.\nWe may not be successful in our efforts to discover, license or acquire new potential product candidates and may fail to capitalize on product candidates with a greater commercial opportunity or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nIf our existing product candidates do not receive regulatory approval or are not successfully commercialized, then the success of our business will depend on our ability to continue to expand our product pipeline through discovery, in-licensing or acquisitions. We may be unable to do so. If we do identify potential product candidates for licensing or acquisition, we may be unable to reach acceptable terms with the licensors or sellers. Further, there may be risks and liabilities associated with the product candidates which our due diligence efforts fail to discover, that are not disclosed to us, that we inadequately assess, or that we are unable to manage effectively. Additionally, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of such licenses or acquisitions for a variety of reasons, including the possibility that the product candidates prove not to be safe or effective in clinical trials, that we are unable to successfully integrate the product candidate into our operations, or that the anticipated benefits will not otherwise be realized within the expected timeframe.\nAdditionally, because we have limited resources, we may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with certain product candidates or indications that later prove to have greater commercial potential. Our spending on current and future research and development programs may not yield any commercially viable products. If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through strategic collaboration, licensing or other arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such product candidate. Alternatively, we may allocate internal resources to a product candidate in a therapeutic area in which it would have been more advantageous to enter into a collaboration arrangement.\nRisks Relating to our Common Stock and Corporate Organization\nOur stock price has been volatile and will likely continue to be volatile, which could result in substantial losses for investors, and could be influenced by public perception of genomic medicines and the biotechnology sector.\nOur stock price has been volatile and may continue to be volatile, which could cause stockholders to incur substantial losses. An active public market for our common stock may not be sustained, and the market price of our common stock may continue to be volatile. The market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control, including but not limited to the following:\n\u2022announcements by us or collaborators providing updates on the progress or development status of product candidates or data from clinical trials;\n\u2022initiation or termination of clinical trials;\n\u2022changes in market valuations of similar companies;\n\u2022overall market and economic conditions, including the equity markets for emerging biotechnology companies;\n\u2022deviations in our results of operations from the guidance given by us;\n\u2022announcements by us or our competitors of new or enhanced products or technologies or significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic relationships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u2022announcement of changes in business and operations by our collaborators, or changes to our existing collaboration agreements;\n\u2022changes in public opinions of genomic medicines;\n\u2022regulatory developments, including increased regulatory scrutiny of genomic medicines;\n\u2022changes, by one or more of our securities analysts, in recommendations, ratings or coverage of our stock;\n\u2022additions or departures of key personnel; and\n\u2022sales of our common stock or other securities by us, officers or directors, liquidation of institutional funds that comprised large holdings of our stock and decreases in our cash balances.\nIn addition, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies, including very recently in connection with the evolving COVID-19 pandemic, which has resulted in decreased stock prices for many companies notwithstanding the lack of a fundamental change in their underlying business models or prospects. These fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. Broad market and industry factors, including potentially worsening economic conditions and other adverse effects or developments relating to the evolving COVID-19 pandemic, and political, regulatory and other market conditions, may negatively affect the market price of shares of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nActual or potential sales of significant amounts of shares of our common stock into the market could cause the market price of our common stock to fall or prevent it from increasing for numerous reasons.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. These sales, or the perception in the market that holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock. Our outstanding shares of common stock generally may be freely sold in the public market at any time to the extent permitted by Rules 144 and 701 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, or to the extent the issuance of such shares has already been registered under the Securities Act and are held by non-affiliates of ours. While Biogen agreed not to sell any of the shares that we issued to Biogen in April 2020 until the first anniversary of the effectiveness of the Biogen collaboration, and to limit resales through the second anniversary, such restrictions are only temporary. Further, we also agreed, subject to certain limitations, to register for resale under the Securities Act any of the shares we issued to Biogen. We have also filed registration statements registering all shares of common stock that we may issue under our equity compensation plans. Such shares can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance, subject to volume limitations and black-out periods applicable to affiliates. Additionally, we are party to a sales agreement with Jefferies LLC which permits us from time to time at our discretion to sell up to $150.0 million of shares of our common stock in the public markets at prevailing market prices. As of February 19, 2021, we have sold 1,034,762 shares of our common stock under the sales agreement for net proceeds of approximately $15.7 million.\nIn addition, in accordance with the guidelines specified under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and our policies regarding stock transactions, certain of our employees, executive officers and directors have adopted, and may continue to adopt, stock trading plans pursuant to which they have arranged to sell shares of our common stock from time to time in the future. Generally, sales under such plans by our executive officers and directors require public filings. Our employees, executive officers, directors and affiliated stockholders also may buy or sell additional shares outside of a Rule 10b5-1 plan when they are not in possession of material, nonpublic information. Actual or potential sales of our common stock by such persons could be viewed negatively by other investors and could cause the price of our common stock to fall or prevent it from increasing.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock so any returns will be limited to the value of our stock.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to the appreciation of their stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our certificate of incorporation, Delaware law and our bylaws could make an acquisition of our company more difficult and could prevent attempts by our stockholders to remove or replace current management.\nAnti-takeover provisions of Delaware law and in our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company, even if a change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors. In particular, under our certificate of incorporation our board of directors may issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock with rights and privileges that might be senior to our common stock, without the consent of the holders of the common stock. Moreover, without any further vote or action on the part of the stockholders, the board of directors would have the authority to determine the price, rights, preferences, privileges, and restrictions of the preferred stock. This preferred stock, if it is ever issued, may have preference over, and harm the rights of, the holders of common stock. Although the issuance of this preferred stock would provide us with flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes, this issuance may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock.\nSimilarly, our authorized but unissued common stock is available for future issuance without stockholder approval. Our certificate of incorporation further provides that stockholders may not take action by written consent.\nIn addition, our amended and restated bylaws:\n\u2022establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholders\u2019 meetings; and\n\u2022prohibit stockholders from calling a special meeting of stockholders.\nWe are also subject to Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, which provides, subject to certain exceptions, that if a person acquires 15% of our voting stock, the person is an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d and may not engage in \u201cbusiness combinations\u201d with us for a period of three years from the time the person acquired 15% or more or our voting stock. The application of Section 203 may, in some circumstances, deter or prevent a change in control of our company even when such change may be beneficial to our stockholders.\nOur amended and restated bylaws designate exclusive forums for the adjudication of certain disputes, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to bring claims in a judicial forum it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that a state or federal court located within the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for:\n\u2022any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf;\n\u2022any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee or stockholder of Sangamo to us or our stockholders;\n\u2022any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, our charter or our bylaws, as to which the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware; and\n\u2022any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine.\nOur amended and restated bylaws further provide that a federal district court of the United State is the sole and exclusive forum for any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. These provisions further provide that any person or entity that acquires any interest in shares of our capital stock will be deemed to have notice of and consented to these provisions.\nThese provisions may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and other employees. If a court were to find any of these provisions to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, which could seriously harm our business.", "PERMNO": 88195, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "SGMO"}
