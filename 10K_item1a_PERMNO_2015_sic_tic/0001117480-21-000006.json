RISK FACTORS\nExcept for the historical information contained herein or incorporated by reference, this Annual Report and the information incorporated by reference contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include projections about our research, development and commercialization efforts, our accounting and finances, plans and objectives for the future, future operating and economic performance and other statements regarding future performance. These statements are not guarantees of future performance or events. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed here. Factors that could cause or contribute to differences in our actual results include those discussed in the following section, as well as those discussed in Part II, Item 7 entitled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and elsewhere throughout this Annual Report and in any other documents incorporated by reference into this Annual Report. You should consider carefully the following risk factors, together with all of the other information included or incorporated in this Annual Report. Each of these risk factors, either alone or taken together, could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition, as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock. There may be additional risks that we do not presently know of or that we currently believe are immaterial which could also impair our business and financial position.\nAn investment in shares of our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following information about these risks, together with the other information appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report, before deciding to invest in our common stock. The occurrence of any of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects. In these circumstances, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Condition and Need For Additional Capital\nWe have incurred significant losses since our inception. We anticipate that we will continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future, and we may never achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe are a biopharmaceutical company focused primarily on developing brincidofovir (BCV) for the treatment of smallpox, ONC201 for the treatment of recurrent H3 K27M-mutant glioma and dociparstat (DSTAT) for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and the treatment of acute lung injury (ALI) in COVID-19 patients. We have incurred significant net losses in each year since our inception, including net losses of $43.5 million, $112.6 million and $69.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $712.4 million.\nTo date, we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities and, to a lesser extent, through government funding, licensing fees and debt. We have devoted most of our financial resources to research and development, including our preclinical development activities and clinical trials. We have not completed development of any product candidates. We may continue to incur losses and negative cash flows for the foreseeable future. The size of any loss will depend, in part, on the rate of future expenditures and our ability to generate revenues. In particular, we expect to incur substantial expenses as we seek to:\n\u2022continue development and manufacturing activities of imipridones, including ONC201 for the treatment of recurrent H3 K27M-mutant glioma, and other potential indications;\n\u2022continue development and manufacturing activities of DSTAT for the treatment of AML, the treatment of ALI in COVID-19 patients, and other potential indications;\n\u2022continue the development of BCV for the treatment of smallpox as a medical countermeasure;\n\u2022obtain regulatory approvals for BCV, ONC201 and DSTAT;\n\u2022scale-up manufacturing capabilities to commercialize BCV and DSTAT in the event we receive regulatory approval;\n\u2022identify and in-license additional product candidates to expand our research and development pipeline;\n\u2022maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; and\n\u2022continue our internal research and development efforts and seek to discover additional product candidates.\nTo become and remain profitable, we must succeed in developing and eventually commercializing products with significant market potential. This will require us to be successful in a range of challenging activities, including acquiring or discovering product candidates, completing preclinical testing and clinical trials of our product candidates, obtaining regulatory approval for these product candidates, and manufacturing, marketing and selling those products for which we may obtain regulatory approval. We are only in the preliminary stages of some of these activities.\nTo date, we have not obtained regulatory approval for any product candidate, and none of our product candidates have been commercialized. We may never succeed in developing or commercializing any product candidate. If we do not successfully develop or commercialize any product candidate, or if revenues from any products that do receive regulatory approvals are insufficient, we will not achieve profitability and our business may fail. Even if we successfully obtain regulatory approval to market a product candidate in the United States, our revenues are also dependent upon the size of markets outside of the United States, as well as our ability to obtain market approval and achieve commercial success outside of the United States.\nEven if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become and remain profitable would depress the value of our company and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, diversify our product offerings or continue our operations. A decline in the value of our company could cause you to lose all or part of your investment.\nOur ability to generate future revenues from product sales is uncertain and depends upon our ability to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for, and commercialize product candidates.\nOur ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability depends on our ability, alone or with collaborators, to successfully complete the development, obtain the necessary regulatory approvals and commercialize product candidates. We may not generate revenues from product sales for the foreseeable future. Our ability to generate future revenues from product sales depends heavily on our success in:\n\u2022obtaining favorable results for and advancing development of imipridones, including ONC201 for the treatment of recurrent H3 K27M-mutant glioma, and other potential indications;\n\u2022obtaining favorable results for and advancing the development of DSTAT for the treatment of AML and ALI, and BCV for the treatment of smallpox;\n\u2022obtaining United States and foreign regulatory approval(s) for ONC201, DSTAT and BCV;\n\u2022generating, licensing or otherwise acquiring a pipeline of product candidates which progress to clinical development, regulatory approval, and commercialization.\nConducting preclinical testing and clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data required to obtain regulatory approval and achieve product sales. Our anticipated development costs would likely increase if we do not obtain favorable results or if development of any product candidate is delayed. In particular, we would likely incur higher costs than we currently anticipate if development of any product candidate is delayed because we are required by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities to perform studies or trials in addition to those that we currently anticipate, or we decide to conduct additional studies or trials for strategic reasons.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with pharmaceutical product development, we are unable to predict with certainty the timing or amount of any increase in our anticipated development costs that will result should any additional trials be necessary.\nIn addition, any product candidate, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. Our commercial revenues, if any, will be derived from sales of products that we may not be commercially available for a number of years, if at all. Even if any product candidate is approved for commercial sale, we anticipate incurring significant costs in connection with commercialization. As a result, we cannot assure you that we will be able to generate revenues from sales of any approved product candidate, or that we will achieve or maintain profitability even if we do generate sales.\nIf we fail to obtain additional financing, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs, seek corporate partners for the development of our product development programs or relinquish or license on unfavorable terms, our rights to technologies or product candidates.\nDeveloping pharmaceutical products, including conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials, is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete. We believe that our existing capital available to fund operations will enable us to fund our current operating expenses and capital requirements for at least the next twelve months. Changing circumstances beyond our control may cause us to consume capital more rapidly than we currently anticipate, and our clinical trials may encounter technical, enrollment or other difficulties that could increase our development costs more than we expected, or because the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities require us to perform studies or trials in addition to those that we currently anticipate.\nIn July 2019, we entered into a License and Development Agreement with Cantex in which we acquired an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize DSTAT. We are currently enrolling a Phase 2/3 study of DSTAT in ALI for patients with COVID-19 and plan to initiate a Phase 3 trial in AML in early 2021.\nIn January 2021, we acquired Oncoceutics, Inc. (Oncoceutics), a privately-held, clinical-stage biotechnology company developing imipridones, a novel potential class of compounds. Oncoceutics\u2019 lead product candidate, ONC201, selectively induced cell death in multiple cancer types in clinical trials. ONC201 is currently being evaluated in multiple clinical studies including in a registrational program for recurrent H3 K27M-mutant glioma.\nWe are also pursuing additional external opportunities to build our pipeline of product candidates, and we may need to raise additional funds if we identify additional product candidates, which we may obtain through one or more equity offerings, debt financings, government or other third-party funding, strategic alliances and licensing or collaboration arrangements.\nSecuring additional financing may divert our management from our day-to-day activities, which may adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our most advanced clinical compounds, or any other product candidate. In addition, we cannot guarantee that future financing will be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when required or on acceptable terms, we may be required to:\n\u2022significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of BCV, ONC201, DSTAT, or any other product candidate;\n\u2022seek corporate partners for BCV, ONC201, DSTAT, or any other product candidate at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable or on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be available; or\n\u2022relinquish or license on unfavorable terms, our rights to technologies or product candidates that we otherwise would seek to develop or commercialize ourselves.\nIf we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, we will be prevented from pursuing development and commercialization efforts, which will have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and prospects and on our ability to develop our product candidates.\nWe are evaluating external assets to build our pipeline of product candidates and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying or completing a transaction for a candidate, that any such transaction will result in additional value for our stockholders or that the process will not have an adverse impact on our business.\nIn early 2019, we initiated a review of external assets that could be added to our pipeline of product candidates. In July 2019, in connection with this process, we entered into a License and Development Agreement with Cantex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Cantex) pursuant to which we acquired exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize DSTAT for any and all uses. In January 2021, we acquired Oncoceutics, a privately-held, clinical-stage biotechnology company developing imipridones, including ONC201. In connection with these transactions, we are responsible for, and bear the future costs of, development and commercialization of the acquired compounds. These costs will be substantial, and we may require additional capital in order to pursue the development and commercialization of these compounds as planned. Moreover, the anticipated benefits of these transactions may never be realized due to the various risks and uncertainties associated with drug development detailed elsewhere in the following risk factors.\nIn addition to DSTAT and ONC201, we may in-license or acquire additional assets, engage in a merger or acquisition transaction, issue additional shares of our common stock, or engage in other potential actions designed to maximize stockholder value. Our continuing review of external assets may not result in the identification or consummation of any transaction. The process of reviewing external opportunities may be time consuming and disruptive to our business operations and, if we are unable to effectively manage the process, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. We could incur substantial expenses associated with identifying, evaluating, negotiating, and consummating potential transactions. There can be no assurance that any potential additional transaction, if consummated, will provide greater value to our stockholders than that reflected in the current price of our common stock. In addition, once any potential additional transaction is consummated, we are likely to incur substantial costs associated with future development and testing of any new product candidate, which may require us to raise additional capital.\nRisks Related to Clinical Development and Regulatory Approval\nWe face risks related to the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, which could significantly disrupt our preclinical studies and clinical trials.\nThe duration and the geographic impact of the business disruption and related financial impact resulting from the coronavirus cannot be reasonably estimated at this time and our business could be adversely impacted by the effects. We are currently conducting clinical trials of our product candidates in the United States. We rely on independent clinical investigators, contract research organizations and other third-party service providers to assist us in managing, monitoring and otherwise carrying out\nour non-clinical studies and clinical trials, and the outbreak may affect their ability to devote sufficient time and resources to our programs. Similarly, clinical site initiation and patient enrollment may be delayed due to concerns for patient safety and prioritization of healthcare resources toward the COVID-19 pandemic. We also rely on third party suppliers and contract manufacturers to produce the drug product we utilize in our clinical trials, and the outbreak may cause delays in delivery and increases in the cost of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and drug product. As a result, the expected timeline for data readouts of our non-clinical studies and clinical trials and certain regulatory filings may be negatively impacted, and our APIs and drug product may become more expensive to obtain. The COVID-19 pandemic is also causing disruption of global financial markets which, if sustained or recurrent, could make it more difficult for us to access capital. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is highly uncertain and subject to change, and may adversely affect our business, healthcare systems and the global economy as a whole.\nOur product candidates are still under clinical development and may not obtain regulatory approval or be successfully commercialized.\nWe have not marketed, distributed or sold any products. Our product candidates are ONC201, which we are developing for the treatment of recurrent H3 K27M-mutant glioma, DSTAT, which we are developing for the treatment of AML, the treatment of ALI in COVID-19 patients, and other potential indications and BCV, which we continue to develop for the treatment of smallpox as a medical countermeasure. We are in late stage clinical development for both ONC201 and DSTAT. The new drug application (NDA) for BCV as a medical countermeasure for the treatment of smallpox is currently under FDA review and has a PDUFA date of April 7, 2021.\nThere is no guarantee that our current or future clinical trials will be approved by regulators, and no guarantee that they will be completed or, if completed, will be successful, or if successful, will result in an approval for the sale of any of our product candidates. The success of each of DSTAT and BCV will depend on several factors, including the following:\n\u2022generating positive safety and efficacy data from our clinical trials of DSTAT and ONC201;\n\u2022acceptance of data from our studies of oral BCV in animal models, including analyses necessary to bridge to a recommended human dose, by the FDA and foreign regulatory bodies;\n\u2022receipt of marketing approvals from the FDA and corresponding regulatory authorities outside the United States;\n\u2022establishing manufacturing capabilities necessary for a registration trial and commercialization of DSTAT;\n\u2022establishing commercial manufacturing capabilities for BCV;\n\u2022acceptance of the product, if approved for marketing;\n\u2022effectively competing with other therapies;\n\u2022a continued acceptable safety profile of the product following approval; and\n\u2022obtaining, maintaining, enforcing and defending intellectual property rights and claims.\nIf we do not achieve one or more of these factors in a timely manner or at all, we could experience significant delays or an inability to successfully commercialize BCV, ONC201, and DSTAT, which would materially harm our business.\nWe have never obtained regulatory approval for a drug and we may be unable to obtain, or may be delayed in obtaining, regulatory approval for most advanced clinical candidates: BCV, ONC201 and DSTAT.\nWe have never obtained regulatory approval for a drug. It is possible that the FDA and/or foreign health authorities, such as the EMA, may refuse to accept our NDA (or corresponding foreign application) for substantive review or may conclude after review of our data that our application is insufficient to obtain regulatory approval of any of our lead clinical candidates.\nThrough our continuing development contract with BARDA, we completed the second rabbitpox efficacy study as well as a pivotal efficacy study in the mouse model (ectromelia virus). We believe that efficacy data from these models could support the approval of BCV for the treatment of smallpox. The NDA for BCV is currently under review by FDA and has a PDUFA date of April 7, 2021.\nIn July 2019, we entered into a license agreement with Cantex where we acquired an exclusive license to global development and commercialization rights to DSTAT. We are currently enrolling a Phase 2/3 study of DSTAT in ALI for patients with COVID-19 and a Phase 3 trial in AML.\nIn January 2021, we acquired Oncoceutics, a privately-held, clinical-stage biotechnology company developing imipridones, a novel potential class of compounds. Oncoceutics\u2019 lead product candidate, ONC201, is currently being evaluated in multiple clinical studies including in a registrational program for recurrent H3 K27M-mutant glioma.\nWe have not yet reached agreement with the FDA or foreign regulators regarding the adequacy of these planned studies, for any of our most advanced clinical candidates, with respect to a potential approval for marketing. We may be required to conduct additional clinical, nonclinical or manufacturing validation studies and submit those data before reconsideration of our application occurs. Depending on the extent of these or any other required studies, approval of any NDA or application that we submit may be delayed by several years, or may require us to expend more resources than we have available. It is also possible that additional studies, if performed and completed, may not be considered sufficient by the FDA and/or foreign health authorities to approve our NDA or foreign application.\nAny delay in obtaining, or an inability to obtain, regulatory approvals could prevent us from generating revenues and achieving and sustaining profitability. If any of these outcomes occur, we may be forced to abandon our development efforts for ONC201, DSTAT and BCV, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and could potentially cause us to cease operations.\nWe depend on the successful completion of clinical trials for our product candidates, including BCV, ONC201 and DSTAT. The positive clinical results obtained for our product candidates in prior clinical studies may not be repeated in future clinical studies.\nBefore obtaining regulatory approval for the sale of our product candidates, including BCV, ONC201 and DSTAT, we must conduct extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates. Clinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and is uncertain as to outcome. A failure of one or more of our clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing. The outcome of preclinical testing and early clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials, and interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results. Moreover, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and many companies that have believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval for their products.\nWe may experience a number of unforeseen events during, or as a result of, clinical trials or animal efficacy studies for our product candidates, that could adversely affect the completion of our clinical trials, including:\n\u2022regulators or institutional review boards may not authorize us or our investigators to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site;\n\u2022clinical trials of our product candidates may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon product development programs;\n\u2022animal efficacy studies of our product candidates may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us to conduct additional animal efficacy studies or abandon development programs;\n\u2022we might be required to change one of our clinical research organizations (CROs) during ongoing clinical programs;\n\u2022the number of subjects required for clinical trials of our product candidates may be larger than we anticipate, enrollment in these clinical trials may be insufficient or slower than we anticipate, or subjects may drop out of these clinical trials at a higher rate than we anticipate;\n\u2022our third-party contractors may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner, or at all;\n\u2022we may have to suspend or terminate clinical trials of our product candidates for various reasons, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to unacceptable health risks, or other factors such as the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022regulators or institutional review boards may require that we or our investigators suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements;\n\u2022the cost of clinical trials of our product candidates may be greater than we anticipate;\n\u2022we may encounter agency or judicial enforcement actions which impact our clinical trials;\n\u2022the supply or quality of our product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials of our product candidates may be insufficient or inadequate; or\n\u2022our product candidates may have undesirable side effects or other unexpected characteristics, causing us or our investigators to suspend or terminate the trials.\nWe do not know whether any clinical trials we may conduct will demonstrate adequate efficacy and safety to result in regulatory approval to market our most advanced product candidates, including BCV, ONC201 and DSTAT. If later stage clinical trials do not produce favorable results, our ability to obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates may be adversely impacted.\nDelays in clinical trials are common and have many causes, and any delay could result in increased costs to us and jeopardize or delay our ability to obtain regulatory approval and commence product sales.\nClinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete, and is uncertain as to outcome. We may experience delays in clinical trials at any stage of development and testing of our product candidates. Our planned clinical trials may not begin on time, have an effective design, enroll a sufficient number of subjects, or be completed on schedule, if at all.\nEvents which may result in a delay or unsuccessful completion of clinical trials, including our currently planned or future clinical trials for any of BCV, ONC201, or DSTAT, include:\n\u2022inability to raise funding necessary to initiate or continue a trial;\n\u2022delays in obtaining, or failure to obtain, regulatory approval of Investigational New Drug applications or to commence a trial;\n\u2022delays in reaching agreement with the FDA and foreign health authorities on final trial design;\n\u2022imposition of a clinical hold following an inspection of our clinical trial operations or trial sites by the FDA or other regulatory authorities;\n\u2022delays caused by disagreements with existing CROs and/or clinical trial sites;\n\u2022delays in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective CROs and clinical trial sites;\n\u2022delays in obtaining, or failure to obtain, required IRB or ethics committee (EC) approvals covering each site;\n\u2022delays in recruiting suitable patients to participate in a trial;\n\u2022delays in having subjects complete participation in a trial or return for post-treatment follow-up;\n\u2022delays caused by subjects dropping out of a trial due to side effects or otherwise;\n\u2022clinical sites declining to participate or dropping out of a trial to the detriment of enrollment;\n\u2022agency or judicial enforcement actions against us;\n\u2022time required to add new clinical sites; and\n\u2022delays by our contract manufacturers to produce and deliver sufficient supply of clinical trial materials.\nMany of the above factors may be caused or exacerbated by the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. If initiation or completion of any of our clinical trials for our product candidates, are delayed for any of the above reasons, our development costs may increase, our approval process could be delayed, any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidates may be reduced and our competitors may have more time to bring products to market before we do. Any of these events could impair our ability to generate revenues from product sales and impair our ability to generate regulatory and commercialization milestones and royalties, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur product candidates may cause adverse effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval or limit the scope of any approved label or market acceptance.\nAdverse events (AEs) caused by our product candidates could cause us, other reviewing entities, clinical study sites or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical studies and could result in the denial of regulatory approval. For example, subjects enrolled in our clinical trials for BCV have experienced gastrointestinal AEs and liver-related safety laboratory value changes. In addition, BCV is related to the approved drug cidofovir, a compound which has been shown to result in significant renal toxicity and impairment following use. As a second example, subjects enrolled in clinical trials for DSTAT have experienced febrile neutropenia and liver enzyme elevations. If an unacceptable frequency and/or severity of AEs are reported in our clinical trials for our product candidates, our ability to obtain regulatory approval for product candidates may be negatively impacted.\nIf any of our approved products cause serious or unexpected side effects prior to or after receiving market approval, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:\n\u2022regulatory authorities may approve the product only with a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS), potentially with restrictions on distribution and other elements to assure safe use (ETASU);\n\u2022regulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of the product or impose restrictions on its distribution in a form of a modified REMS;\n\u2022regulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, such as warnings or contraindications;\n\u2022we may be required to change the way the product is administered or to conduct additional clinical studies;\n\u2022we could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients; and\n\u2022our reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product candidate and could substantially increase the costs of commercializing our product candidates.\nAfter the completion of our clinical trials, we cannot predict whether or when we will obtain regulatory approval to commercialize any of our product candidates and we cannot, therefore, predict the timing of any future revenue from BCV, ONC201 or DSTAT.\nWe cannot commercialize our product candidates, including BCV, ONC201 and DSTAT, until the appropriate regulatory authorities have reviewed and approved the product candidate. The regulatory agencies may not complete their review processes in a timely manner, or we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates. Additional delays in the United States may result if any of our product candidates is brought before an FDA advisory committee, which could recommend restrictions on approval or recommend non-approval of the product candidate. In the EU context, an Oral Explanation during MAA review could extend approval timelines and result in a Negative Opinion. A re-examination procedure is available in the EU whereby a Negative Opinion could be over-turned and become a Positive Opinion. New rapporteurs would be selected for the product. In addition, we may experience delays or rejections based upon additional government regulation from future legislation or administrative action, or changes in regulatory agency policy during the period of product development, clinical studies and the review process. As a result, we cannot predict when, if at all, we will receive any future revenue from commercialization of any of our product candidates.\nThe FDA has granted rare pediatric disease designation to ONC201 for the treatment of glioblastoma. However, a marketing application for ONC201, if approved, may not meet the eligibility criteria for a priority review voucher.\nThe FDA has granted rare pediatric disease designation to ONC201 for treatment of H3 K27M-mutant glioma. Designation of a drug as a drug for a rare pediatric disease does not guarantee that an NDA for such drug will meet the eligibility criteria for a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher at the time the application is approved. Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), we will need to request a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher in our original NDA for ONC201. The FDA may determine that an NDA for ONC201, if approved, does not meet the eligibility criteria for a priority review voucher, including for the following reasons:\n\u2022treatment of H3 K27M-mutant glioma no longer meets the definition of a rare pediatric disease;\n\u2022the NDA contains an active ingredient (including any ester or salt of the active ingredient) that has been previously approved in an NDA;\n\u2022the NDA is not deemed eligible for priority review;\n\u2022the NDA does not rely on clinical data derived from studies examining a pediatric population and dosages of the drug intended for that population (that is, if the NDA does not contain sufficient clinical data to allow for adequate labeling for use by the full range of affected pediatric patients); or\n\u2022the NDA is approved for a different adult indication than the rare pediatric disease for which ONC201 is designated.\nThe authority for the FDA to award rare pediatric disease priority review vouchers for drugs that have received rare pediatric disease designation prior to September 30, 2024 currently expires on September 30, 2026, although it is possible the FDA\u2019s authority to award rare pediatric disease priority review vouchers will be further extended through federal lawmaking. Absent any such extension, if the NDA for ONC201 is not approved prior to September 30, 2026 for any reason, regardless of whether it meets the criteria for a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher, it will not be eligible for a priority review voucher.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, including BCV, ONC201 and DSTAT, we will still face extensive regulatory requirements and our products may face future development and regulatory difficulties.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approval, the granting authority may still impose significant restrictions on the indicated uses, distribution or marketing of our product candidates, including ONC201, DSTAT and BCV, or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post-approval studies or post-market surveillance. For example, the labeling ultimately approved for our product candidates, will likely include restrictions on use due to the specific patient population and manner of use in which the drug was evaluated and the safety and efficacy data obtained in those evaluations. In addition, the distribution of ONC201, DSTAT or BCV may be tightly controlled through a REMS with ETASU, which are required medical interventions or other actions healthcare professionals need to execute prior to prescribing or dispensing the drug to the patient. Some actions may also be required in order for the patient to continue on treatment. For example, the label for BCV may be required to include a boxed warning, or \u201cblack box,\u201d regarding BCV being carcinogenic, teratogenic and impairing fertility in animal studies. The BCV labeling may also include warnings pertaining to gastrointestinal AEs or liver-related safety laboratory value changes or black boxes related to the mortality disadvantage with extended dosing observed in the SUPPRESS trial.\nOur product candidates will also be subject to additional ongoing regulatory requirements governing the labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, safety surveillance, advertising, promotion, record-keeping and reporting of safety and other post-market information. In the United States, the holder of an approved NDA is obligated to monitor and report AEs and any failure of a product to meet the specifications in the NDA. The holder of an approved NDA must also submit new or supplemental applications and obtain FDA approval for certain changes to the approved product, product labeling or manufacturing process. If a REMS is required, the NDA holder may be required to monitor and evaluate those in the healthcare system who are responsible for implementing ETASU measures. Advertising and promotional materials must comply with FDA rules and are subject to FDA review, in addition to other potentially applicable federal and state laws. Moreover, EU and member countries impose strict restrictions on the promotion and marketing of drug products. The off-label promotion of medicinal products is prohibited in the U.S., EU and in other territories. The promotion of medicinal products that are not subject to a marketing authorization is also prohibited in the EU. Violations of the rules governing the promotion of medicinal products in the EU and in other territories could be penalized by administrative measures, fines and imprisonment.\nIn addition, manufacturers of drug products and their facilities are subject to payment of user fees and continual review and periodic inspections by regulatory authorities for compliance with Current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP), and adherence to commitments made in the application. If we, or a regulatory agency, discover previously unknown problems with a product, such as quality issues or AEs of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, a regulatory agency may impose restrictions relative to that product or the manufacturing facility, including requiring recall or withdrawal of the product from the market or suspension of manufacturing.\nIf we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements following approval of any product candidates, a regulatory agency may:\n\u2022issue an untitled or warning letter asserting that we are in violation of the law;\n\u2022seek an injunction or impose civil or criminal penalties or monetary fines;\n\u2022suspend or withdraw regulatory approval;\n\u2022suspend any ongoing clinical trials;\n\u2022refuse to approve a pending application or supplements to an application submitted by us;\n\u2022recall and/or seize product; or\n\u2022refuse to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts.\nAny government investigation of alleged violations of law could require us to expend significant time and resources in response and could generate negative publicity. The occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit our ability to commercialize our product candidates and inhibit our ability to generate revenues.\nObtaining FDA approval for any one of our products in the United States does not mean we will ever obtain approval for or commercialize BCV, ONC201, DSTAT, or any other products outside of the United States, nor does approval of any of our products outside the United States mean we will ever obtain approval for or commercialize any other products inside the United States, all of which could limit our ability to realize their full market potential.\nIn order to market any products outside of the United States, we must establish and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements on a country-by-country basis regarding safety and efficacy. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions. In addition, clinical trials conducted in one country may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other countries, and regulatory approval in one country does not guarantee regulatory approval in any other country. Approval processes vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and validation and additional administrative review periods. Seeking foreign regulatory approval could result in difficulties and costs for us and require additional preclinical studies or clinical trials which could be costly and time consuming. Regulatory requirements can vary widely from country to country and could delay or prevent the introduction of our products in those countries. We do not have any product candidates approved for sale in any jurisdiction, including international markets, and we do not have experience in obtaining regulatory approval in any markets. If we fail to comply with regulatory requirements in international markets or to obtain and maintain required approvals, or if regulatory approvals in international markets are delayed, our target market will be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of our products will be unrealized.\nConversely, approval by regulatory authorities outside the United States, such as the European Commission, does not ensure approval by the FDA. Moreover, clinical trials conducted outside the United States may not be accepted by the FDA.\nCoverage and adequate reimbursement may not be available for our current or any future product candidates, which could make it difficult for us to sell profitably, if approved.\nMarket acceptance and sales of any product candidates that we commercialize, if approved, will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement will be available from third-party payers, including government health administration authorities, managed care organizations and private health insurers. Third-party payers decide which therapies they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. Third-party payers in the United States often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own coverage and reimbursement policies. However, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any product candidates that we develop will be made on a payer-by-payer basis. One payer\u2019s determination to provide coverage for a drug does not assure that other payers will also provide coverage and adequate reimbursement for the drug. Additionally, a third-party payer\u2019s decision to provide coverage for a therapy does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products, therapies and services, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. We cannot be sure that coverage and reimbursement in the United States or elsewhere will be available for any product that we may develop, and any reimbursement that may become available may be decreased or eliminated in the future.\nOur relationships with investigators, health care professionals, consultants, third-party payers, and customers may be subject to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm and diminished profits and future earnings.\nHealthcare providers and others play a primary role in the recommendation and prescribing of any products for which we obtain marketing approval. Our current business operations and future arrangements with investigators, healthcare professionals, consultants, third-party payers and customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations. These laws may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we research, market, sell and distribute our products for which we obtain marketing approval. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022the federal healthcare anti-kickback statute which prohibits, among other things, persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or paying remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease, order or recommendation of, any good, facility, item or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid;\n\u2022the federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the Federal Civil False Claims Act (False Claims Act) which permit private individuals to bring a civil action on behalf of the federal government to enforce certain of these laws thought civil whistleblower or qui tam actions and the Federal Civil Monetary Penalties Act, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment or approval that are false or fraudulent or from knowingly making a false statement to improperly avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;\n\u2022the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) which, among other things, imposes criminal liability for knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payer (e.g., public or private) and knowingly or willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters;\n\u2022HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH), and their implementing regulations impose certain obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information without appropriate authorization by entities subject to the rule, such as health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and certain healthcare providers, and their business associates as well as their covered subcontractors;\n\u2022the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which impose obligations on companies in relation to the handling of personal data of individuals within the EU, along with related national legislation;\n\u2022mandated physician payments reporting laws and/or requirements throughout global jurisdictions, including EU member states, in which we conduct research and development and/or other business activities;\n\u2022the FDCA which prohibits, among other things, the adulteration or misbranding of drugs and devices;\n\u2022the federal transparency law, enacted as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the ACA), and its implementing regulations, which requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals and medical supplies to report to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) information related to payments and other transfers of value made to\nphysicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Beginning in 2022, applicable manufacturers also will be required to report such information regarding its payments and other transfers of value to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, anesthesiologist assistants, certified registered nurse anesthetists and certified nurse midwives during the previous year; and\n\u2022analogous state laws and regulations, including: state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to our business practices, including but not limited to, research, distribution, sales and marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by state governmental and non-governmental third-party payers, including private insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government; state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives; state laws and regulations that require manufacturers to file reports relating to pricing and marketing information, which requires tracking gifts and other remuneration and items of value provided to healthcare professionals and entities; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA.\nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations, agency guidance or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these or any other health regulatory laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and/or divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business. If any of the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we expect to do business are found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they also may be subject to significant criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including, but not limited to, exclusions from government funded healthcare programs, which could also materially affect our business.\nRecently enacted and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for us to obtain marketing approval of and commercialize our product candidates and affect the prices we may obtain.\nIn the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of our product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell any products for which we obtain marketing approval.\nFor example, in March 2010, the ACA was enacted to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for health care and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. The ACA revises the definition of \u201caverage manufacturer price\u201d for reporting purposes, which could increase the amount of Medicaid drug rebates to states. Further, the law imposes a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug products. New provisions affecting compliance have also been enacted, which may affect our business practices with health care practitioners. However, there have been executive, judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. For example, President Trump signed Executive Orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the ACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the ACA. Concurrently, Congress considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, several bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA have been enacted. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Tax Act) repealed, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the \u201cindividual mandate.\u201d In addition, the 2020 federal spending package permanently eliminated, effective January 1, 2020, the ACA-mandated \u201cCadillac\u201d tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage and medical device tax and, effective January 1, 2021, also eliminates the health insurer tax. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, among other things, amended the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, and also increased in the percentage that a drug manufacturer must discount the cost of prescription drugs from 50 percent to 70 percent. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Act. Additionally, on December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld the District Court ruling that the\nindividual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. The U.S. Supreme Court is currently reviewing this case, but it is unknown when a decision will be reached. Although the U.S. Supreme Court has yet ruled on the constitutionality of the ACA, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through May 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructs certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. It is unclear how the Supreme Court ruling, other such litigation, and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact ACA and our business.\nLegislative and regulatory proposals have also been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products.\nAdditionally, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. At the federal level, the Trump administration used several means to propose or implement drug pricing reform, including through federal budget proposals, executive orders and policy initiatives. For example, on July 24, 2020 and September 13, 2020, the Trump administration announced several executive orders related to prescription drug pricing that attempt to implement several of the administration\u2019s proposals. The FDA also released a final rule, effective November 30, 2020, implementing a portion of the importation executive order providing guidance for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. Further, on November 20, 2020, HHS finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The implementation of the rule has been delayed by the Biden administration from January 1, 2022 to January 1, 2023 in response to ongoing litigation. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a new safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers, the implementation of which have also been delayed pending review by the Biden administration until March 22, 2021. On November 20, 2020, CMS issued an interim final rule implementing President Trump\u2019s Most Favored Nation executive order, which would tie Medicare Part B payments for certain physician-administered drugs to the lowest price paid in other economically advanced countries, effective January 1, 2021. On December 28, 2020, the United States District Court in Northern California issued a nationwide preliminary injunction against implementation of the interim final rule. However, it is unclear whether the Biden administration will work to reverse these measures or pursue similar policy initiatives. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Such reform efforts are likely to continue the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medicare program, and may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs.\nHealthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future may result in more rigorous coverage criteria, lower reimbursement, and additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any future approved product. It is possible that additional governmental action may be taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We cannot predict what healthcare reform initiatives may be adopted in the future.\nRisks Related to Our Reliance on Third Parties\nWe rely on third-party manufacturers to produce our preclinical and clinical drug supplies, and we intend to rely on third parties to produce commercial supplies of any approved product candidates.\nWe do not own or operate, and we do not expect to own or operate, facilities for product manufacturing, storage and distribution, or testing with respect to our product candidates, including ONC201, DSTAT or BCV. In the past, we have relied on third-party manufacturers for supply of our preclinical and clinical drug supplies. We expect that in the future we will continue to rely on such manufacturers for drug supply that will be used in clinical trials and for commercialization of any of our product candidates that receive regulatory approval.\nIn July 2019, we were assigned Cantex\u2019s rights under a supply agreement with Scientific Protein Laboratories LLC (SPL) pursuant to which SPL will exclusively produce DSTAT for us through October 2040. We have agreed that SPL will be our exclusive provider of DSTAT bulk drug substance during the term of the agreement.\nOur reliance on third-party manufacturers entails risks, including:\n\u2022inability to meet our product specifications and quality requirements consistently;\n\u2022delay or inability to procure or expand sufficient manufacturing capacity;\n\u2022manufacturing and product quality issues related to scale-up of manufacturing;\n\u2022costs and validation of new equipment and facilities required for scale-up;\n\u2022failure to comply with cGMP and similar foreign standards;\n\u2022inability to negotiate manufacturing agreements with third parties under commercially reasonable terms;\n\u2022termination or nonrenewal of manufacturing agreements with third parties in a manner or at a time that is costly or damaging to us;\n\u2022reliance on a limited number of sources, and in some cases, single sources for product components, such that if we are unable to secure a sufficient supply of these product components, we will be unable to manufacture and sell our product candidates in a timely fashion, in sufficient quantities or under acceptable terms;\n\u2022lack of qualified backup suppliers for those components that are currently purchased from a sole or single source supplier;\n\u2022operations of our third-party manufacturers or suppliers could be disrupted by conditions unrelated to our business or operations, including the bankruptcy of the manufacturer or supplier, or other factors such as the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022carrier disruptions or increased costs that are beyond our control; and\n\u2022failure to deliver our products under specified storage conditions and in a timely manner.\nAny of these events could lead to clinical study delays, failure to obtain regulatory approval or impact our ability to successfully commercialize our products. Some of these events could be the basis for FDA or equivalent foreign regulator action, including injunction, recall, seizure, or total or partial suspension of production. The severity of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic could make access to our existing supply chain difficult or impossible and could materially impact our business.\nWe rely on limited sources of supply for the drug components for each of our product candidates including, BCV, ONC201 and DSTAT, and any disruption in the chain of supply for any of these product candidates may cause delays in their development and commercialization.\nManufacturing of drug components is subject to certain FDA and comparable foreign qualifications with respect to manufacturing standards. We have validated the BCV drug substance manufacturing process at our selected contractor that will produce the commercial supply and possible procurement supply of drug substance. We have selected our BCV commercial and possible procurement tablet and suspension manufacturers and have validated both manufacturing processes. We are currently scaling up the tablet and suspension manufacturing process to meet forecasted procurement demand. There can be no assurance that the manufacturing at commercial scale will be successful or will be completed in a timely fashion. If we are unable to successfully scale up to meet commercial demands our business could be materially harmed.\nWe plan to validate the DSTAT drug substance and drug product processes prior to regulatory approval. It is our expectation that only one supplier of drug substance and one supplier of drug product will be qualified as vendors for both DSTAT and BCV with the FDA. If supply from an approved vendor is interrupted, there could be a significant disruption in commercial supply. An alternative vendor would need to be qualified through an NDA supplement which could result in further delay. The FDA or other regulatory agencies outside of the United States may also require additional studies if a new drug substance or drug product supplier is relied upon for commercial production.\nThese factors could cause the delay of clinical trials, regulatory submissions, required approvals or commercialization of DSTAT and BCV, and cause us to incur additional costs. As an example, we source a significant number of materials used in the manufacture of our products from China; the impact of the recent coronavirus outbreak could make access to our existing supply chain difficult or impossible and could materially harm our business. If our suppliers fail to deliver the required commercial quantities of active pharmaceutical ingredient on a timely basis and at commercially reasonable prices, and we are unable to secure one or more replacement suppliers capable of production at a substantially equivalent cost, our clinical trials for DSTAT and BCV may be delayed, which could inhibit our ability to generate revenues.\nManufacturing issues may arise that could increase product and regulatory approval costs or delay commercialization of BCV, ONC201 and DSTAT.\nWe have validated processes for drug substance and drug product production for BCV.\nWe plan to validate DSTAT drug substance and drug product processes prior to approval at our selected vendors. It is our expectation that only one supplier of drug substance and one supplier of drug product will be qualified as vendors for DSTAT with the FDA.\nAs more batch data is generated post-validation for both the drug substance and drug products, and as additional stability data is collected, issues may arise in our processes and stability programs which could require resolution in order to proceed with our planned clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for the commercial marketing of DSTAT and BCV. In the future, we may identify significant impurities, which could result in increased scrutiny by the regulatory agencies, delays in clinical program and regulatory approval for DSTAT and BCV, increases in our operating expenses, or failure to obtain or maintain approval for either DSTAT, BCV or both.\nWe depend on SymBio for developing and commercializing BCV for human diseases other than orthopoxviruses, including smallpox.\nIn 2019, we entered into a licensing arrangement with SymBio, whereby SymBio is responsible for the future development and commercialization of BCV. Under this arrangement, SymBio is responsible for conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials, obtaining required regulatory approvals for BCV in non-orthopox indications (e.g. smallpox), and manufacturing and commercializing BCV in those indications. Our right to receive milestone payments under the licensing agreement depends on the achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones by SymBio and our ability to receive royalties under the agreement depends on SymBio's successful commercialization of BCV in the licensed indications.\nThe development and commercialization of the non-orthopox uses of BCV in humans and our ability to receive potential milestones and royalty payments under the license agreement with SymBio, would be adversely affected if SymBio:\n\u2022lacks or does not devote sufficient time and resource to the development and commercialization of BCV;\n\u2022lacks or does not devote sufficient capital to fund the development and commercialization of BCV;\n\u2022develops, either alone or with others, products that compete with BCV;\n\u2022fails to gain the requisite regulatory approvals for BCV;\n\u2022does not successfully commercialize BCV;\n\u2022does not conduct its activities in a timely manner;\n\u2022terminates its license with us;\n\u2022does not effectively pursue and enforce intellectual property rights relating to BCV; or\n\u2022merges with a third-party that wants to terminate the collaboration.\nWe have limited or no control over the occurrence of any of the foregoing. Furthermore, disagreements with SymBio could lead to litigation or arbitration, which could be time-consuming and expensive. If any of these issues arise, it may delay the development and commercialization milestones and royalties based on further development and sales of BCV.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct, supervise and monitor our clinical studies and related data, and if those third parties perform in an unsatisfactory manner, it may harm our business.\nWe rely on CROs and clinical trial sites to ensure the proper and timely conduct of our clinical trials. While we have agreements governing their activities, we have limited influence over their actual performance. We have relied and plan to continue to rely upon CROs to monitor and manage data for our ongoing clinical programs for our product candidates, as well as the execution of nonclinical studies. We control only certain aspects of our CROs\u2019 activities. Nevertheless, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our studies is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol, legal, regulatory and scientific standards and our reliance on CROs does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities.\nWe and our CROs are required to comply with the FDA\u2019s guidance for clinical trials conducted within the jurisdiction of the United States (or the foreign regulatory authority equivalent for clinical trials conducted outside the jurisdiction of the United States), which follows the International Council for Harmonization Good Clinical Practice (ICH GCP), which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA for all of our product candidates in clinical development. The FDA enforces the ICH GCP through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and clinical trial sites. If we or our CROs fail to comply with the ICH GCP, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications.\nOur CROs are not our employees, and we cannot control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our ongoing clinical and nonclinical programs. These CROs may also have relationships with other commercial entities, including our competitors, for whom they may also be conducting clinical studies, or other drug development activities which could harm our competitive position. We face the risk of potential unauthorized disclosure or misappropriation of our intellectual property\nby CROs, which may reduce our trade secret protection and allow our potential competitors to access and exploit our proprietary technology.\nIf our CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations, fail to meet expected deadlines, or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for any other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for, or successfully commercialize ONC201, DSTAT, BCV or any other product candidates. Disagreements with our CROs over contractual issues, including performance, compliance or compensation could lead to termination of CRO agreements and/or delays in our clinical program and risks to the accuracy and usability of clinical data. As a result, our financial results and the commercial prospects for our product candidates that we develop would be harmed, our costs could increase, and our ability to generate revenues could be delayed.\nRisks Related to Commercialization of Our Product Candidates\nThe commercial success of BCV, ONC201, DSTAT and any other product candidates will depend upon the acceptance of these products by the medical community, including physicians, patients, pharmacists, health care payers or government procurement agencies (e.g. BARDA).\nIf any of our product candidates receive marketing approval, they may nonetheless not gain sufficient market acceptance by physicians, patients, healthcare payers and others in the medical community. If these products do not achieve an adequate level of market acceptance, we may not generate significant product revenues and we may not become profitable. The degree of market acceptance of any of our product candidates will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022demonstration of clinical safety and efficacy in our clinical trials;\n\u2022relative convenience, ease of administration and acceptance by physicians, patients, pharmacists and health care payers;\n\u2022prevalence and severity of any AEs;\n\u2022limitations or warnings contained in the FDA-approved labeling from Regulatory Authorities such as the FDA and EMA for the relevant product candidate;\n\u2022availability, efficacy and safety of alternative treatments;\n\u2022price and cost-effectiveness;\n\u2022effectiveness of our or any future collaborators\u2019 or competitor\u2019s sales and marketing strategies;\n\u2022ability to obtain hospital formulary approval;\n\u2022ability to ensure availability for product through appropriate channels;\n\u2022ability to maintain adequate inventory; and\n\u2022ability to obtain and maintain sufficient third-party coverage and adequate reimbursement, which may vary from country to country.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approval, the granting authority may still impose significant restrictions on the indicated uses, distribution or marketing of our product candidates, including ONC201, DSTAT and BCV, or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post-approval studies or post-market surveillance. For example, the labeling ultimately approved for our product candidates, will likely include restrictions on use due to the specific patient population and manner of use in which the drug was evaluated and the safety and efficacy data obtained in those evaluations. In addition, the distribution of ONC201, DSTAT or BCV may be tightly controlled through a REMS with ETASU, which are required medical interventions or other actions healthcare professionals need to execute prior to prescribing or dispensing the drug to the patient. Some actions may also be required in order for the patient to continue on treatment. For example, the label for BCV may be required to include a boxed warning, or \u201cblack box,\u201d regarding BCV being carcinogenic, teratogenic and impairing fertility in animal studies. The BCV labeling may also include warnings pertaining to gastrointestinal AEs or liver-related safety laboratory value changes or black boxes related to the mortality disadvantage with extended dosing observed in the SUPPRESS trial.\nIf we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell our product candidates, we may be unable to generate any revenue.\nWe currently do not have an organization for the sales and distribution of pharmaceutical products. The cost of establishing and maintaining such an organization may exceed the cost-effectiveness of doing so. In order to market any products that may be approved we must establish our sales, marketing, managerial and other non-technical capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services. We may enter into strategic partnerships with third parties to commercialize our product candidates.\nOur strategy for each of ONC201 and DSTAT, is to establish a specialty sales force and/or collaborate with third parties to promote the product to healthcare professionals and third-party payers in the United States and elsewhere. We may elect to launch with a contract sales organization and utilize accompanying commercial support services provided by a contract sales organization. Our future collaboration partners, if any, may not dedicate sufficient resources to the commercialization of our product candidates or may otherwise fail in their commercialization due to factors beyond our control. If we are unable to establish effective collaborations to enable the distribution and sale of our product candidates to healthcare professionals and in geographical regions, including the United States, that are not covered by our own marketing and sales force, or if our potential future collaboration partners do not successfully commercialize our product candidates, our ability to generate revenues from product sales, including sales of ONC201 and DSTAT, will be adversely affected.\nEstablishing an internal or contract sales force involves many challenges, including:\n\u2022recruiting and retaining talented people;\n\u2022training employees that we recruit;\n\u2022establishing compliance standards;\n\u2022setting the appropriate system of incentives;\n\u2022managing additional headcount;\n\u2022ensuring that appropriate support functions are in place to support sales force organizational needs; and\n\u2022integrating a new business unit into an existing corporate architecture.\nIf we are unable to establish our own sales force or negotiate a strategic partnership for the commercialization of our product candidates in any markets, we may be forced to delay the potential commercialization of our product candidates in those markets, reduce the scope of our sales or marketing activities for our product candidates in those markets or undertake the commercialization activities for BCV, ONC201 and DSTAT in those markets at our own expense. If we elect to increase our expenditures to fund commercialization activities ourselves, we will need to obtain additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we do not have sufficient funds, we will not be able to bring our product candidates to market or generate product revenue. Limited or lack of funding will impede our ability to achieve successful commercialization.\nIf we are unable to establish adequate sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, whether independently or with third parties, we may not be able to generate sufficient product revenue and may not become profitable. We will be competing with many companies that currently have extensive and well-funded marketing and sales operations. Without an internal team or the support of a third party to perform marketing and sales functions, we may be unable to compete successfully against these more established companies.\nIn addition, there are risks involved with both establishing our own sales and marketing capabilities and entering into arrangements with third parties to perform these services. For example, recruiting and training a sales force is expensive and time-consuming and could delay any product launch. If the commercial launch of a product candidate for which we recruit a sales force and establish marketing capabilities is delayed or does not occur for any reason, we would have prematurely or unnecessarily incurred these commercialization expenses. This may be costly, and our investment would be lost if we cannot retain or reposition our sales, marketing and market access personnel.\nIf we obtain approval to commercialize any products outside of the United States, a variety of risks associated with international operations could materially adversely affect our business.\nIf our product candidates are approved for commercialization, we may enter into agreements with third parties to market those product candidates outside the United States. We expect that we will be subject to additional risks related to entering into international business relationships, including:\n\u2022different regulatory requirements for drug approvals in the EU and other foreign countries;\n\u2022reduced protection for intellectual property rights;\n\u2022unexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers and regulatory and labor requirements;\n\u2022economic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets;\n\u2022compliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad;\n\u2022foreign taxes, including withholding of payroll taxes;\n\u2022foreign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenues, and other obligations incident to doing business in another country;\n\u2022differing payer reimbursement regimes, governmental payers or patient self-pay systems and price controls;\n\u2022workforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States;\n\u2022production shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad;\n\u2022regulatory risks associated with cross-border transportation of animal-sourced material;\n\u2022business interruptions resulting from geopolitical actions, including war and terrorism, or natural disasters and other events outside our control including epidemics, pandemics, earthquakes, typhoons, floods and fires; and\n\u2022regulatory and compliance risks that relate to maintaining accurate information and control over activities that may fall within the purview of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, its books and records provisions or its anti-bribery provisions, or similar anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws and regulations.\nWe have limited experience in these areas. In addition, there are complex regulatory, tax, labor and other legal requirements imposed by both the EU and many of the individual countries in Europe with which we will need to comply. Many U.S.-based biopharmaceutical companies have found the process of marketing their own products outside the United States to be very challenging.\nWe face competition from other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies and our operating results will suffer if we fail to compete effectively.\nThe biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive. We have competitors both in the United States and internationally, including major multinational pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies and universities and other research institutions.\nMany of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, commercial and other resources, such as larger research and development staff, stronger intellectual property portfolios and experienced marketing and manufacturing organizations and established sales forces. Additional mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated in our competitors.\nCompetition may increase further as a result of advances in the commercial applicability of technologies and greater availability of capital for investment in these industries. Our competitors may succeed in developing, acquiring or licensing, on an exclusive basis, drug products that are more effective or less costly than BCV, ONC201 and DSTAT or any other drug candidate that we are currently developing or that we may develop.\nWe will face competition from other drugs currently approved or that will be approved in the future for the same indications. Therefore, our ability to compete successfully will depend largely on our ability to:\n\u2022discover and develop medicines that are superior to other products in the market;\n\u2022demonstrate through our clinical trials that our product candidates, including BCV, ONC201 and DSTAT, are differentiated from existing and future therapies;\n\u2022attract qualified scientific, product development and commercial personnel;\n\u2022obtain and successfully defend and enforce patent and/or other proprietary protection for our medicines and technologies;\n\u2022obtain required regulatory approvals;\n\u2022successfully collaborate with pharmaceutical companies in the discovery, development and commercialization of new medicines;\n\u2022deliver a competitive value proposition compared to established competition and/or competitors who will enter the market before or after any of our product candidates, including BCV, ONC201 and DSTAT; and\n\u2022negotiate competitive pricing and reimbursement with third-party payers.\nThe availability of our competitors\u2019 products could affect the price we are able to charge, for any product candidate we develop. The inability to compete with existing or subsequently introduced drug products would have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and prospects.\nEstablished pharmaceutical companies may invest heavily to accelerate discovery and development of novel compounds or to in-license novel compounds that could make our product candidates less competitive. In addition, any new product that competes with an approved product must demonstrate compelling advantages in efficacy, convenience, tolerability and safety in order to overcome price competition and to be commercially successful. Accordingly, our competitors may succeed in obtaining patent protection, receiving FDA approval or discovering, developing and commercializing medicines before we do, which would have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe may expend our limited resources to pursue a particular product candidate or indication and fail to capitalize on product candidates or indications that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nThe success of our business depends primarily upon our ability to identify, develop and commercialize product candidates. Because we have limited financial and managerial resources, we focus on research programs and product candidates for specific indications. As a result, we may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with other product candidates or other indications that later prove to have greater commercial potential.\nOur research programs may initially show promise in identifying potential product candidates, yet fail to yield product candidates for clinical development for a number of reasons, including:\n\u2022our research methodology or that of our collaboration partners may be unsuccessful in identifying potential product candidates;\n\u2022our potential product candidates may be shown to have harmful side effects or may have other characteristics that may make the products unmarketable or unlikely to receive marketing approval; and\n\u2022our collaboration partners may change their development profiles for potential product candidates or abandon a therapeutic area.\nIf any of these events occur, we may be forced to abandon our development efforts for a program or programs, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and could potentially cause us to cease operations. Research programs to identify new product candidates require substantial technical, financial and human resources. We may focus our research efforts and resources on potential programs or product candidates that ultimately prove to be unsuccessful.\nIf we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through collaboration, licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to obtain or protect intellectual property rights related to our products and product candidates, we may not be able to compete effectively in our market.\nWe rely upon a combination of patents, trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect the intellectual property related to our products and product candidates. The strength of patents in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical field involves complex legal and scientific questions and can be uncertain. The patent applications that we own or in-license may fail to result in issued patents with claims that cover the products in the United States or in other countries. If this were to occur, early generic competition could be expected against any product candidates we may develop. There is no assurance that all of the potentially relevant prior art relating to our patents and patent applications has been found, which can invalidate a patent or prevent a patent from issuing based on a pending patent application. Even if patents do successfully issue, third parties may challenge their validity, enforceability, scope or ownership, which may result in such patents, or our rights to such patents, being narrowed or invalidated.\nFurthermore, even if they are unchallenged, our patents and patent applications may not adequately protect our intellectual property or prevent others from designing around our claims. If the patent applications we hold or license with respect to any of our product candidates fails to issue or if their breadth or strength of protection is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to develop, and threaten our ability to commercialize, our products. We cannot offer any assurances about which, if any, patents will issue or whether any issued patents will be found not invalid and not unenforceable, will go unthreatened by third parties or will adequately protect our products and product candidates. Further, if we encounter delays in regulatory approvals, the period of time during which we could market DSTAT and BCV under patent protection could be reduced. Since patent applications in the United States and most other countries are confidential for a period of time after filing, and some remain so until issued, we cannot be certain that we or our licensors were the first to file any patent application related to any of our product candidates. Furthermore, if third parties have filed such patent applications, an interference proceeding in the United States can be provoked by a third party or instituted by us to determine who was the first to invent any of the subject matter covered by the patent claims of our applications. An unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to license it from the prevailing party, which may not be possible. In addition to the protection afforded by patents, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect proprietary know-how that is not patentable, processes for which patents are difficult to enforce and other elements of our drug discovery and development processes that involve proprietary know-how, information or technology that is not covered by patents. Although we expect all of our employees to assign their inventions to us, and all of our employees, consultants, advisors and any third parties who have access to our proprietary know-how, information or technology to enter into confidentiality agreements, we\ncannot provide any assurances that all such agreements have been duly executed, that such agreements provide adequate protection and will not be breached, that our trade secrets and other confidential proprietary information will not otherwise be disclosed or that competitors will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques. If we are unable to prevent material disclosure of the non-patented intellectual property related to our technologies to third parties, and there is no guarantee that we will have any such enforceable trade secret protection, we may not be able to establish or maintain a competitive advantage in our market, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFurther, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect patents and other proprietary rights to the same extent or in the same manner as the laws of the United States. As a result, we may encounter significant problems in protecting and defending our intellectual property abroad. We may also fail to pursue or obtain patents and other intellectual property protection relating to our products and product candidates in all foreign countries.\nFinally, certain of our activities and our licensors\u2019 activities have been funded, and may in the future be funded, by the U.S. federal government. When new technologies are developed with U.S. federal government funding, the government obtains certain rights in any resulting patents, including a nonexclusive license authorizing the government to use the invention for non-commercial purposes. These rights may permit the government to disclose our confidential information to third parties and to exercise \u201cmarch-in\u201d rights to use or allow third parties to use our patented technology. The government can exercise its march-in rights if it determines that action is necessary because we fail to achieve practical application of the U.S. government-funded technology, because action is necessary to alleviate health or safety needs, to meet requirements of federal regulations or to give preference to U.S. industry. In addition, U.S. government-funded inventions must be reported to the government, U.S. government funding must be disclosed in any resulting patent applications, and our rights in such inventions may be subject to certain requirements to manufacture products in the United States.\nThird-party claims of intellectual property infringement may prevent or delay our development and commercialization efforts or otherwise affect our business.\nOur commercial success depends in part on our avoiding infringement and other violations of the patents and proprietary rights of third parties. There is a substantial amount of litigation, both within and outside the United States, involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including patent infringement lawsuits, interferences, oppositions and inter party reexamination proceedings before the United States Patent and Trademark Office (U.S. PTO) and its foreign counterparts. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields in which we and our collaborators are developing product candidates. As the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are issued, and as we gain greater visibility and market exposure as a public company, the risk increases that our product candidates or other business activities may be subject to claims of infringement of the patent and other proprietary rights of third parties. Third parties may assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization. There may be third-party patents or patent applications with claims to materials, formulations, methods of manufacture or methods for treatment related to the use or manufacture of ONC201, DSTAT, BCV and/or any other product candidates. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending patent applications which may later result in issued patents that our product candidates may infringe. In addition, third parties may obtain patents in the future and claim that use of our technologies infringes upon these patents. If any third-party patents were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover the manufacturing process of any of our product candidates, any molecules formed during the manufacturing process or any final product itself, the holders of any such patents may be able to block our ability to commercialize such product candidate unless we obtained a license under the applicable patents, or until such patents expire.\nSimilarly, if any third-party patent were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover aspects of our formulations, processes for manufacture or methods of use, including combination therapy, the holders of any such patent may be able to block our ability to develop and commercialize the applicable product candidate unless we obtained a license or until such patent expires. In either case, such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. In addition, we may be subject to claims that we are infringing other intellectual property rights, such as trademarks or copyrights, or misappropriating the trade secrets of others, and to the extent that our employees, consultants or contractors use intellectual property or proprietary information owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.\nParties making claims against us may obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to further develop and commercialize one or more of our product candidates. Defense of these claims, regardless of their merit, would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of employee resources from our business. In the event of a successful infringement or other intellectual property claim against us, we may have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees for willful infringement, obtain one or more licenses from third parties, pay\nroyalties or redesign our affected products, which may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure. We cannot predict whether any such license would be available at all or whether it would be available on commercially reasonable terms. Furthermore, even in the absence of litigation, we may need to obtain licenses from third parties to advance our research or allow commercialization of our product candidates, and we have done so from time to time. We may fail to obtain any of these licenses at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms, if at all. In that event, we would be unable to further develop and commercialize one or more of our product candidates, which could harm our business significantly. We cannot provide any assurances that third-party patents do not exist which might be enforced against our products or product candidates, resulting in either an injunction prohibiting our sales, or, with respect to our sales, an obligation on our part to pay royalties and/or other forms of compensation to third parties.\nWe may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents, the patents of our licensors and licensees or our other intellectual property rights, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe or otherwise violate our patents, the patents of our licensors or our other intellectual property rights. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file legal claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours or our licensors is not valid or is unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing. The initiation of a claim against a third party may also cause the third party to bring counterclaims against us.\nWe may not be able to prevent, alone or with our licensors, misappropriation of our intellectual property rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the United States. Our business could be harmed if in a litigation the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms. Any litigation or other proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights may fail, and even if successful, may result in substantial costs and distract our management and other employees.\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nPeriodic maintenance fees on any issued patent are due to be paid to the U.S. PTO and foreign patent agencies in several stages over the lifetime of the patent. The U.S. PTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process.\nWhile an inadvertent lapse can in many cases be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. Non-compliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application include, but are not limited to, failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time limits, non-payment of fees and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents. If we or our licensors that control the prosecution and maintenance of our licensed patents fail to maintain the patents and patent applications covering our product candidates, we may lose our rights and our competitors might be able to enter the market, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to Our United States Government Contracts and Grants\nThere can be no assurances that we will be able to enter into a contract with BARDA to act as the sole supplier for the procurement of BCV for the treatment of smallpox.\nIn April 2015, BARDA posted a notice of intent to use other than full and open competition to award a sole source contract to us for the procurement of BCV for the treatment of smallpox. In May 2015, BARDA posted an approved justification for the use of other than full and open competition for the contract. In July 2015, BARDA issued a RFP entitled \u201c2015 Procurement of a Second Smallpox Antiviral Drug for the Strategic National Stockpile.\u201d In August 2015, we submitted a response to the RFP\nand we subsequently engaged in discussions with BARDA regarding our response. The issuance of that RFP did not culminate with agreement for the sole source supply of BCV for the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS).\nWe remain in discussions with BARDA regarding the potential to supply BCV to the SNS, however, there can be no assurances that a future RFP for BCV procurement will be issued.\nFurthermore, in the event that BARDA issues an RFP for procurement of a smallpox antiviral therapeutic, there can be no assurance that we would reach agreement with BARDA on terms related to the manufacture and delivery of BCV to the SNS. Among the material terms to be negotiated and agreed to are: price, volume, and payment and delivery schedules, as we currently do not have BCV commercial product in inventory that would be available for immediate delivery.\nUnfavorable provisions in government contracts, including our contract with BARDA, may harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nUnited States government contracts typically contain unfavorable provisions and are subject to audit and modification by the government at its sole discretion, which will subject us to additional risks. For example, under our contract with BARDA, the U.S. government has the power to unilaterally:\n\u2022audit and object to any BARDA contract-related costs and fees on grounds that they are not allowable under the FAR, and require us to reimburse all such costs and fees;\n\u2022suspend or prevent us for a set period of time from receiving new contracts or extending our existing contract based on violations or suspected violations of laws or regulations;\n\u2022claim nonexclusive, nontransferable rights to product manufactured and intellectual property developed under the BARDA contract and may, under certain circumstances, such as circumstances involving public health and safety, license such inventions to third parties without our consent;\n\u2022cancel, terminate or suspend our BARDA contract based on violations or suspected violations of laws or regulations;\n\u2022terminate our BARDA contract in whole or in part for the convenience of the government for any reason or no reason, including if funds become unavailable to the applicable governmental agency;\n\u2022reduce the scope and value of our BARDA contract;\n\u2022decline to exercise an option to continue the BARDA contract;\n\u2022direct the course of a development program in a manner not chosen by the government contractor;\n\u2022require us to perform the option segments even if doing so may cause us to forego or delay the pursuit of other opportunities with greater commercial potential;\n\u2022take actions that result in a longer development timeline than expected; and\n\u2022change certain terms and conditions in our BARDA contract.\nThe U.S. government also has the right to terminate the BARDA contract if termination is in the government\u2019s interest, or if we default by failing to perform in accordance with the milestones set forth in the contract. Termination-for-convenience provisions generally enable us to recover only our costs incurred or committed (plus a portion of the agreed fee) and settlement expenses on the work completed prior to termination. Except for the amount of services received by the government, termination-for-default provisions do not permit recovery of fees.\nIn addition, we must comply with numerous laws and regulations that affect how we conduct business with the United States government. Among the most significant government contracting regulations that affect our business are:\n\u2022FAR, and agency-specific regulations supplements to the FAR, which comprehensively regulate the procurement, formation, administration and performance of government contracts and implement federal procurement policy in numerous areas, such as employment practices, protection of the environment, accuracy and retention periods of records, recording and charging of costs, treatment of laboratory animals and human subject research;\n\u2022business ethics and public integrity obligations, which govern conflicts of interest and the hiring of former government employees, restrict the granting of gratuities and funding of lobbying activities and incorporate other requirements such as the Anti-Kickback Act and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;\n\u2022export and import control laws and regulations; and\n\u2022laws, regulations and executive orders restricting the use and dissemination of information classified for national security purposes and the exportation of certain products and technical data.\nFurthermore, we may be required to enter into agreements and subcontracts with third parties, including suppliers, consultants and other third-party contractors, in order to satisfy our contractual obligations pursuant to our agreements with the U.S. government. Negotiating and entering into such arrangements can be time-consuming and we may not be able to reach\nagreement with such third parties. Any such agreement must also be compliant with the terms of our government contract. Any delay or inability to enter into such arrangements or entering into such arrangements in a manner that is non-compliant with the terms of our contract, may result in violations of our contract.\nAs a result of these unfavorable provisions, we must undertake significant compliance activities. The diversion of resources from commercial programs to these compliance activities, as well as the exercise by the U.S. government of any rights under these provisions, could materially harm our business.\nOur business is subject to audit by the U.S. government, including under our contract with BARDA, and a negative audit could adversely affect our business.\nUnited States government agencies, such as the DHHS, routinely audit and investigate government contractors and recipients of federal grants, including our contract with BARDA. These agencies review a contractor\u2019s performance under its contracts, cost structure and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards.\nThe DHHS can also review the adequacy of, and a contractor\u2019s compliance with, its internal control systems and policies, including the contractor\u2019s purchasing, property, estimating, compensation and management information systems. Any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed, while such costs already reimbursed must be refunded. If an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including:\n\u2022termination of contracts;\n\u2022forfeiture of profits;\n\u2022suspension of payments;\n\u2022fines; and\n\u2022suspension or prohibition from conducting business with the U.S. government.\nIn addition, we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us by the U.S. government, which could adversely affect our business.\nAgreements with government agencies may lead to claims against us under the Federal False Claims Act, and these claims could result in substantial fines and other penalties.\nThe biopharmaceutical industry is, and in recent years has been, under heightened scrutiny as the subject of government investigations and enforcement actions. Our BARDA contract is subject to substantial financial penalties under the Federal Civil Monetary Penalties Act and the False Claims Act. The False Claims Act imposes liability on any person who, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim paid or approved by the government. Under the False Claims Act\u2019s \u201cwhistleblower\u201d provisions, private enforcement of fraud claims against businesses on behalf of the U.S. government has increased due in part to amendments to the False Claims Act that encourage private individuals to sue on behalf of the government. These whistleblower suits, known as qui tam actions, may be filed by private individuals, including present and former employees. The False Claims Act provides for treble damages and significant civil monetary penalties per false claim. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws, or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Any penalties, damages, fines, exclusions, curtailment, or restructuring of our operations could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations and Industry\nIncreasing demand for compassionate use of our unapproved therapies could result in losses.\nRecent media attention to individual patients' expanded access requests has resulted in the introduction of legislation at the local and national level referred to as \"Right to Try\" laws, such as the Right to Try Act, which are intended to give patients access to unapproved therapies. New and emerging legislation regarding expanded access to unapproved drugs for life-threatening illnesses could negatively impact our business in the future. In addition, during 2014, we were the target of an active and disruptive social media campaign related to a request for access to BCV. If we experience similar social media campaigns in the future, we may experience significant disruption to our business which could result in losses.\nA possible consequence of both activism and legislation in this area is the need for us to initiate an unanticipated expanded access program or to make ONC201, DSTAT or BCV more widely available sooner than anticipated. We are a small company with limited resources and unanticipated trials or access programs could result in diversion of resources from our primary goals.\nIn addition, patients who receive access to unapproved drugs through compassionate use or expanded access programs have life-threatening illnesses and have exhausted all other available therapies. The risk for serious adverse events in this patient population is high which could have a negative impact on the safety profile of our product candidates, which could cause significant delays or an inability to successfully commercialize them, which could materially harm our business. We may also need to restructure or pause ongoing compassionate use and/or expanded access programs in order to perform the controlled clinical trials required for regulatory approval and successful commercialization of our product candidates, which could prompt adverse publicity or other disruptions related to current or potential participants in such programs. The BCV compassionate use program ended in the third quarter of 2020.\nIf we fail to comply with the extensive legal and regulatory requirements affecting the health care industry, we could face increased costs, delays in the development of our product candidates, penalties and a loss of business.\nOur activities, and the activities of our collaborators, partners and third-party providers, are subject to extensive government regulation and oversight both in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. The FDA and comparable agencies in other jurisdictions directly regulate many of our most critical business activities, including the conduct of preclinical and clinical studies, product manufacturing, advertising and promotion, product distribution, adverse event reporting and product risk management. States increasingly have been placing greater restrictions on the marketing practices of healthcare companies. In addition, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have been the target of lawsuits and investigations alleging violations of government regulations, including claims asserting submission of incorrect pricing information, impermissible off-label promotion of pharmaceutical products, payments intended to influence the referral of federal or state healthcare business, submission of false claims for government reimbursement, antitrust violations, violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or violations related to environmental matters. Violations of governmental regulation may be punishable by criminal, civil and administrative sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. In addition to penalties for violation of laws and regulations, we could be required to delay or terminate the development of our product candidates, or we could be required to repay amounts we received from government payers, or pay additional rebates and interest if we are found to have miscalculated the pricing information we have submitted to the government. Whether or not we have complied with the law, an investigation into alleged unlawful conduct could increase our expenses, damage our reputation, divert management time and attention and adversely affect our business.\nOur future success depends on our ability to retain key executives and to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.\nWe are highly dependent on the principal members of our executive team. While we have entered into employment agreements or offer letters with each of our executive officers, any of them could leave our employment at any time, as all of our employees are \u201cat will\u201d employees. To help attract, retain, and motivate qualified employees, we use share-based incentive awards such as employee stock options and restricted stock units. Due to the decline in our stock price that has occurred since December 2015, a large percentage of the options held by our employees are underwater. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 21% of all outstanding options had an exercise price above the closing price of the stock on that date. As a result, the current situation provides a considerable challenge to maintaining employee motivation, as well as creating a serious threat to retention until a recovery commences. If our share-based compensation ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit, our ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees could be weakened, which could harm our results of operations.\nWe do not maintain \u201ckey person\u201d insurance for any of our executives or other employees. Recruiting and retaining other qualified employees for our business, including scientific and technical personnel, will also be critical to our success. There is currently a shortage of appropriately skilled executives in our industry, which is likely to continue. We also experience competition for the hiring of scientific and clinical personnel from universities and research institutions. As a result, competition for skilled personnel is intense and the turnover rate can be high. We may not be able to attract and retain personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for similar personnel. In addition, failure of any of our clinical studies may make it more challenging to recruit and retain qualified personnel. The inability to recruit or loss of the services of any executive or key employee may adversely affect the progress of our research, development and commercialization objectives.\nIn addition, we rely on consultants and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, to assist us in formulating our research and development and commercialization strategy. Our consultants and advisors may be employed by employers other than us and may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit their availability to us, which could also adversely affect the progress of our research, development and commercialization objectives.\nPotential product liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to limit commercialization of any products that we may develop.\nThe use of our product candidates, including BCV, ONC201 and DSTAT, in clinical studies and the sale of any products for which we obtain marketing approval exposes us to the risk of product liability claims. Product liability claims might be brought against us by consumers, health care providers, pharmaceutical companies or others selling or otherwise coming into contact with our products. On occasion, large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on drugs that had unanticipated adverse effects. If we cannot successfully defend against product liability claims, we could incur substantial liability and costs. In addition, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in:\n\u2022impairment of our business reputation and significant negative media attention;\n\u2022withdrawal of participants from our clinical studies;\n\u2022significant costs to defend the related litigation;\n\u2022distraction of management\u2019s attention from our primary business;\n\u2022substantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants;\n\u2022inability to commercialize our product candidates, including BCV, ONC201 and DSTAT; and\n\u2022decreased demand for our product candidates, if approved for commercial sale.\nWe currently carry $15 million in product liability insurance covering our clinical trials. Our current product liability insurance coverage may not be sufficient to reimburse us for any expenses or losses we may suffer. Moreover, insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive and in the future we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability. If and when we obtain marketing approval for our product candidates, we intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products; however, we may be unable to obtain product liability insurance on commercially reasonable terms or in adequate amounts. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could cause our stock price to decline and, if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could adversely affect our results of operations and business.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, which began in late 2019 and has spread worldwide, may affect our ability to initiate or continue our planned, ongoing and future clinical trials, disrupt regulatory activities, disrupt our ability to maintain a commercial infrastructure for our products or have other adverse effects on our business and operations. In addition, this pandemic has caused substantial disruption in the financial markets and may adversely impact economies worldwide, both of which could result in adverse effects on our business and operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, which began in December 2019, has spread worldwide, causing many governments to implement measures to slow the spread of the outbreak through quarantines, strict travel restrictions, heightened border scrutiny, and other measures. The outbreak and government measures taken in response have also had a significant impact, both direct and indirect, on businesses and commerce, as worker shortages have occurred; supply chains have been disrupted; facilities and production have been suspended; and demand for certain goods and services, such as medical services and supplies, has spiked, while demand for other goods and services, such as travel, has fallen. The future progression of the pandemic and its effects on our business and operations are uncertain.\nIn the event of a continuation of shelter-in-place orders and/or other mandated local travel restrictions, our employees conducting research and development activities may not be able to access our research space, and our core activities may be significantly limited or curtailed, possibly for an extended period of time. In light of the pandemic, we may choose to pause certain research programs, delay the start of certain longer-term clinical studies and limit hiring.\nWe may face difficulties recruiting or retaining patients in our ongoing clinical trials because of the pandemic. For example, patients for our recently initiated trial of DSTAT as a treatment for AML may be unable or unwilling to visit clinical trial sites which may impact the collection of important clinical trial data or such a delay may alter DSTAT's potential time to market which could reduce its commercial attractiveness in a competitive AML marketplace. In addition, limitations in the ability to visit sites may adversely affect, our enrollment timelines for our clinical trials, and may adversely affect the timing of completion of our clinical trials or our ability to complete clinical trials in a fully compliant manner. Additionally, the potential suspension of clinical trial activity at clinical trial sites may have an adverse impact on our clinical trial plans and timelines.\nWe may face disruptions that may affect our ability to initiate and complete clinical trials including disruptions in procuring items that are essential for our research and development activities, including, for example, raw materials used in the manufacturing of our product candidates and laboratory supplies for planned and ongoing clinical trials, in each case, for which there may be shortages because of ongoing efforts to address the outbreak. Site initiation, participant recruitment and enrollment, participant dosing, distribution of clinical trial materials, study monitoring and data analysis may be paused or delayed due to changes in hospital or university policies, federal, state or local regulations, prioritization of hospital resources\ntoward pandemic efforts, or other reasons related to the pandemic. We may face manufacturing disruptions or disruptions related to the ability to obtain necessary institutional review board, or IRB, or other necessary site approvals, as well as other delays at clinical trial sites.\nThe response to the COVID-19 pandemic may redirect resources with respect to regulatory and intellectual property matters in a way that would adversely impact our ability to progress regulatory approvals and protect our intellectual property. In addition, we may face impediments to regulatory meetings and approvals due to measures intended to limit in-person interactions.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has already caused significant disruptions in the financial markets, and may continue to cause such disruptions, which could impact our ability to raise additional funds through public offerings and may also impact the volatility of our stock price and trading in our stock. Moreover, it is possible the pandemic will significantly impact economies worldwide, which could result in adverse effects on our business and operations. We cannot be certain what the overall impact of the COVID-19 pandemic will be on our business and it has the potential to adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nWe may experience difficulties in integrating the operations of Oncoceutics into our business and in realizing the expected benefits of the merger with Oncoceutics.\nThe success of our merger with Oncoceutics (the Merger) will depend in part on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from combining the operations of Oncoceutics with our business in an efficient and effective manner. The integration process could take longer than anticipated and could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of each company\u2019s ongoing businesses, tax costs or inefficiencies, or inconsistencies in standards, controls, information technology systems, procedures and policies, any of which could adversely affect our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the Merger, and could harm our financial performance and impair stockholder value. If we are unable to successfully or timely integrate the operations of Oncoceutics with our business, we may incur unanticipated liabilities and be unable to realize the revenue growth, synergies and other anticipated benefits resulting from the Merger, and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. We have incurred significant costs in connection with the Merger. The substantial majority of these costs are non-recurring expenses related to the Merger. We may incur additional costs in the integration of Oncoceutics, and may not achieve cost synergies and other benefits sufficient to offset the incremental costs of the Merger.\nRisks Related To Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock is likely to be volatile, and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above your purchase price.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been volatile, and is likely to continue to be volatile for the foreseeable future. Our stock price is subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors, including the following:\n\u2022results of clinical trials of our product candidates or those of our competitors;\n\u2022any delay in filing an application for any of our product candidates and any adverse development or perceived adverse development with respect to regulatory review of that application;\n\u2022failure to successfully develop and commercialize our product candidates, including BCV, ONC201 and DSTAT;\n\u2022termination of any of our license or collaboration agreements;\n\u2022any agency or judicial enforcement actions against us;\n\u2022inability to obtain additional funding;\n\u2022regulatory or legal developments in the United States and other countries applicable to our product candidates;\n\u2022adverse regulatory decisions;\n\u2022changes in the structure of healthcare payment systems;\n\u2022inability to obtain adequate product supply for our product candidates, or the inability to do so at acceptable prices;\n\u2022introduction of new products, services or technologies by our competitors;\n\u2022failure to meet or exceed financial projections we provide to the public;\n\u2022failure to meet or exceed the estimates and projections of the investment community;\n\u2022changes in the market valuations of similar companies;\n\u2022market conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors, and the issuance of new or changed securities analysts\u2019 reports or recommendations;\n\u2022announcements of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by us or our competitors;\n\u2022significant lawsuits (including patent or stockholder litigation), and disputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights (including patents, litigation matters and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies);\n\u2022additions or departures of key scientific or management personnel;\n\u2022sales of our common stock by us or our stockholders in the future;\n\u2022trading volume of our common stock;\n\u2022general economic, industry and market conditions, including the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic; and\n\u2022the other factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and The Nasdaq Global Market in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nOur principal stockholders and management own a significant percentage of our stock and will be able to exert significant control over matters subject to stockholder approval.\nBased upon shares of common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2020, our then executive officers, directors, 5% stockholders (known to us through available information) and their affiliates beneficially owned approximately 37.2% of our voting stock. Therefore, these stockholders have the ability to substantially influence us through this ownership position. For example, these stockholders, if they choose to act together, may be able to influence the election of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, or approval of any merger, sale of assets, or other major corporate transaction. This concentration of voting power could delay or prevent an acquisition of our company on terms that other stockholders may desire.\nFailure to establish and maintain adequate finance infrastructure and accounting systems and controls could impair our ability to comply with the financial reporting and internal controls requirements for publicly traded companies.\nAs a public company, we operate in an increasingly demanding regulatory environment, which requires us to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and the related rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, expanded disclosure requirements, accelerated reporting requirements and more complex accounting rules. Company responsibilities required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act include establishing and maintaining corporate oversight and adequate internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to help prevent financial fraud.\nOur compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act has required and will continue to require that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management efforts. In this or future years, our testing, or the subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm, may reveal deficiencies in our internal controls that we would be required to remediate in a timely manner so as to be able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act each year. If we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in a timely manner each year, we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission, The Nasdaq Stock Market or other regulatory authorities which would require additional financial and management resources and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Furthermore, if we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our business and results of operations could be harmed and investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information.\nFuture sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase common stock, including pursuant to our equity incentive plans, could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to fall.\nWe expect that significant additional capital will be needed in the future to continue our planned operations. To the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution. We may sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time. If we sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in more than one transaction, investors may be materially diluted by subsequent sales. Such sales may also result in material dilution to our existing stockholders, and new investors could gain rights superior to our existing stockholders.\nIn July 2019, we entered into a license agreement with Cantex where we acquired an exclusive license to global development and commercialization rights to DSTAT. As partial consideration for our rights under the license agreement, we issued to Cantex 10,000,000 shares of our common stock. We are continuing to review additional potential transactions to add to our pipeline of product candidates, and these transactions could involve the issuance of additional shares of common stock or other\nequity securities. On January 7, 2021, we acquired Oncoceutics, a privately-held, clinical-stage biotechnology company developing imipridones, including ONC201. As part of the consideration for the acquisition, we paid an upfront cash payment of approximately $25.0 million and issued an aggregate of 8,723,769 shares of our common stock.\nPursuant to our 2013 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2013 Plan), our management is authorized to grant stock options to our employees, directors and consultants. The number of shares available for future grant under our 2013 Plan will automatically increase on January 1st each year, through January 1, 2023, by an amount equal to 4.0% of all shares of our capital stock outstanding as of December 31st of the preceding calendar year, subject to the ability of our board of directors to take action to reduce the size of such increase in any given year. In addition, our board of directors may grant or provide for the grant of rights to purchase shares of our common stock pursuant to the terms of our 2013 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP). The number of shares of our common stock reserved for issuance under our ESPP will automatically increase on January 1st each year, through January 1, 2023, by an amount equal to the lesser of 422,535 shares or one percent of all shares of our capital stock outstanding as of December 31st of the preceding calendar year, subject to the ability of our board of directors to take action to reduce the size of such increase in any given year. Unless our board of directors elects not to increase the number of shares underlying our 2013 Plan and ESPP each year, our stockholders may experience additional dilution, which could cause our stock price to fall.\nWe have broad discretion in the use of the net proceeds from our financing transactions and may not use them effectively.\nOur management has broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds from our financing transactions. Because of the number and variability of factors that will determine our use of the net proceeds from our financing transactions, their ultimate use may vary substantially from their currently intended use. The failure by our management to apply these funds effectively could result in financial losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, cause the price of our common stock to decline and delay the development of our product candidates. Pending their use, we have invested the net proceeds from our financing transactions in short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing securities. These investments may not yield a favorable return to our stockholders.\nVolatility in our stock price could subject us to securities class action litigation.\nIn the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following a decline in the market price of its securities. This risk is especially relevant for us because pharmaceutical companies have experienced significant stock price volatility in recent years. If we face such litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could harm our business.\nComprehensive tax reform could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nOn December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law the Tax Act which significantly revises the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The Tax Act, among other things, contains significant changes to corporate taxation, including reduction of the corporate tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21%, limitation of the tax deduction for interest expense to 30% of adjusted earnings (except for certain small businesses), limitation of the deduction for net operating losses generated in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, to 80% of current year taxable income, elimination of most carrybacks of net operating losses arising in taxable years ending after December 31, 2017, one time taxation of offshore earnings at reduced rates regardless of whether they are repatriated, elimination of U.S. tax on foreign earnings (subject to certain important exceptions), immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time, and modifying or repealing many business deductions and credits. Notwithstanding the reduction in the corporate income tax rate, the overall impact of the Tax Act is uncertain and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected. In addition, it is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the Tax Act. The impact of this tax reform on holders of our common stock is also uncertain and could be adverse. We urge our stockholders to consult with their legal and tax advisors with respect to this legislation and the potential tax consequences of investing in or holding our common stock.\nOur effective tax rate may fluctuate, and we may incur obligations in tax jurisdictions in excess of accrued amounts.\nOur effective tax rate is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various places that we operate. In preparing our financial statements, we estimate the amount of tax that will become payable in each of such places. Nevertheless, our effective tax rate may be different than experienced in the past due to numerous factors, including passage of the Tax Act, the results of examinations and audits of our tax filings, our inability to secure or sustain acceptable agreements with tax authorities, changes in accounting for income taxes and changes in tax laws. Any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations and may result in tax obligations in excess of amounts accrued in our financial statements.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nOur U.S. net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards generated in tax years ending on or prior to December 31, 2017, are only permitted to be carried forward for 20 years under applicable U.S. tax law. Under the Tax Act, our federal NOLs generated in tax years ending after December 31, 2017, may be carried forward indefinitely. The CARES Act revised the NOL limitations such that the of federal NOLs in tax years beginning after December 31, 2020, is limited to 80% of taxable income. It is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the Tax Act. In addition, under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and corresponding provisions of state law, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d which is generally defined as a greater than 50% change, by value, in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change NOL carryforwards and other pre-change U.S. tax attributes (such as research tax credits) to offset its post-change income or taxes may be limited. We have determined that a Section 382 ownership change occurred in 2002 and 2007 resulting in limitations of at least $64,000 and $762,000, respectively, of losses incurred prior to the respective ownership change dates. In addition, we have determined that another Section 382 ownership change occurred in 2013 with our IPO, our most recent private placement and other transactions that have occurred since 2007, resulting in a limitation of at least $6.7 million of losses incurred prior to the ownership change date. We may also experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership. As a result, our pre-2018 NOL carryforwards may expire prior to being used, and our NOL carryforwards generated in 2018 and thereafter will be subject to a percentage limitation. In addition, it is possible that we have in the past undergone, and in the future may undergo, additional ownership changes that could limit our ability to use all of our pre-change NOLs and other pre-change tax attributes (such as research tax credits) to offset our post-change income or taxes. Similar provisions of state tax law may also apply to limit our use of accumulated state tax attributes. In addition, at the state level, there may be periods during which the use of NOLs is suspended or otherwise limited, which could accelerate or permanently increase state taxes owed. As a result, we may be unable to use all or a material portion of our NOLs and other tax attributes.\nBecause we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, would be your sole source of gain.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We currently anticipate that we will retain any future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock would be your sole source of gain on an investment in our common stock for the foreseeable future.\nProvisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us or increase the cost of acquiring us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nSome provisions of our charter documents and Delaware law may have anti-takeover effects that could discourage an acquisition of us by others, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management. These provisions include:\n\u2022authorizing the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval which could be used to institute a \u201cpoison pill\u201d that would work to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, effectively preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our board of directors;\n\u2022allowing the authorized number of our directors to be changed only by resolution of our board of directors;\n\u2022limiting the removal of directors;\n\u2022creating a staggered board of directors;\n\u2022requiring that stockholder actions must be effected at a duly called stockholder meeting and prohibiting stockholder actions by written consent;\n\u2022eliminating the ability of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders; and\n\u2022establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at duly called stockholder meetings.\nThe amendment of any of these provisions, with the exception of the ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock and designate any rights, preferences and privileges thereto, would require the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3 percent of the voting power of all of our then outstanding common stock.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. In addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which\ngenerally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an interested stockholder, unless such transactions are approved by our board of directors. This provision could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control, whether or not it is desired by or beneficial to our stockholders. Further, other provisions of Delaware law may also discourage, delay or prevent someone from acquiring us or merging with us.\nRisks Related to Information Technology\nSignificant disruptions of information technology systems or breaches of data security could adversely affect our business.\nOur business is increasingly dependent on critical, complex, and interdependent information technology (IT) systems, including Internet-based systems, to support business processes as well as internal and external communications. The size and complexity of our IT systems make us potentially vulnerable to IT system breakdowns, malicious intrusion, and computer viruses, which may result in the impairment of our ability to operate our business effectively.\nIn addition, our systems are potentially vulnerable to data security breaches-whether by employees or others-which may expose sensitive data to unauthorized persons. Such data security breaches could lead to the loss of trade secrets or other intellectual property, or could lead to the public exposure of personal information (including sensitive personal information) of our employees, clinical trial patients, customers, business partners and others.\nAny such disruption or security breach could result in legal proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, regulatory penalties, disruptions to our operations and collaborations, and damage to our reputation, which could harm our business and results of operations.\nIncreasing use of social media could give rise to liability, breaches of data security, or reputational damage.\nWe and our employees are increasingly utilizing social media tools as a means of communication both internally and externally. Despite our efforts to monitor evolving social media communication guidelines and comply with applicable rules, there is risk that the use of social media by us or our employees to communicate about our products or business may cause us to be found in violation of applicable laws and regulations. In addition, our employees may knowingly or inadvertently make use of social media in ways that may not comply with our social media policy or other legal or contractual requirements, which may give rise to liability, lead to the loss of trade secrets or other intellectual property, or result in public exposure of personal information of our employees, clinical trial patients, customers, and others. Furthermore, negative posts or comments about us or our products in social media could seriously damage our reputation, brand image, and goodwill.", "PERMNO": 13870, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "CMRX"}
