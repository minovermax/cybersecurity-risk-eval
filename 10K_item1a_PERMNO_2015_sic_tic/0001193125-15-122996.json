You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before making a decision to invest in our common stock. The description below includes any material changes to and supersedes the description of the risk factors associated with our business previously disclosed in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2014, and our Form 10-Q for the third quarter of fiscal 2015. The risks and uncertainties described below may not be the only ones we face. If any of the risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects, and may increase the risk of your investment.\nWe were incorporated in March 2005 and recapitalized in 2009. We introduced our All Flash Arrays in May 2010. The majority of our revenue growth has occurred since the first quarter of our fiscal 2012. Our limited operating history makes it difficult for you to evaluate our business and our future prospects, as well as for us to plan for and model future growth. For example, our revenue result for our fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 was below the guidance we provided the previous quarter. In addition, we have limited experience from which to formulate an accurate expectation of our product lifecycles, which could make it more difficult for us to plan our product development timelines to meet customer and market demands. We have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing industries, including the risks described in this annual report. If we do not address these risks successfully, our business and operating results would be adversely affected.\nWe have a history of losses and our liquidity position imposes risk to our operations.\nWe have incurred recurring operating losses and negative cash flows from operating activities since inception through January 31, 2015, and we have an accumulated deficit of $461.5 million as of January 31, 2015. Through\nJanuary 31, 2015, we have not generated any cash from operations and have relied primarily on the proceeds from equity offerings, debt financing and credit facilities to fund our operations. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our achieving profitability or obtaining the necessary financing to fund our operations.\nWe have expended, and will continue to expend, substantial funds to pursue engineering, research and development projects, enhance sales and marketing efforts and otherwise operate our business. We may not be profitable on a quarterly or annual basis in the future. Our existing cash balance and any cash flow from operating activities may not be sufficient to satisfy current obligations or finance our operations. Our existing lines of credit may not be available to us, when needed in the future. If we are not able to finance our expected future operations from existing cash, future cash flows and new capital, we may need to curtail our operations. We may consider various alternatives to remedy any future shortfall in capital. We may deem it necessary to raise capital through equity markets, debt markets or other financing arrangements that may be available. Should we be unable to raise sufficient capital in a timely manner, our operations could be negatively affected or it may create doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe may elect to raise or might require additional capital to support business growth, and this capital might not be available on acceptable terms, or at all.\nWe intend to continue to make investments to support our business and may seek or be required to seek additional funds to respond to business challenges, including the need to develop new products or enhance our existing products, enhance our operating infrastructure and acquire complementary businesses and technologies. Accordingly, we may need to engage in equity or debt financing to secure additional funds. We recently raised additional funds through the issuance of convertible debt securities and our stockholders could suffer significant dilution. If we issue additional equity or convertible debt securities, our stockholders could suffer additional significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock.\nFor example, if we issue preferred stock to raise capital, the holders of preferred stock may have liquidation rights senior to our holders of common stock, which would allow them to receive proceeds from a sale of our Company at a preferred rate over our common holders. Any additional debt financing could involve restrictive covenants, which may restrict our flexibility in operating our business and make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions.\nWe may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited, and our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects could be adversely affected.\nWe have incurred significant net losses and may not achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe have incurred a net loss in each quarter since our inception. As of January 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of $461.5 million. We expect to incur losses in future periods as we continue to increase our expenses in order to position us to grow our business. If our revenue does not increase substantially, we will not be profitable. Even if we achieve profitability in a particular period, we may not be able to sustain it.\nOur historical revenue growth rate is not likely to recur and is not indicative of our future performance.\nOur revenue and our revenue growth rates achieved in prior periods may not be indicative of our future revenue or revenue growth rates. While we have experienced significant revenue growth rates in the years ended January 31, 2014 and 2013, we did not achieve a similar revenue growth rate for the year ended January 31, 2015. For example, our revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2015 declined by approximately $9.9 million as\ncompared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. Our revenue for any prior quarterly or annual periods may not be indicative of our future revenue or revenue growth. If our revenue does not grow, it may be difficult to achieve and maintain profitability.\nOur overall business has experienced rapid growth in recent periods, and we may not be able to sustain or manage any future growth effectively.\nWe have significantly expanded our overall business, customer base and operations, and we anticipate that this growth will continue. Our future operating results depend to a large extent on our ability to successfully manage our anticipated expansion and growth.\nTo manage our growth successfully, we believe we must effectively, among other things:\n\u2022\nmaintain and extend our leadership in the development of the all flash array market;\n\u2022\ncompete effectively in the primary storage market with our new Flash Storage Platform, including our Concerto OS 7 operating system software;\n\u2022\nmaintain our direct sales force as well as grow and expand our relationships with key customers, systems vendors and technology partners;\n\u2022\nexpand our channel relationships;\n\u2022\nforecast and control expenses;\n\u2022\nrecruit, hire, train and manage additional research and development, and sales and marketing personnel;\n\u2022\nexpand our customer support capabilities on a global basis;\n\u2022\nenhance and expand our distribution and supply chain infrastructure;\n\u2022\nmanage inventory levels, including trial deployments of systems;\n\u2022\nenhance and expand our international operations; and\n\u2022\nimplement and improve our administrative, financial and operational systems, procedures and controls.\nWe expect that our future growth will continue to place a significant strain on our managerial, administrative, operational, financial and other resources. We will incur costs to support this anticipated growth prior to realizing any benefits, and the return on these investments may be lower, or may develop more slowly, than we expect or may be nonexistent. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities or develop new products or enhancements to existing products and we may fail to satisfy end-customers\u2019 requirements, maintain product quality, execute on our business plan or respond to competitive pressures, any of which would adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe compete with large data storage providers and expect competition to intensify in the future from established companies and new market entrants.\nThe market for primary data storage products is highly competitive, and we expect competition to intensify in the future. Our products compete with various high-performance array-based storage approaches employed by next-generation datacenters. Competitors include incumbent primary storage vendors, such as EMC, HP, Hitachi, IBM and NetApp, which typically sell centralized storage products as well as high-performance storage approaches utilizing solid state drives, or SSDs, as well as vertically integrated appliance vendors such as Oracle. In addition, a number of privately-held and newly public companies are attempting to enter our market, some of which may become significant competitors in the future.\nMany of our current competitors have, and some of our potential competitors could have, longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger customer bases and significantly greater financial, technical, sales,\nmarketing and other resources than we have. Potential customers may prefer to purchase from their existing suppliers rather than a new supplier regardless of product performance or features. New start-up companies continue to innovate and may invent similar or superior products and technologies that may compete with our products and technology. Some of our competitors have made acquisitions of businesses that may allow them to offer more directly competitive and comprehensive solutions than they had previously offered. In addition, some of our competitors, including our systems vendor customers, may develop competing technologies and sell at zero or negative margins, through product bundling, closed technology platforms or otherwise, to gain business. Our current and potential competitors may also establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties. In addition, consolidations among systems vendors, which can occur unexpectedly, can significantly impact our sales efforts to systems vendors. As a result, we cannot assure you that our products will compete favorably, and any failure to do so could seriously harm our business, operating results and financial condition. Due to the class action litigation and management turnover, our competitors may attempt to use this information against us, which could delay or prevent future business.\nCompetitive factors could make it more difficult for us to sell our products, resulting in increased pricing pressure, reduced gross margins, increased sales and marketing expenses, longer customer sales cycles and failure to increase, or the loss of, market share, any of which could seriously harm our business, operating results and financial condition. Any failure to meet and address competitive challenges could seriously harm our business and operating results.\nIf our new Flash Storage Platform products are not successful, our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur ability to compete effectively in the primary storage market is dependent upon the success of our new Flash Storage Platform 7300, 7300E and 7700 products. If our new Flash Storage Platform products are not successful, it will be difficult for us to compete in the primary storage market with our current products at margins that enable us to achieve and maintain profitability. We could face increased pricing pressure, reduced gross margins, increased sales and marketing expenses, longer customer sales cycles and the loss of market share. In addition, if we have to compete in the primary storage market with our 6000 Series products, we could be forced to modify substantially our cost structure and business strategy, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nWe expect large and concentrated purchases by a limited number of customers to continue to represent a majority of our product revenue, and any loss of, or delay or reduction in purchases by a small number of customers could adversely affect our operating results.\nHistorically, large purchases by a relatively limited number of customers have accounted for a majority of our product revenue, and the composition of the group of our largest customers has changed from period to period. These concentrated purchases are made on a purchase order basis rather than pursuant to long-term contracts. Total revenue from our five largest customers for the years ended January 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were 30%, 35% and 37%, respectively.\nAs a consequence of our limited number of customers, the concentrated nature of their purchases and the timing of purchases from these large customers, our quarterly revenue and operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and are difficult to estimate. Any acceleration or delay in anticipated product purchases or the acceptance of shipped products by our larger customers could materially impact our revenue and operating results in any quarterly period. For example, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, a couple large customers decided to evaluate our new Flash Storage Platform instead of continuing with their purchases of our 6000 Series products. Consequently, our revenue for the period was below our guidance and declined slightly as compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2015. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to offset the discontinuation or reduction of concentrated purchases by our larger customers with purchases by other new or existing customers. We expect that sales of our products to a limited number of customers will continue to\ncontribute materially to our revenue for the foreseeable future. The loss of, or a significant delay or reduction in purchases by, a small number of customers could materially harm our business and operating results.\nToshiba is our sole supplier for flash memory. Any disruption in our relationship with Toshiba could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe most significant component that we use in our products is flash memory. Although we have an agreement with Toshiba, the sole supplier of our flash memory components, we may experience a shortage of flash memory if Toshiba is not able to meet our demand. Toshiba may not be able to meet our demand for a variety of reasons, including our inability to forecast our future needs accurately to Toshiba or a shortfall in production by Toshiba for reasons unrelated to us. In addition, our agreement with Toshiba does not provide us with fixed pricing for flash memory, which subjects us to fluctuations in pricing. Our agreement with Toshiba also requires us to purchase 70% of our annual requirement for flash memory from Toshiba, subject to specified conditions, and to design our products to be substantially compatible with Toshiba flash memory. If Toshiba were to increase the price of its flash memory, we may not be able to implement a corresponding increase in the price of our products and our revenue and gross margins would be materially adversely affected. In addition, if the flash memory we purchase from Toshiba is not competitive with the performance of other flash memory in the market, the competitiveness of our products may be adversely affected and our business could suffer. For example, the introduction of three dimensional, or 3D, flash memory allows for improved economics. We will need to find supply in a timely manner in order to develop future generations of product. We do not currently have any agreement in place with other flash memory providers in the event that Toshiba cannot meet our demand or we are unable to renew our contract with Toshiba. If we cannot obtain sufficient supply of flash memory at an acceptable price to us, our ability to respond to our customer demand and grow our business could be significantly harmed.\nOur agreements with Toshiba, our sole supplier of flash memory, may not be the result of arm\u2019s-length negotiations because Toshiba is also one of our principal stockholders.\nWe have entered into agreements with Toshiba, one of our principal stockholders, relating to our purchase of flash memory from Toshiba, and we may enter into additional agreements with Toshiba and its affiliates. Although we believe that the terms in our agreements, as a whole, are no less favorable to us than could be obtained through arm\u2019s-length dealing, these agreements include specific terms and conditions that may be different from terms contained in comparable agreements with unaffiliated third parties. In addition, because Toshiba is also one of our principal stockholders and because we have a significant relationship with Toshiba, it may be difficult or impossible for us to enforce claims that we may have against it. Although we have a significant relationship with Toshiba, we may not be able to successfully negotiate and execute future agreements, or we may not do so on terms that are beneficial to us or on terms that we currently anticipate.\nOur products are highly technical and may contain undetected defects, which could cause data unavailability, loss or corruption that might, in turn, result in liability to our customers and harm to our reputation and business.\nOur All Flash Array products, including our new Flash Storage Platform and Concerto OS 7 operating system software, and related software are highly technical and complex and are often used to store information critical to our end-customers\u2019 business operations. Our products may contain undetected errors, defects or security vulnerabilities that could result in data unavailability, loss or corruption or other harm to our end-customers. Some errors in our products may only be discovered after they have been installed and used by end-customers. Any errors, defects or security vulnerabilities discovered in our products after commercial release, or any perception of the same in the marketplace, could result in a loss of revenue or delay in revenue recognition, injury to our reputation, a loss of end-customers or increased service and warranty costs, any of which could adversely affect our business. In addition, we could face claims for product liability, tort or breach of warranty. Many of our contracts with customers contain provisions relating to warranty disclaimers and liability\nlimitations, which may be difficult to enforce. Defending a lawsuit, regardless of its merit, would be costly and might divert management\u2019s attention and adversely affect the market\u2019s perception of us and our products. In addition, our business liability insurance coverage could prove inadequate or could be subject to coverage exclusions or deductibles with respect to a claim and future coverage may be unavailable on acceptable terms or at all. These product-related issues could result in claims against us and our business could be adversely impacted.\nServicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal amount of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness, including our convertible senior notes, depends upon our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and other fixed charges, fund working capital needs, and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at the time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations.\nWe may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to pay interest on our convertible senior notes, to repurchase the notes upon a fundamental change or to settle conversions of the notes in cash.\nOur convertible senior notes bear interest semi-annually at a rate of 4.25% per year. In addition, in certain circumstances, we are obligated to pay additional interest or special interest on the notes. If a \u201cfundamental change\u201d occurs, holders of the notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes in cash. Furthermore, if we obtain stockholder approval, upon conversion of any notes, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle the conversion (excluding cash in lieu of delivering fractional shares of our common stock), we must make cash payments in respect of the notes. Any of the cash payments described above could be significant, and we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing so that we can make such payments when due or to repay the indebtedness under our then outstanding credit facilities in order to be permitted to make such cash payments. Our existing credit agreement prohibits us from making any optional prepayments with respect to the notes, which may potentially restrict our ability to make any cash payments upon conversion, and the events that would trigger a fundamental change would be default under the credit agreement, which could prohibit us from repurchasing the notes. In addition, our ability to repurchase the notes or to pay cash upon conversions of the notes may be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our future indebtedness. If we fail to pay interest on the notes, repurchase the notes when required or deliver the consideration due upon conversion, we will be in default under the indenture. A default under the indenture would be a default under our credit agreement and could lead also to a default under the agreements governing our future indebtedness. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the notes or make cash payments upon conversion of the notes. Our inability to do so could result in a default on our debt obligations.\nOur operating results may fluctuate significantly, which could make our future results difficult to predict and could cause our operating results to fall below expectations.\nOur operating results may fluctuate due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. You should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance. If our revenue or operating results fall below expectations, the price of our common stock would likely decline.\nFactors that are difficult to predict and that could cause our operating results to fluctuate include:\n\u2022\nthe timing and magnitude of orders, shipments and acceptance of our products in any quarter, including orders from large customers;\n\u2022\na postponement or cancellation of significant orders;\n\u2022\ncost and timing of trial deployments;\n\u2022\nproduct mix;\n\u2022\nmix of sales between end-customers and channel partners;\n\u2022\navailability of, and our ability to control the costs of, the components we use in our hardware products, specifically flash memory;\n\u2022\nreductions in customers\u2019 budgets for information technology purchases;\n\u2022\nadditional restrictions on our ability to export our products;\n\u2022\ndelays in end-customers\u2019 purchasing cycles or deferments of end-customers\u2019 product purchases in anticipation of new products or product enhancements from us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nany change in the competitive dynamics of our markets, including actions by large storage providers who may discount product prices or bundle storage products to provide lower overall systems costs;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in demand and prices for our products;\n\u2022\nchanges in standards in the data storage industry;\n\u2022\nour ability to develop, introduce and ship in a timely manner new products and product enhancements that meet end-customer requirements;\n\u2022\nour ability to control costs, including our operating expenses; and\n\u2022\nfuture accounting pronouncements and changes in accounting policies.\nThe occurrence of any one of these risks could negatively affect our operating results in any particular quarter and cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nOur sales cycles can be long and unpredictable, particularly with respect to large orders and establishing systems vendor and systems integrator relationships that require considerable time and expense. As a result, it can be difficult for us to predict when, if ever, a particular customer will choose to purchase our products, which may cause our operating results to fluctuate significantly.\nOur sales efforts include convincing end-customers of our products\u2019 reliability and interoperability with their existing network infrastructure. Because our products are based on emerging flash technology, we often must invest time in educating our potential end-customers of the benefits of flash technology over legacy technologies, such as HDDs. Customers often undertake a trial deployment to evaluate and test our products which can result in a lengthy sales cycle. We spend substantial time and resources on our sales efforts without any assurance that our efforts will produce any sales. In addition, product purchases are frequently subject to budget constraints, multiple approvals and unplanned administrative, processing and other delays. Additionally, a significant portion of our sales personnel have been with us for less than a year, and we continue to increase the number of our sales personnel, which could further extend the sales cycle as these new personnel typically require a significant amount of training and experience until they are productive. These factors, among others, result in long and unpredictable sales cycles, particularly with respect to large orders and the establishment of system vendor and systems integrator relationships. Further, we may invest significant management attention and expense in building relationships that do not ultimately result in successful sales.\nWe also sell to systems vendors and systems integrators that incorporate our products into their solutions, which can require an extended evaluation and testing process before our product is approved for inclusion in one of their solutions. We also may be required to customize our product to interoperate with a systems vendor\u2019s solution, which could further lengthen the sales cycle for sales to systems vendors.\nThe length of our sales cycle makes us susceptible to the risk of delays or termination of orders if end-customers decide to delay or withdraw funding for datacenter projects, which could occur for various reasons, including global economic cycles and capital market fluctuations. In addition, as a result of the lengthy and uncertain sales cycles of our products, it is difficult for us to predict when customers may purchase products from us and as a result, our operating results may vary significantly and be adversely affected.\nIneffective management of product transitions or our inventory levels, including inventory used in trial deployments, could adversely affect our operating results.\nIf we are unable to properly forecast, monitor, control and manage our inventory and maintain appropriate inventory levels and mix of products to support our customers\u2019 needs, we may incur increased and unexpected costs. Sales of our products are generally made through individual purchase orders and some of our customers place large orders with short lead times, which make it difficult to predict demand for our products and the level of inventory that we need to maintain in order to satisfy customer demand. If we build our inventory in anticipation of future demand that does not materialize, or if a customer cancels or postpones outstanding orders, we could experience an unanticipated increase in the inventory level of our finished products which would cause us to incur manufacturing costs in a period that are not offset by sales of finished products. In addition, our inability to manage inventory levels in connection with future product transitions may harm our operating results. For example, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we incurred a provision for excess and obsolete inventory of $17.6 million and an increase in accrued liabilities of $2.3 million for non-cancellable purchase orders when we transitioned from our 6000 Series All Flash Array to our new Flash Storage Platform. In addition, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, we incurred a provision for excess and obsolete inventory related to our PCIe inventory and non-cancellable purchase commitments of $9.2 million. Alternatively, we could carry insufficient inventory, and we may not be able to satisfy demand, which could have a material adverse effect on our customer relationships or cause us to lose potential sales.\nWe typically provide trial deployments to potential customers and maintain the classification of these products in the field as inventory. We may not be able to convert these trial deployments into sales, which could lead to higher levels of inventory, lost or damaged units, risk of obsolescence and excessive wear making them unsaleable or saleable only at low margin or at a loss. Although our sales contracts typically provide that we are not obligated to accept product returns, except for warranty claims, for purchased products, in limited circumstances, we may determine that it is in our best interest to accept returns or exchange products in order to maintain good relationships with customers. Product returns or exchanges would increase our inventory and reduce our revenue. If we are unable to sell our inventory in a timely manner, we could incur additional carrying costs, reduced inventory turns and potential write-downs due to obsolescence, particularly in periods of product transition.\nThe occurrence of any of these risks related to inventory could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur gross profit may vary and such variation may make it more difficult to forecast our earnings.\nOur gross profit has been and may continue to be affected by a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022\ndemand for our products and related services;\n\u2022\ndiscount levels and price competition;\n\u2022\naverage order size and customer mix;\n\u2022\nproduct mix;\n\u2022\nthe provision for excess or obsolete inventory;\n\u2022\nthe cost and availability of components;\n\u2022\nlevel of costs for providing customer support;\n\u2022\nthe mix of services or software as a percentage of revenue;\n\u2022\nnew product introductions and enhancements; and\n\u2022\ngeographic sales mix.\nAny of these factors could adversely affect our gross profit and operating results compared to prior periods or future expectations from us or analysts who have issued research reports about us.\nMany of our established competitors have long-standing relationships with key decision makers at many of our current and prospective customers. As a result, we may not be able to compete effectively and maintain or increase our market share.\nMany of our competitors benefit from established brand awareness and long-standing relationships with key decision makers at many of our current and prospective customers. We expect that our competitors will seek to leverage these existing relationships to discourage customers from purchasing our products. In particular, when competing against us, we expect our competitors to emphasize the importance of data storage retention, the high cost of data storage failure and the perceived risks of relying on products from a company with a shorter operating history and less predictable operating results. Additionally, most of our prospective customers have existing storage systems manufactured by our competitors. This gives an incumbent competitor an advantage in retaining the customer because the incumbent competitor already understands the customer\u2019s network infrastructure, user demands and information technology needs. These factors may cause our current or prospective customers to be unwilling to purchase our products and instead to purchase the products of our better-known and more established competitors. In the event that we are unable to successfully sell our products to new customers, persuade customers of our competitors to purchase our products instead, or prevent our competitors from persuading our customers to purchase our competitors\u2019 products, we may not be able to maintain or increase our market share and our operating results would be adversely affected.\nThe use of flash memory in storage products is rapidly evolving, which makes it difficult to forecast customer adoption rates and demand for our products.\nThe market for flash memory in storage products is rapidly evolving. Accordingly, our future financial performance will depend in large part on growth in this market and on our ability to adapt to trends in this market as they develop and evolve. Sales of our products are dependent in large part upon our ability to penetrate the primary storage market in addition to markets that require high-performance data storage solutions, such as business-critical applications, virtualization and Big Data. It is difficult to predict with any precision customer adoption rates, end-customer demand for our products or the future growth rate and size of our market. The rapidly evolving nature of the technology in the data storage products market, as well as other factors that are beyond our control, reduce our ability to accurately predict our future performance. Our products may never gain broad adoption, and changes or advances in technologies could adversely affect the demand for our products. Further, although flash-based data storage products have a number of advantages compared to other data storage alternatives, flash-based storage devices have certain disadvantages as well, including increased utilization of host system resources than traditional storage, and in some circumstances may require end-customers to modify or replace network systems originally installed for traditional storage media. A reduction in demand for flash-based data storage caused by lack of end-customer acceptance, technological challenges, competing technologies and products or otherwise would result in a lower revenue growth rate or decreased revenue, either of which would negatively impact our business and operating results.\nWe have derived substantially all of our revenue from a single line of products, and a decline in demand for these products would cause our revenue to grow more slowly or to decline.\nOur All Flash Array product line has accounted for substantially all of our revenue, and the Flash Storage Platform is expected to comprise a significant portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future. As a result, our revenue could be reduced by:\n\u2022\nthe failure of our All Flash Arrays and Flash Storage Platform products to achieve broad market acceptance;\n\u2022\nany decline or fluctuation in demand for our All Flash Array or Flash Storage Platform products, whether as a result of product obsolescence, technological change, customer budgetary constraints or other factors;\n\u2022\nany constraint on our ability to meet demand for our products, whether as a result of component supply constraint or the inability or unwillingness of our contract manufacturer to timely deliver products;\n\u2022\npricing pressures;\n\u2022\nthe introduction of products and technologies by competitors that serve as a replacement or substitute for, or represent an improvement over, these products;\n\u2022\nan order resulting from a judgment of patent infringement or otherwise, that restricts our ability to market and sell our products; and\n\u2022\nour inability to release enhanced versions of our products, including any related software or future generations of products, on a timely basis.\nIf we fail to develop and introduce new or enhanced products on a timely basis, our ability to attract and retain customers could be impaired and our competitive position would be harmed.\nWe operate in a dynamic environment characterized by rapidly changing technologies and industry standards and technological obsolescence. To compete successfully, we must design, develop, market and sell new or enhanced products that provide increasingly higher levels of performance, capacity and reliability and meet the cost expectations of our customers. The introduction of new products by our competitors, the market acceptance of products based on new or alternative technologies, or the emergence of new industry standards could render our existing or future products obsolete. Our failure to anticipate or timely develop new or enhanced products or technologies in response to technological shifts could result in decreased revenue and harm our business. If we fail to introduce new or enhanced products that meet the needs of our customers or penetrate new markets in a timely fashion, we will lose market share and our operating results will be adversely affected.\nIn order to maintain or increase our gross margins, we need to continue to create valuable software solutions to be integrated with our products. Any new feature or application that we develop or acquire may not be introduced in a timely or cost-effective manner and may not achieve the broad market acceptance necessary to increase our overall gross margins. If we are unable to successfully develop or acquire, and then market and sell future generations of our products, our ability to increase our revenue and gross margin will be adversely affected.\nOur products must interoperate with network interfaces, such as operating systems, software applications and hardware developed by others, and if we are unable to ensure that our products interoperate with such software and hardware, we may fail to increase, or we may lose, market share and we may experience reduced demand for our products.\nOur storage products comprise only a part of a datacenter\u2019s infrastructure. Accordingly, our products must interoperate with our end-customers\u2019 existing infrastructure, specifically their networks, servers, software and operating systems, which are typically manufactured by a wide variety of systems vendors. When new or updated versions of these software operating systems or applications are introduced, we must sometimes develop updated versions of our software so that our products interoperate properly. We may not accomplish these development\nefforts quickly, cost-effectively or at all. These development efforts require capital investment and the devotion of engineering resources. If we fail to maintain compatibility with these applications, our end-customers may not be able to adequately utilize the data stored on our products, and we may, among other consequences, fail to increase, or we may lose, market share and experience reduced demand for our products, which would adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe rely on our key technical, sales and management personnel to grow our business, and the loss of one or more key employees or the inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could harm our business.\nOur success and future growth depends to a significant degree on the skills and continued services of our key technical, sales and management personnel. In particular, we are highly dependent on the services of our Chief Executive Officer, Kevin A. DeNuccio. We also are very dependent on the services of our senior vice presidents. We could experience difficulty in integrating and retaining members of our senior management team. We do not have \u201ckey person\u201d life insurance policies that cover any of our officers or other key employees. The loss of the services of any of our key employees could disrupt our operations, delay the development and introduction of our products, and negatively impact our business, prospects and operating results.\nIn the longer term, we expect to hire personnel in all areas of our business, particularly in sales and research and development. Competition for these types of personnel is intense. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully attract or retain qualified personnel. Our inability to attract and retain the necessary personnel could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe intend to continue focusing on revenue growth and increasing market penetration at the expense of profitability by investing in our operations.\nWe intend to make investments in our marketing services and sales organization and to continue investing in research and development at the expense of near-term profitability. We believe our decision to continue investing in these operations will be critical to our revenue growth and our increased market penetration. Accordingly, we anticipate that our investments will result in continued net losses for at least the next twelve months. However, we cannot assure you that this strategy will result in revenue growth. Even if we achieve significant revenue growth, we may continue to experience net losses and operating losses similar to those we have incurred historically. Additionally, at least as long as we pursue this strategy, we may not achieve profitability or, if achieved, we may not be able to sustain profitability.\nWe are exposed to the credit risk of some of our customers and to credit exposure in weakened markets, which could result in material losses.\nMost of our sales are on an open credit basis, which subjects us to the risk of loss resulting in nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers. Although we have programs in place that are designed to monitor and mitigate our customers\u2019 credit risks, we cannot assure you these programs will be effective in reducing our credit risks, especially as we expand our business internationally. If we are unable to adequately control these risks, our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.\nOur research and development efforts may not produce successful products that result in significant revenue in the near future, if at all.\nDeveloping our products and related enhancements is expensive. Our investments in research and development may not result in marketable products or may result in products that are more expensive than anticipated, take longer to generate revenue or generate less revenue, if at all, than we anticipate. Our future plans include significant investments in research and development and related product opportunities. We believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position. However, we may not receive significant revenue from these investments in the near future, if at all, which could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nDevelopments or improvements in storage system technologies may materially adversely affect the demand for our products.\nSignificant developments in data storage systems, such as advances in solid state storage drives or improvements in non-volatile memory, may materially and adversely affect our business and prospects in ways we do not currently anticipate. For example, improvements in existing data storage technologies, such as a significant increase in the speed of traditional interfaces for transferring data between storage and a server or the speed of traditional embedded controllers, could emerge as preferred alternatives to our products, especially if they are sold at lower prices. This could be the case even if such advances do not deliver all of the benefits of our products. Any failure on our part to demonstrate the benefits of our products would result in lost sales. In addition, any failure by us to develop new or enhanced technologies or processes, or to react to changes or advances in existing technologies, including the development of the new 3D flash memory technology, could materially delay our development and introduction of new products, which could result in the loss of competitiveness of our products, decreased revenue and a loss of market share to competitors.\nThe rate at which we grow our business is impacted by systems vendor customers incorporating our products into their vertically integrated appliances and data storage systems and these systems vendors\u2019 sales efforts. Any failure to grow our systems vendor sales and maintain relationships with systems vendors or systems integrators could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nHistorically, sales of products to systems vendors have represented a significant portion of our revenue. In some cases, our products must be designed into the systems vendor\u2019s products. If that fails to occur for a given product line of a systems vendor, we would likely be unable to sell our products to that systems vendor for that product line during the life cycle of that product. Even if a systems vendor integrates one or more of our products into its solutions, we cannot assure that its product will be commercially successful, and as a result, our sales volumes may be less than anticipated. Our systems vendor customers are typically not obligated to purchase our products and can choose at any time to stop using our products if their own systems are not commercially successful or if they decide to pursue other strategies or for any other reason, including the incorporation or development of competing products by these systems vendors.\nMoreover, our systems vendor and systems integrator customers may not devote sufficient attention and resources to selling our products. We may not be able to develop or maintain relationships with systems vendor and systems integrator customers for a number of reasons, including because of their relationships with our competitors or prospective competitors. In addition, there may be competing incentives that may not motivate their internal sales forces to promote our products. If we are unable to grow our sales to systems vendors, if our system vendor customers\u2019 systems incorporating our products are not commercially successful, if our products are not designed into a given systems vendor product cycle or into a systems integrator\u2019s solution or if our systems vendor customers significantly reduce, cancel or delay their orders with us, our revenue would suffer and our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nOur ability to sell our products is highly dependent on the quality of our customer support and services, and any failure to offer high-quality support and services would harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOnce our products are deployed, our customers depend on our support organization to resolve any issues relating to our products. Our products provide business-critical services to our customers and a high level of customer support is necessary to maintain our customer relationships. We rely on authorized service providers in certain locations in the United States to install our products and deliver initial levels of on-site customer support and services. While we attempt to carefully identify, train and certify our authorized service providers, we may not be successful in ensuring the proper delivery and installation of our products or the quality or responsiveness of the support and services being provided.\nAs we grow our business, our ability to provide effective customer support and services will be largely dependent on our ability to attract, train and retain qualified direct customer service personnel and our ability to maintain\nand grow our network of authorized service providers. Additionally, as we continue to expand our operations internationally, our support organization will face additional challenges, including those associated with delivering support, training and documentation in languages other than English, as well as identifying, training and certifying international authorized service providers to support products we may deploy in geographical areas in which we may not currently have authorized service providers.\nAny failure to maintain high-quality customer support and services, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality customer support and services, could harm our reputation, adversely affect our ability to sell our products to existing and prospective customers, and could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIf our security measures are breached or unauthorized access to our data is otherwise obtained, our solutions may be perceived as not being secure, customers may reduce the use of or stop using our solutions and we may incur significant liabilities.\nSecurity breaches could result in the loss of information, litigation, indemnity obligations and other liability. While we have security measures in place, our systems and networks are subject to ongoing threats and therefore these security measures may be breached as a result of third-party action, including cyber-attacks or other intentional misconduct by computer hackers, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise. This could result in one or more third parties obtaining unauthorized access to our data, including intellectual property and other confidential business information. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Third parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords or other information in order to gain access to our data, including intellectual property and other confidential business information. If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed, we could lose potential sales and existing customers or we could incur other liability.\nSome of our large end-customers demand more favorable terms and conditions from us and may request price concessions. As we seek to sell more products to large end-customers, we may be required to agree to terms and conditions that may have an adverse effect on our business or ability to recognize revenue.\nSome of our large end-customers have significant purchasing power and, accordingly, have requested and received from us more favorable terms and conditions, including lower prices and extended payment terms, than we typically provide. As we seek to sell more products to this class of customer, we may be required to agree to more favorable customer terms and conditions, which may include terms that affect the timing of our revenue recognition or may reduce our gross margins and have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nWe rely on systems vendors and resellers to sell our products in markets where we do not have a direct sales force, and on authorized service providers to service and support our products in markets where we do not have direct customer service personnel. Any disruptions to, or failure to develop and manage, our relationships with systems vendors, resellers and authorized service providers could have an adverse effect on our customer relationships and on our ability to increase revenue.\nOur future success is highly dependent upon our ability to establish and maintain successful relationships with a variety of systems vendors, resellers and authorized service providers in markets where we do not have a direct sales force or direct customer service personnel. We currently have sales personnel in over 15 countries. In other markets, we rely and expect to continue to rely on establishing relationships with systems vendors, resellers and authorized service providers. Our ability to maintain or grow our international revenue will depend, in part, on our ability to carefully select, manage and expand our network of systems vendor partners, resellers and authorized service providers. In addition to their sales activities, our systems vendor partners also provide\ninstallation, post-sale service and support on our behalf in their local markets. We also have agreements with authorized service providers that deliver and install our products, as well as provide post-sale customer service and support, on our behalf in their local markets. In markets where we rely on systems vendor partners, resellers and authorized service providers, we have less contact with our customers and less control over the sales process and their responsiveness. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to ensure the proper delivery and installation of our products or the quality or responsiveness of the support and services being offered. Any failure on our part to effectively identify and train our systems vendor partners, resellers and authorized service providers and to monitor their sales activity as well as the customer support and services being provided to our customers in their local markets could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIdentifying, training, and retaining qualified systems vendors, resellers and authorized service providers requires significant time and resources. In order to maintain and expand our network of systems vendor partners, resellers and authorized service providers, we must continue to scale and improve the systems, processes, and procedures that support them, which will require continuing investment in our information technology infrastructure and dedication of significant training resources. As we grow our business and support organization, these systems, processes, and procedures may become increasingly complex, difficult and expensive to manage, particularly as the geographic scope of our customer base expands globally.\nWe typically enter into non-exclusive agreements with our systems vendor partners, resellers and authorized service providers. These agreements generally have a one-year, self-renewing term, have no minimum sales commitment, and do not prohibit our systems vendor partners, resellers and authorized service providers from offering products and services that compete with ours. Accordingly, our systems vendor partners, resellers and authorized service providers may choose to discontinue offering our products and services or may not devote sufficient attention and resources toward selling our products and services. Additionally, our competitors may provide incentives to our existing and potential systems vendor partners, resellers and authorized service providers to use, purchase or offer their products and services which may prevent or reduce sales of our products and services. The occurrence of any of these events could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIf our third-party hardware repair service fails to timely and correctly resolve hardware failures experienced by our end-customers, our reputation will suffer, our competitive position will be impaired and our expenses could increase.\nWe and our authorized service providers rely upon third-party hardware maintenance providers, which specialize in providing vendor-neutral support of storage equipment, network devices and peripherals, to provide repair services to our end-customers. If our third-party repair service fails to timely and correctly resolve hardware failures, our reputation will suffer, our competitive position will be impaired and our expenses could increase. In February 2011, we entered into a five-year agreement with IBM Global Services for our on-site response and call center support. Either party may terminate the agreement for any reason by providing the other party 120-day notice of termination. In addition, either party may immediately terminate the agreement for a material default by the other party that is not cured within 30 days. If our relationship with our third-party repair service were to end, we would have to engage a new third party provider of hardware support, and the transition could result in delays in effecting repairs and damage our reputation and competitive position as well as increase our operating expenses.\nWe rely on a single contract manufacturer to manufacture our products, and our failure to accurately forecast demand for our products or successfully manage our relationship with our contract manufacturer could negatively impact our ability to sell our products.\nWe rely on Flextronics to manufacture all of our products, manage our supply chain and, alone or together with us, negotiate component costs. We purchase our flash components directly from a single-source supplier and consign these components to Flextronics. Our reliance on our contract manufacturer reduces our control over the\nassembly process, quality assurance, production costs and product supply. If we fail to manage our relationship with our contract manufacturer or if our contract manufacturer experiences delays, disruptions, capacity constraints or quality control problems in its operations, our ability to ship products to our customers could be impaired and our competitive position and reputation could be harmed. If we or our contract manufacturer are unable to negotiate with suppliers for reduced component costs, our operating results could be harmed.\nIf we are required to change to a new contract manufacturer, qualify an additional contract manufacturer or assume internal manufacturing operations for any reason, including financial problems of our contract manufacturer, reduction of manufacturing output made available to us, or the termination of our contract, we may lose revenue, incur increased costs and damage our customer relationships. Our contract manufacturer may terminate our agreement with them with prior notice to us or for reasons such as we fail to perform a material obligation under our agreements with them. Qualifying a new contract manufacturer and commencing volume production is expensive and time-consuming.\nWe are required to provide forecasts to our contract manufacturer regarding product demand and production levels. We provide our contract manufacturer with purchase orders for products they manufacture for us, and these orders may only be rescheduled or cancelled under certain limited conditions. If we inaccurately forecast demand for our products, we may have excess or inadequate inventory or incur cancellation charges or penalties, which could adversely impact our operating results.\nWe intend to introduce new products and product enhancements, which could require us to achieve volume production rapidly by coordinating with our contract manufacturer and component suppliers. We may need to increase our component purchases, contract manufacturing capacity and internal test and quality functions if we experience increased demand for our products. Our orders may represent a relatively small percentage of the overall orders received by our contract manufacturer from their customers. As a result, fulfilling our orders may not be considered a priority in the event our contract manufacturer is constrained in its ability to fulfill all of its customer obligations in a timely manner. If our contract manufacturer is unable to provide us with adequate supplies of high-quality products, or if we or our contract manufacturer is unable to obtain adequate quantities of components, it could cause a delay in our order fulfillment, in which case our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on a limited number of suppliers, and in some cases single-source suppliers, and any disruption or termination of these supply arrangements could delay shipments of our products and could materially and adversely affect our relationships with current and prospective customers.\nWe rely on a limited number of suppliers, and in some cases single-source suppliers, for several key components of our products, and neither our contract manufacturer nor we have entered into agreements for the long-term purchase of these components. This reliance on a limited number of suppliers and the lack of any guaranteed sources of supply exposes us to several risks, including:\n\u2022\nthe inability to obtain an adequate supply of key components in a timely manner, including flash memory and field programmable gate arrays;\n\u2022\nprice volatility for the components of our products;\n\u2022\nfailure of a supplier to meet our quality, yield or production requirements;\n\u2022\nfailure of a key supplier to remain in business or adjust to market conditions; and\n\u2022\nconsolidation among suppliers, resulting in some suppliers exiting the industry or discontinuing the manufacture of components.\nIf our supply of certain components is disrupted or delayed, or if we need to replace one or more of our existing suppliers, there can be no assurance that additional supplies or components will be available when required or\nthat supplies will be available on terms that are favorable to us, which could extend our lead times, increase the costs of our components and materially adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. If we are successful in growing our business, we may not be able to continue to procure components at acceptable prices, which would require us to enter into longer term contracts with component suppliers to obtain these components at competitive prices. In addition, errors or defects may arise in some of our components supplied by third parties that are beyond our detection or control, which could lead to additional customer returns or product warranty claims. If any of these were to occur, our costs would increase and our gross margins would decrease, harming our operating results.\nOur products incorporate components that are subject to supply and pricing volatility, and, as a result, our ability to respond in a timely manner to customer demand and our cost structure are sensitive to such volatility in the supply and market prices for these components.\nWe do not enter into long-term supply contracts for the components we use in our products, but instead generally we, or our contract manufacturer on our behalf, purchase these components pursuant to individual purchase orders. In addition, it is common in the storage and networking industries for component vendors to discontinue the manufacture of certain types of components from time to time due to evolving technologies and changes in the market. If we are required to make significant \u201clast time\u201d purchases of components that are being discontinued and do not purchase enough components, we may experience delayed shipments, order cancellations or otherwise be required to purchase more expensive components to meet customer demand, which could negatively impact our revenue, gross margins and operating results. If we purchase too many such components, we could be subject to inventory write-offs adversely affecting our operating results.\nA portion of our expenses are directly related to the pricing of components utilized in the manufacture of our products, such as field programmable gate arrays, memory chips and central processing units, or CPUs. In some cases, our contract manufacturer purchases these components in a competitive-bid purchase order environment with suppliers or on the open market at spot prices. As a result, our cost structure is affected by price volatility in the marketplace for these components, especially for field programmable gate arrays, memory chips and CPUs. This volatility makes it difficult to predict expense levels and operating results, and may cause our expense levels and operating results to fluctuate significantly. Furthermore, these components can be subject to limits on supply or other supply volatility which may negatively impact our ability to obtain quantities necessary at reasonable prices to grow our business and respond to customer demand for our products.\nAs we seek to increase our sales to government customers, we may face difficulties and risks unique to government contracts and attempting to do business with the government that may have a detrimental impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nHistorically, we have sold products to the United States government through third-party resellers. Developing new business in the public sector often requires the development of relationships with different agencies or entities, as well as with other government contractors. If we are unable to develop or sustain such relationships, we may be unable to procure new contracts within the timeframes we expect, and our business, operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected. Contracting with the United States government often requires businesses to participate in a highly competitive bidding process to obtain new contracts. We may be unable to bid competitively if our products or services are improperly priced, or if we do not offer our products and services at a competitive price. The bidding process is an expensive and time-consuming endeavor that may result in a financial loss for us if we fail to win a contract on which we submitted a bid. Further, some agencies within the United States government may also require some or all of our personnel to obtain a security clearance or may require us to add features or functionality to our products that could require a significant amount of time and prevent our employees from working on other critical projects. If our key personnel are unable to obtain or retain this clearance or if we cannot or do not provide required features or functionality, we may be unsuccessful in our bid for some government contracts.\nContracts with the United States government also frequently include provisions not found in private sector contracts and are often governed by laws and regulations that do not affect private sector contracts. These provisions may permit public sector customers to take actions not always available to customers in the private sector. These actions may include termination of contracts for convenience. The United States government can also suspend operations if Congress does not allocate sufficient funds to a particular agency or organization, and the United States government may allow our competitors to protest our successful bids. The occurrence of any of these events may negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIn order to maintain contracts we may obtain with government entities, we must also comply with many rules and regulations that may affect our relationships with other customers. For example, the United States government could terminate its contracts with us if we come under foreign government control or influence, may require that we disclose our pricing data during the course of negotiations, and may require us to prevent access to classified data. If the United States government requires us to meet any of these demands, it could increase our costs or prevent us from taking advantage of certain opportunities that may present themselves in the future. The United States government routinely investigates and audits government contractors. It may audit our performance and our pricing, and review our compliance with rules and regulations. If it finds that we have improperly allocated costs, it may require us to refund those costs or may refuse to pay us for outstanding balances related to the improper allocation. An unfavorable audit could reduce our revenue, and may result in civil or criminal liability if the audit uncovers improper or illegal activities. This could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. Further, general uncertainty about the global economic recovery and ongoing fiscal and budgetary uncertainty in the United States, including the adverse economic effects of the U.S. government shutdown in October 2013 or any future possible shutdowns is likely to continue to adversely affect our ability to maintain and increase our sales to government customers, which in turn may continue to adversely affect our results of operations.\nThird-party claims that we are infringing the intellectual property rights of others, whether successful or not, could subject us to costly and time-consuming litigation, require us to acquire expensive licenses, prohibit us from selling products and harm our business.\nThe storage and networking industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We have in the past received and may in the future receive inquiries from other intellectual property holders and may become subject to claims that we infringe their intellectual property rights, particularly as we expand our presence in the market and face increasing competition. The costs associated with any actual, pending or threatened litigation could negatively impact our operating results regardless of outcome.\nWe currently have a number of agreements in effect pursuant to which we have agreed to defend, indemnify and hold harmless our customers, suppliers and channel partners from damages and costs which may arise from the infringement by our products of third-party patents, trademarks or other proprietary rights. The scope of these indemnity obligations varies, but may, in some instances, include indemnification for damages and expenses, including attorneys\u2019 fees. Our insurance may not cover intellectual property infringement claims. A claim that our products infringe a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights could harm our relationships with our customers, may deter future customers from purchasing our products and could expose us to costly litigation and settlement expenses. Even if we are not a party to any litigation between a customer and a third party relating to infringement by our products, an adverse outcome in any such litigation could make it more difficult for us to defend our products against intellectual property infringement claims in any subsequent litigation in which we are a named party. Any of these results could harm our brand and operating results.\nAny intellectual property rights claim against us or our customers, suppliers and channel partners, with or without merit, could be time-consuming, expensive to litigate or settle, divert management resources and attention and force us to acquire intellectual property rights and licenses, which may involve substantial royalty\npayments. Further, a party making such a claim, if successful, could secure a judgment that requires us to pay substantial damages. An adverse determination also could invalidate our intellectual property rights and prevent us from offering our products to our customers and may require that we procure or develop substitute products that do not infringe, which could require significant effort and expense. We may have to seek a license for the technology, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all, may significantly increase our operating expenses or require us to restrict our business activities in one or more respects. Any of these events could seriously harm our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, parties to intellectual property litigation often announce the results of hearings, motions or other interim developments, and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nThe success of our business depends in part on our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights.\nWe rely on a combination of patent, copyright, service mark, trademark, and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions, to establish and protect our proprietary rights, all of which provide only limited protection. There can be no assurance that any patents will issue with respect to our pending patent applications in a manner that gives us the protection that we seek, if at all, or that any patents issued to us will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. Our issued patents and any patents that may be issued in the future with respect to pending or future patent applications may not provide sufficiently broad protection or they may not prove to be enforceable in actions against alleged infringers. We cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology or reverse engineering of our technology. Moreover, others may independently develop technologies that are competitive with ours or that design around our intellectual property. Although we endeavor to sign confidentiality agreements with our employees and others who may have access to our trade secrets, we cannot guarantee that we have entered into these agreements with all such parties, nor that the agreements we have entered will not be breached.\nProtecting against the unauthorized use of our intellectual property, products and other proprietary rights is expensive and difficult. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Any such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of management resources, either of which could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, many of our current and potential competitors have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to defending intellectual property infringement claims and to enforcing their intellectual property rights than we have. As a result, we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property. Effective patent, trademark, service mark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our products are available.\nAn inability to adequately protect and enforce our intellectual property and other proprietary rights could seriously harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nAdverse economic conditions and reduced information technology spending could have an adverse impact on our revenue, revenue growth rates and operating results.\nOur business depends on the overall demand for information technology, and in particular for storage infrastructure, and on the capital spending budgets and financial health of our current and prospective customers. The purchase of our products is often discretionary and may require our customers to make significant initial commitments of capital. A general economic downturn, such as the slowdown that began in 2008, could dramatically reduce business spending on technology infrastructure. In response to a global economic slowdown, including a deterioration in their own financial condition, or an inability to obtain financing for capital investments, our customers and customer prospects could reduce or defer their spending on storage infrastructure, which could result in lost opportunities, declines in bookings and revenue, order cancellations or indefinite shipping delays.\nThe global economic environment has been volatile as a result of many factors, including the economic uncertainty faced by a number of European countries, the strength of the U.S. dollar, a collapse in the price of oil and other commodities, acts of terrorism and the threat of military action in other parts of the world. If this volatility continues and there is a growing weakness in general economic conditions, a reduction in storage infrastructure spending, or deterioration in the financial condition of our customers and customer prospects will adversely impact our business, revenue, operating results and financial condition, including as a result of potential inventory write downs, longer sales cycles, potential increases in price competition, reduced unit sales, increased number of days of sales outstanding and customer payment defaults.\nIf we experience declines in average selling prices, our revenue and gross profit may decline.\nThe data storage industry is highly competitive and has historically been characterized by declines in average selling prices. It is possible that the market for flash-based data storage solutions could experience similar trends. Our average selling price on a per-gigabyte basis has declined over time and could continue to decline due to pricing pressure caused by several factors, including competition, the introduction of alternative technologies, overcapacity in the worldwide supply of flash-based or similar memory components, increased manufacturing efficiencies, implementation of new manufacturing processes and expansion of manufacturing capacity by component suppliers. If we are required to decrease our prices to be competitive and are not able to offset this decrease by increases in sales volume or cost reductions, our gross margins and operating results would be adversely affected.\nWe expect to face numerous challenges as we attempt to grow our operations, channel partner relationships and end-customer base internationally.\nWe have recently begun to grow our business internationally. Through January 31, 2015, we had 140 sales and marketing employees worldwide as well as over 100 channel partners in over 30 countries. Although we expect a portion of our future revenue growth will be from channel partners and end-customers located outside of the United States, we may not be able to increase international market demand for our products.\nWe expect to face numerous challenges as we attempt to grow our operations, channel partner relationships and end-customer base internationally, including attracting and retaining distributors and resellers with international capabilities or distributors and resellers located in international markets. Our revenue and expenses could be adversely affected by a variety of factors associated with international operations, some of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulties of managing and staffing international offices, and the increased travel, infrastructure and legal compliance costs associated with international locations;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in contract enforcement;\n\u2022\nregulatory, political or economic conditions in a specific country or region;\n\u2022\ncompliance with local laws and regulations and unanticipated changes in local laws and regulations, including tax laws and regulations;\n\u2022\ncompliance with local privacy laws and regulations and unanticipated changes as country or region-specific privacy laws and regulations are enacted or expanded;\n\u2022\nexport and import controls, trade protection measures, FCPA compliance and other regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\neconomic sanctions enacted by the United States against certain countries, companies, and individuals, including those sanctions enacted in 2014 against entities located in Russia and Ukraine;\n\u2022\neffects of changes in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences;\n\u2022\nservice provider and government spending patterns;\n\u2022\nreduced protection of our intellectual property and other assets in some countries;\n\u2022\ngreater difficulty documenting and testing our internal controls;\n\u2022\ndiffering employment practices and labor issues; and\n\u2022\nacts of terrorism and international conflicts.\nWe are incurring significant increased costs as a result of operating as a public company and our management will be required to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives.\nAs a public company and particularly after we cease to be an emerging growth company, we expect to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. For example, we are now subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), and are required to comply with the applicable requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as well as rules and regulations subsequently implemented by the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange, including the establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and changes in corporate governance practices. Compliance with these requirements has increased and will continue to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and has and will increasingly make some activities more time consuming and costly. In addition, we expect that our management and other personnel will need to divert attention from operational and other business matters to devote substantial time to these public company requirements. In particular, we expect to incur significant expenses and devote substantial management effort toward ensuring compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which will increase when we are no longer an emerging growth company, as defined by the JOBS Act. We will need to hire additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge and will need to expand our internal audit function. We cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur as a result of becoming a public company or the timing of such costs.\nWe also expect that operating as a public company will make it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance on the terms that we would like. As a public company, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified people to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as executive officers.\nOur use of open source and third-party software could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products.\nWe incorporate open source software into our products. Although we monitor our use of open source software closely, we cannot guarantee that we are aware of all the open source software included in our products. Moreover, the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by courts in or outside of the United States, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to market our products. In this event, we could be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our products, to make generally available, in source code form, proprietary code that links to certain open source modules, to re-engineer our products, or to discontinue the sale of our products if re-engineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis, any of which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe also incorporate proprietary third-party technologies, including software programs, into our products. We rely on license agreements to gain access to these third-party technologies and may need to enter into additional license agreements in the future. However, licenses to relevant third-party technology may not be or remain\navailable to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Therefore, we could face delays in product releases until equivalent technology can be identified, licensed or developed, and integrated into our current products. These delays, if they occur, could materially adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe accounting method for convertible senior notes that may be settled in cash, such as the notes if stockholder approval is obtained, could have a material effect on our reported financial results.\nIn May 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued FASB Staff Position No. APB 14-1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash Upon Conversion (including Partial Cash Settlement), which has subsequently been codified as Accounting Standards Codification 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options, or ASC 470-20. ASC 470-20 requires an entity to separately account for the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments whose conversion may be settled entirely or partially in cash (such as our convertible senior notes if we obtain stockholder approval) in a manner that reflects the issuer\u2019s economic interest cost for non-convertible debt. The liability component of the notes would initially be valued at the fair value of a similar debt instrument that does not have an associated equity component and would be reflected as a liability in our consolidated balance sheet. The equity component of the notes would be included in the additional paid-in capital section of our stockholder\u2019 equity on our consolidated balance sheet, and the value of the equity component would be treated as original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component. This original issue discount would be amortized to non-cash expense over the term of the notes, and we would record a greater amount of non-cash interest expense in current periods as a result of this amortization. Accordingly, we would report lower net income in our financial results because ASC 470-20 would require the interest expense associated with the notes to include both the then current period\u2019s amortization of the debt discount and the notes\u2019 coupon interest, which could adversely affect our reported or future financial results, the trading price of our common stock and the trading price of the notes.\nIn addition, under certain circumstances, convertible debt instruments whose conversion may be settled entirely or partly in cash (such as our convertible senior notes if we obtain stockholder approval) are currently accounted for using the treasury stock method. Under this method, the shares issuable upon conversion of the notes are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share unless the conversion value of the notes exceeds their principal amount, then, for diluted earnings per share purposes, the notes are accounted for as if the number of shares of common stock that would be necessary to settle the excess, if we elected to settle the excess in shares, are issued. The accounting standards in the future may not continue to permit the use of the treasury stock method. If we are unable to use the treasury stock method in accounting for the shares, if any, issuable upon conversion of the notes, then our diluted earnings per share could be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock may be negatively affected.\nAs a public company, we are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal control. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Sarbanes-Oxley Act) requires that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and, beginning with our annual report for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015, provide a management report on the internal control over financial reporting. If we have a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, we may not detect errors on a timely basis and our financial statements may be materially misstated. If we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, if we are unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting are effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm, when required, is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the\nmarket price of our common stock could be negatively affected, and we could become subject to investigations by the stock exchange on which our securities are listed, the SEC, or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources.\nWe may acquire or make investments in other companies, each of which may divert our management\u2019s attention, and result in additional dilution to our stockholders and consumption of resources that are necessary to sustain and grow our business.\nOur business strategy may, from time to time, include acquiring other complementary products, technologies or businesses. We also may enter into strategic relationships with other businesses in order to expand our product offerings, which could involve preferred or exclusive licenses, additional channels of distribution or discount pricing or investments in other companies. Negotiating these transactions can be time-consuming, difficult and expensive, and our ability to close these transactions may be subject to third-party or governmental approvals. Consequently, we can make no assurance that these transactions, once undertaken and announced, will close. Acquisitions or investments may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. In particular, we may encounter difficulties assimilating or integrating the businesses, technologies, products, personnel or operations of the acquired companies, particularly if the key personnel of the acquired business choose not to work for us, and we may have difficulty retaining the customers of any acquired business. Acquisitions may also disrupt our ongoing business, divert our resources and require significant management attention that would otherwise be available for development of our business. Any acquisition or investment could also expose us to unknown liabilities. Moreover, we cannot assure you that we would realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition or investment. In connection with these types of transactions, we may issue additional equity securities that would dilute our stockholders, use cash that we may need in the future to operate our business, incur debt on terms unfavorable to us or that we are unable to repay, incur significant charges or substantial liabilities, encounter difficulties integrating diverse business cultures, and become subject to adverse tax consequences, substantial depreciation or deferred compensation charges. These challenges related to acquisitions or investments could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur business is subject to the risks of earthquakes and other natural catastrophic events, and to interruption by man-made problems such as computer viruses or terrorism.\nOur sales headquarters, corporate headquarters and our current contract manufacturer are located in the San Francisco Bay area, which has a heightened risk of earthquakes. We may not have adequate business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur from a significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, acts of terrorism or malicious computer viruses could cause disruptions in our or our customers\u2019 businesses or the economy as a whole. To the extent that these disruptions result in delays or cancellations of customer orders or the deployment of our products, our business, operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nOur results of operations could be affected by natural catastrophes in locations in which our customers, suppliers or contract manufacturers operate.\nSeveral of our customers, suppliers and our contract manufacturer have operations in locations that are subject to natural disasters, such as severe weather and geological events, which could disrupt the operations of those customers, suppliers and our contract manufacturer. Some of our customers and suppliers, including our sole flash memory supplier, Toshiba, are located in Japan and they have experienced, and may experience in the future, shutdowns as a result of these events, and their operations may be negatively impacted by these events. Our customers affected by a natural disaster could postpone or cancel orders of our products, which would negatively impact our business. In addition, a natural disaster could delay or prevent our contract manufacturer in the manufacture of our products, and we may need to qualify a replacement manufacturer. Moreover, should any\nof our key suppliers fail to deliver components to us as a result of a natural disaster, we may be unable to purchase these components in the necessary quantities or may be forced to purchase components in the open market at significantly higher costs. We may also be forced to purchase components in advance of our normal supply chain demand to avoid potential market shortages. In addition, if we are required to obtain one or more new suppliers for components or use alternative components in our solutions, we may need to conduct additional testing of our solutions to ensure those components meet our quality and performance standards, all of which could delay shipments to our customers and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles applicable to us.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles in the United States are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, the SEC and other bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results, and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change. In addition, the SEC has announced a multi-year plan that could ultimately lead to the use of International Financial Reporting Standards by U.S. issuers in their SEC filings. Any such change could have a significant effect on our reported financial results.\nThe conditional conversion feature of our convertible senior notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nIn the event the conditional conversion feature of our convertible senior notes is triggered, holders of the notes will be entitled to convert the notes at any time during specified periods at their option. Even if holders do not elect to convert their notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nIf our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies are based on assumptions that change or prove to be incorrect, our operating results could fall below expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in our stock price.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as described under \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in this periodic report, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our operating results may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our operating results to fall below market expectations, resulting in a decline in our stock price. Significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to revenue recognition, inventory valuation, product warranty, stock-based compensation, and deferred income tax valuation allowances.\nOur ability to use net operating losses to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\nIn general, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Internal Revenue Code, a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change net operating losses, or NOLs, to offset future taxable income. Our existing NOLs may be subject to substantial limitations arising from previous ownership changes, and if we undergo an ownership change, our ability to utilize NOLs could be further limited by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. In addition, future changes in our stock ownership, many of which are outside of our control, could result in an ownership change under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. Our net operating losses may also be impaired under state law. Accordingly, we may not be able to utilize a material portion of our NOLs.\nChanges in our provision for income taxes or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could materially and adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by the following:\n\u2022\nchanges in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;\n\u2022\nexpiration of, or lapses in, the research and development tax credits;\n\u2022\ntransfer pricing adjustments;\n\u2022\ntax effects of nondeductible compensation;\n\u2022\ntax costs related to intercompany realignments;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting principles;\n\u2022\nchanges in tax laws and regulations, including possible changes to the taxation of earnings in the United States of our foreign subsidiaries, and the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income, or the foreign tax credit rules; or\n\u2022\nearnings that are lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates.\nSignificant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attribute prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes. The accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes applies to all income tax positions, including the potential recovery of previously paid taxes, which if settled unfavorably could adversely impact our provision for income taxes or additional paid-in capital. In addition, we are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. The outcomes from these examinations may have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe are subject to governmental export and import controls that could subject us to liability or impair our ability to compete in foreign markets.\nBecause we incorporate encryption technology into our products, our products are subject to United States export controls and may be exported outside the United States only with the required level of export license or through an export license exception. In addition, various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to introduce products in those countries. Changes in our products or changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction of our products in international markets, prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our products throughout their global systems or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries altogether. Any change in export or import regulations or related legislation, shift in approach to the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, or change in the countries, persons or technologies affected by such regulations, could result in decreased use of our products by, or an inability to export or sell our products to, existing or prospective customers with international operations and harm our business. In addition, any failure by us to comply with these rules and regulations could subject us to significant fines and penalties.\nFailure to comply with governmental laws and regulations could harm our business.\nOur business is subject to regulation by various federal, state, local and foreign governmental agencies, including agencies responsible for monitoring and enforcing employment and labor laws, workplace safety, product safety, environmental laws, consumer protection laws, anti-bribery laws, import/export controls, federal securities laws and tax laws and regulations. In certain jurisdictions, these regulatory requirements may be more stringent than in the United States. Noncompliance with applicable regulations or requirements could subject us to investigations,\nsanctions, mandatory product recalls, enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, fines, damages, civil and criminal penalties or injunctions. If any governmental sanctions are imposed, or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. In addition, responding to any action will likely result in a significant diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources and an increase in professional fees. Enforcement actions and sanctions could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe are subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations pursuant to which we may incur substantial costs or liabilities, which could harm our business, operating results or financial condition.\nWe are subject to various state, federal, local and international laws and regulations relating to the environment or human health and safety, including those governing the presence of certain substances in electronic products and making producers of those products financially responsible for the collection, treatment, recycling and disposal of certain products. These laws and regulations have been enacted in several jurisdictions in which we sell our products, including the European Union, or EU, and certain of its member countries. For example, the EU has enacted the Restriction on Hazardous Substances, or RoHS, and Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment, or WEEE, directives. RoHS prohibits the use of certain substances, including lead, in certain products, including hard drives, sold after July 1, 2006. The WEEE directive obligates parties that sell electrical and electronic equipment in the EU to put a clearly identifiable mark on the equipment, register with and report to EU member countries regarding distribution of the equipment and provide a mechanism to take back and properly dispose of the equipment. There is still some uncertainty in certain EU countries as to which party involved in the manufacture, distribution and sale of electronic equipment will be ultimately responsible for registration, reporting and disposal. Similar legislation may be enacted in other locations where we sell our products. We will need to ensure that we comply with these laws and regulations as they are enacted, and that our component suppliers also comply with these laws and regulations. If we or our component suppliers fail to comply with the legislation, our customers may refuse or be unable to purchase our products, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nPursuant to such laws and regulations, we could incur substantial costs and be subject to disruptions to our operations and logistics or other liabilities. For example, if we were found to be in violation of these laws or regulations, we could be subject to governmental fines or other sanctions and liability to our customers. In addition, we have to make significant expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations. Any such costs or liabilities pursuant to environmental, health or safety laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWhile our international revenue has typically been denominated in U.S. dollars, fluctuations in currency exchange rates could cause our products to become relatively more expensive to customers in a particular country, leading to a reduction in revenue or profitability from sales in that country. We currently do not enter into hedging arrangements to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. Our exposure to foreign currency fluctuation may change over time as our business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Gains and losses on the conversion to U.S. dollars of accounts receivable and other monetary assets and liabilities arising from international operations may contribute to fluctuations in operating results.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur stock price may be volatile. Further, you may not be able to resell shares of our common stock at or above the price you paid.\nOur common stock is currently traded on the New York Stock Exchange, but we can provide no assurance that there will be active trading on that market or any other market in the future. If there is not an active trading\nmarket or if the volume of trading is limited, the price of our common stock could decline and holders of our common stock may have difficulty selling their shares. In addition, the trading price of our common stock may be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. For example, since our shares were sold in our IPO in September 2013 at $9.00 per share, our stock price has ranged from $2.50 to $7.98 per share through March 25, 2015. Some of the factors affecting our volatility include:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variation in our and our competitors\u2019 results of operations;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of new products, new or terminated significant contracts, commercial relationships or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nissuance of new securities analysts\u2019 reports or changed recommendations for our stock;\n\u2022\ndevelopments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights;\n\u2022\ncommencement of, or our involvement in litigation;\n\u2022\nannounced or completed acquisitions of businesses or technologies by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nany major change in our management; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions and slow or negative growth of our markets.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and the market for technology companies in particular, has experienced and may continue to experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. Broad market and industry factors may seriously affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. These fluctuations may be even more pronounced in the trading market for our stock during the period following our recently completed public offering. In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources.\nWe have been named as a defendant in a putative securities class action law suit. This, and other litigation, could cause us to incur substantial costs and divert our attention and resources.\nIn the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. Companies such as ours in the high technology industry are particularly vulnerable to this kind of litigation due to the high volatility of their stock prices. We and a number of our current and former officers and directors and others are defendants in putative class and derivative action litigation, which is discussed below in the Section entitled \u201cLegal Proceedings.\u201d Any litigation to which we are a party may result in the diversion of management attention and resources from our business and business goals. In addition, any litigation to which we are a party may result in an onerous or unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal and that may require us to make payments of substantial monetary damages or fines, or we may decide to settle lawsuits on similarly unfavorable terms, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf securities or industry analysts issue an adverse opinion regarding our stock or do not publish research or reports about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that equity research analysts publish about us and our business. We do not control these analysts or the content and opinions included in their reports. The price of our common stock has declined and could decline again when one or more equity analysts downgrade our common stock or when those analysts issue other unfavorable commentary or cease publishing reports about us or our business. If one or more equity research analyst ceases coverage of our\ncompany, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline. Further, securities analysts may elect not to provide research coverage of our common stock, and such lack of research coverage may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe issuance of our convertible senior notes could affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe market price of our common stock could be adversely affected by possible sales of common stock by investors who view our convertible senior notes as an attractive means of equity participation in us and by hedging or arbitrage activity involving our common stock.\nConversion of our convertible senior notes may affect the market price of our common stock.\nIf we do not obtain stockholder approval and satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering shares of common stock, or if we obtain stockholder approval and elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by paying cash and delivering shares of common stock, the issuance of additional shares will dilute the ownership of stockholders. In addition, any sales in the public market of shares of common stock that we issue upon conversion could adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nCertain provisions in the indenture governing our convertible senior notes could delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover or other takeover attempt of us.\nCertain provisions in our convertible senior notes and the indenture could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us. For example, if a takeover would constitute a fundamental change, holders of the notes will have the right to require us to repurchase their notes in cash. In addition, if a takeover constitutes a make-whole fundamental change, we may be required to increase the conversion rate for holders who convert their notes in connection with such takeover. In either case, and in other cases, our obligations under the notes and the indenture could increase the cost of acquiring us or otherwise discourage a third party from acquiring us or removing incumbent management.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control and may affect the trading price of our common stock.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws include provisions that:\n\u2022\nauthorize our board of directors to issue, without further action by the stockholders, up to 10,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock;\n\u2022\nrequire that any action to be taken by our stockholders be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting and not by written consent;\n\u2022\nspecify that special meetings of our stockholders can be called only by our board of directors or the chief executive officer;\n\u2022\nestablish an advance notice procedure for stockholder approvals to be brought before an annual meeting of our stockholders, including proposed nominations of persons for election to our board of directors;\n\u2022\nestablish that our board of directors is divided into three classes, Class I, Class II and Class III, with each class serving staggered terms;\n\u2022\nprovide that our directors may be removed only for cause;\n\u2022\nprovide that vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum;\n\u2022\nspecify that no stockholder is permitted to cumulate votes at any election of directors; and\n\u2022\nrequire a super-majority of votes to amend certain of the above-mentioned provisions.\nIn addition, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law regulating corporate takeovers. Section 203 generally prohibits us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder subject to certain exceptions.\nWe have never paid dividends on our capital stock, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have not paid cash dividends on any of our classes of capital stock to date, have contractual restrictions against paying cash dividends, and currently intend to retain our future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock would be the sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.", "PERMNO": 14143, "SIC": 3572, "TIC": "VMEMQ"}
