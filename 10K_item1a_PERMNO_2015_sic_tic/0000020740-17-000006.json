{"cik": "20740", "company": "CLARCOR INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-01-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nOur business faces a variety of risks. These risks include those described below and may include additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial. If any of the events or circumstances described in the following risk factors occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected, and the trading price of our Common Stock could decline. These risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information in this 2016 Form 10-K.\nThe first section of the risk factors below, \u201cRisks Related to our Business,\u201d sets forth risks faced by us as a standalone company and should be read in conjunction with the second section of the risk factors below, \u201cRisks Related to the Pending Parker-Hannifin Transaction,\u201d which sets forth risks we currently face in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Parker-Hannifin merger agreement.\nRisks Related to our Business\nOur business is affected by the health of the markets we serve.\nOur financial performance depends, in large part, on varying conditions in the markets that we serve, particularly the general industrial market, the trucking market, and the energy market. Demand in the markets we serve fluctuates in response to overall economic conditions, although the replacement nature of our aftermarket products may help to mitigate the effects of these changes, particularly in our Engine/Mobile Filtration segment. In addition, a general economic downturn may have an adverse effect on sales of more expensive filtration systems and products, such as capital equipment sold by our PECOFacet division (which may be affected by, among other things, a decrease in the cost of oil and natural gas), CLARCOR Engine Mobile Solutions (which may be affected by, among other things, a decrease in the OEM market for heavy-duty engines, particularly in the agricultural sector) and CLARCOR Industrial Air (which may be affected by, among other things, a decrease in gas turbine system sales). An economic downturn in the markets we serve may result in reductions in sales and pricing of our products and an increase in the difficulty of collecting accounts receivable and the risk of excess and obsolete inventories, which could have a material adverse effect on our potential earnings and future results of operations.\nAdditionally, a prolonged depression in the price of oil and natural gas would likely continue to negatively impact several of our key business units, including our PECOFacet division and certain of our other subsidiaries that sell products used in the exploration, extraction, storage and transmission of oil and natural gas. Depending on the length and extent of such depression, this could have a material adverse effect on our potential earnings and future results of operations.\nAdverse U.S. and global economic conditions could materially and negatively affect our revenues, profitability and results of operations.\nOur business depends on the strength of economies in various parts of the world, primarily in North America, but increasingly in Europe and China, and negative economic conditions in these economies could adversely impact our earnings in any particular period.\nAlthough the U.S. economy has improved in recent years, challenging macroeconomic conditions in the U.S. adversely affected our business in fiscal 2016, and the U.S. continues to face near term challenges such as excessive federal and state government debt and regulatory uncertainty.\nOur business was also adversely impacted in fiscal 2016 by ongoing stagnant global macroeonomic conditions. Moreover, declining or relatively flat growth persists in certain economic regions in which we conduct substantial operations, including in various member-states of the European Union. The continued effects of the global economic stagnation may continue to have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition, and on the general economic activity in many of the industries and markets in which we and our distributors, customers and suppliers operate. We cannot predict changes in worldwide or regional economic conditions, as such conditions may be volatile and are beyond our control. If these conditions persist or deteriorate, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nWhile our current China sales are significantly less than either our U.S. or European sales, we anticipate China becoming more economically and strategically important to our business over time. If China experiences slowed or even negative economic growth, this would adversely impact our business there, as most of the sales we make in China are for domestic Chinese consumption and not for export. In addition, if adverse economic conditions in China were to cause a reduction of the level of infrastructure projects and lower diesel engine manufacturing volume in the country, this would likely have a negative effect on our Engine/Mobile Filtration segment sales there. This is because most of our current Engine/Mobile Filtration sales in China are to OEMs that make large diesel engines for heavy-duty equipment, which are used in such infrastructure projects.\nWe are subject to foreign currency exchange rate and other related risks.\nWe conduct operations in many areas of the world involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies. We are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues. In addition, since our financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, changes in foreign currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our results of operations. The U.S. dollar has strengthened in recent years and has resulted in material unfavorable impacts on our financial statements. If the\nU.S. dollar continues to strengthen against other currencies, we will continue to experience additional unfavorable impacts to our financial statements.\nThere can be no assurance that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, while the use of currency hedging instruments may provide us with some protection from adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We also face risks arising from the imposition of foreign exchange controls and currency devaluations. Foreign exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into U.S. dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls. Currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation.\nWe face customer concentration issues in certain geographic locations and/or in respect of certain of our businesses.\nAlthough we serve a diverse customer base across the totality of our business, we do face customer concentration in certain geographic locations and in certain end-markets. For example, the majority of our Engine/Mobile Filtration segment sales in China are predominantly to a relatively small number of OEMs, including most notably Weichai Power Co. Ltd., a large Chinese diesel engine and truck manufacturer (\u201cWeichai\u201d). Our growth in China, a strategically important and potentially high growth market, currently depends in part on our ability to maintain a good and growing commercial relationship with Weichai and the other OEMs. If we are unsuccessful in this regard, this could have a material adverse effect on our potential earnings and future results of operations, and could significantly diminish the opportunities and growth in China for our Engine/Mobile Filtration segment.\nSimilarly, a significant percentage of the sales of the division of our Engine/Mobile Filtration segment that focuses on OEM customers, are to a relatively small number of OEMs, or to other filter companies servicing the OEM market, and a significant percentage of the sales of gas turbine inlet systems and filters by our CLARCOR Industrial Air division, which is part of our Industrial/Environmental Filtration segment, are to divisions of General Electric Company (\u201cGE\u201d), including under our strategic supply partnership with GE described below. The success of these businesses currently depends in part on our ability to maintain a good and growing commercial relationship with the aforementioned customers. If we are unsuccessful in this regard, this could have a material adverse effect on our potential earnings and future results of operations.\nOur CLARCOR Industrial Air division is committed to significant efforts under its supply and development agreements with GE and we may be unable to receive the anticipated benefits under these agreements.\nIn September 2016, we, through our CLARCOR Industrial Air division, entered into certain agreements with GE, including (i) two supply agreements pursuant to which we will supply filters and all of the other key internal components (known as \u201cSmartParts\u201d) for the air inlet filtration systems of various GE\u2019s gas turbine platforms (which agreements have ten year terms, subject to early termination under certain circumstances) and (ii) a development agreement pursuant to which we will work to develop a next-generation air inlet filtration system for GE\u2019s \u201cH-Class\u201d advanced technology gas turbine platform (the \u201cNew System\u201d). Under one of the supply agreements, GE will purchase 100% of its requirements of filters and SmartParts for its \u201cH-Class\u201d advanced technology gas turbines from us, which we will supply at substantial price discounts for a limited period of time (anticipated not to exceed four years). We may be unable to receive the anticipated benefits under these agreements, including as the result of any early termination of the supply agreements by GE, our and GE\u2019s respective ability to develop the New System at a reasonable cost or at all, our and GE\u2019s respective ability to commercially launch the New System, our expectations regarding H-Class turbine adoption rates and GE\u2019s anticipated share of the advanced technology turbine market, our relationship with GE and the level of support that GE provides to us in connection with these agreements, and our ability to develop or retain ownership of intellectual property.\nWe face heightened legal challenges from our competitors with respect to intellectual property, particularly in the area of patents.\nWe face increasing exposure to claims by others for infringement of intellectual property rights, particularly with respect to patents, which claims could result in significant costs or losses. This is especially important with respect to our Engine/Mobile Filtration segment, where many of our competitors are suppliers of \u201cfirst-fit\u201d products to OEMs and seek to control or at least gain an advantage in the aftermarket through aggressive and comprehensive patent strategies, sometimes in conjunction with the OEMs. These strategies may involve attempting to obtain as many patents as possible, including particularly with respect to the systems for attaching or sealing filters to their respective housings, deliberately delaying the final issuance of patents so as to be able to modify them in response to competitive product designs, and seeking multiple \u201ccontinuations\u201d of their patents in an attempt to have their patents more clearly apply to competitive product designs.\nThis increased exposure to patent claims is also becoming more relevant to our Industrial/Environmental Filtration segment, where we face sophisticated competitors that are larger and have greater financial resources than we do and that have complex patent portfolios that present potential obstacles to our growth.\nWhile we spend (and intend to continue to spend) significant resources to combat these risks, including by understanding the patent landscape applicable to our operating companies, creating alternative products and product designs that fall outside of our competitors\u2019 claimed patent rights, challenging patents which we believe to be invalid and attempting to build our own patent portfolio, there can be no guarantee that we will be successful. Any such failure could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or business prospects.\nWe face heightened legal challenges with respect to protecting our own intellectual property, particularly overseas.\nWe have developed and actively pursue developing proprietary technology in the industries in which we operate, and rely on intellectual property laws and a number of patents to protect such technology. In doing so, we incur ongoing costs to enforce and defend our intellectual property. Despite our efforts in this regard, we may face situations where our own intellectual property rights are ignored, invalidated or circumvented, to our material detriment. This is of particular concern in China, where we anticipate the market for our products to develop substantially, and, with it, the incentive of third parties to infringe or challenge our intellectual property rights.\nWe could be adversely impacted by environmental matters and climate change and energy legislation and regulation.\nOur operations are subject to U.S. and non-U.S. environmental laws and regulations governing emissions to air; discharges to water; the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste materials; and the cleanup of contaminated properties. In this regard, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and/or other responsible state agencies have designated us as a potentially responsible party, along with other companies, in remedial activities for the cleanup of waste sites under the federal Superfund statute. Currently, we believe that any potential environmental liabilities with respect to our former or existing operations are not material, but there is no assurance that we will not be adversely impacted by such liabilities, costs or claims in the future, either under present laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future. In addition, environmental and related remediation costs are difficult to quantify for a number of reasons, including the number of parties involved, the difficulty in determining the nature and extent of the contamination at issue, the length of time remediation may require, the complexity of the environmental regulation, the continuing advancement of remediation technology, and the potential imposition of joint and several liability on each potentially responsible party for the cleanup.\nForeign, federal, state and local regulatory and legislative bodies have proposed various legislative and regulatory measures relating to climate change, regulating greenhouse gas emissions and energy policies. Due to the uncertainty in the regulatory and legislative processes, as well as the scope of such requirements and initiatives, we cannot currently determine the effect such legislation and regulation may have on our operations.\nThe potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are also highly uncertain and would vary depending on type of physical impact and geographic location. Climate change physical impacts could include changing temperatures, water shortages, changes in weather and rainfall patterns, and changing storm patterns and intensities. The occurrence of one or more natural disasters, whether due to climate change or naturally occurring, such as tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes and other forms of severe weather in the U.S. or in a country in which we operate or in which our suppliers or customers are located could adversely impact our operations and financial performance. Such events could result in:\n\u2022physical damage to and complete or partial closure of one or more of our manufacturing facilities;\n\u2022temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of raw materials from our suppliers;\n\u2022disruption in the transport of our products to customers and end users; and/or\n\u2022delay in the delivery of our products to our customers.\nOur operations outside of the United States are subject to political, investment and local business risks.\nApproximately 32% of our fiscal 2016 sales resulted from exports to countries outside of the United States and from sales by our foreign business units. As part of our business strategy, we expect to expand our international operations through internal growth. Sales and operations outside of the United States, particularly in emerging markets, are subject to a variety of risks which are different from or additional to the risks the Company faces within the United States. Risks of doing business internationally include, among others:\n\u2022local economic, political and social conditions, including potential hyper-inflationary conditions and political instability\nin certain countries;\n\u2022the impact on our business and results of operations from developments related to the potential exit of the United\nKingdom from the European Union following the U.K. referendum held in June 2016;\n\u2022imposition of limitations on the remittance of dividends and payments by foreign subsidiaries;\n\u2022adverse currency exchange rate fluctuations, including significant devaluations of currencies;\n\u2022tax-related risks, including the imposition of taxes and the lack of beneficial treaties, which result in a higher effective\ntax rate for the Company;\n\u2022difficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems;\n\u2022domestic and foreign customs, tariffs and quotas or other trade barriers or restrictions;\n\u2022credit risk of local customers and distributors;\n\u2022increased costs for transportation and shipping;\n\u2022difficulties in protecting intellectual property;\n\u2022increased risk of corruption, self-dealing or other unethical practices that may be difficult to detect or remedy;\n\u2022risk of nationalization of private enterprises by foreign governments;\n\u2022managing and obtaining support and distribution channels for overseas operations;\n\u2022hiring and retaining qualified management personnel for our overseas operations;\n\u2022imposition or increase of restrictions on investment; and\n\u2022required compliance with a variety of local laws and regulations which may be materially different than those to which\nwe are subject in the United States.\nAs we continue to operate our business globally, our success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other related risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our international operations or on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face significant competition in the markets we serve.\nThe markets in which we operate are highly competitive and highly fragmented. We compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products. Our products primarily compete on the basis of price, performance, speed of delivery, quality and customer support. Some of our competitors are companies, divisions or operating units of companies, that have greater financial and other resources than we do. In addition, large customers continue to seek productivity gains and lower prices from us and their other suppliers. We may lose business or our margins may be negatively impacted if we are unable to deliver the best value to our customers. Any failure by us to compete effectively in the markets we serve could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIncreasing costs for manufactured components, raw materials, transportation, energy and health care prices may adversely affect our profitability.\nWe use a broad range of manufactured components and raw materials in our products, including steel, steel-related components, filtration media, adhesives, plastics, paper and packaging materials. Components and materials comprise the largest component of our costs. Increases in the price of these items could further materially increase our operating costs and materially and adversely affect our profit margins. Similarly, transportation, energy and health care costs have risen steadily over the past few years and represent an increasingly significant expense for the Company. Although we try to contain these costs wherever possible, and although we have historically been able to pass most increased costs in the form of price increases to our customers, we may be unsuccessful in doing so for competitive reasons, and even when successful, the timing of such price increases may lag significantly behind our incurrence of higher costs.\nOur manufacturing operations are dependent upon third-party suppliers.\nWe obtain materials and manufactured components from third-party suppliers, and these suppliers, in turn, rely on other suppliers for raw materials and sub-components of the products they supply to us. Although the majority of the materials and components that we purchase can be obtained from multiple sources, this is not always the case, and even when such re-sourcing is possible, it may result in delays and increased costs to us. Any delay or disruption in the supply chain that provides us with necessary materials and components may affect our ability to manufacture or supply products to our customers or to do so in a timely fashion. Delays or inability to obtain supplies may result from a number of factors affecting our suppliers, including unavailability of raw materials, capacity constraints, labor disputes, the impaired financial condition of a particular supplier, suppliers\u2019 allocations to other purchasers, weather emergencies or acts of war or terrorism. Any delay in receiving supplies could impair our ability to deliver products to our customers and, accordingly, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, if we are forced to seek alternative sources of raw materials or components, this may require us to qualify the products into which such materials and components are incorporated. Such qualification can be time consuming, costly and may not be successful. In such case, we may be unable to offer the affected products to our customers\nor be unable to supply the affected products at a profit, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nOur success depends in part on our development of new and improved products, and we may fail to meet the needs of customers on a timely or cost-effective basis.\nOur continued success depends on our ability to maintain technological capabilities, machinery and knowledge necessary to adapt to changing market demands as well as to develop and commercialize innovative products, such as innovative filtration media and higher efficiency filtration systems. We may not be able to develop new products as successfully as in the past or be able to keep pace with technological developments by our competitors and the industry generally. In addition, we may develop specific technologies and capabilities in anticipation of customers\u2019 demands for new innovations and technologies. If such demand does not materialize, we may be unable to recover the costs incurred in such programs. If we are unable to recover these costs or if any such programs do not progress as expected, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nThe introduction of new and improved products and services could reduce our future sales.\nSubstantial changes or technological developments in the industries in which our products are used could reduce sales if these changes negatively impact the need for our products. For example, improvements in engine technology may reduce the need to make periodic filter changes and thus negatively impact our aftermarket filter sales for such engines.\nOur ability to operate effectively could be impaired if we fail to attract and retain key personnel.\nOur ability to operate our business and implement our strategies depends, in part, on the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees. Our management philosophy of cost-control means that we operate what we consider to be a very lean company with respect to personnel, and our commitment to a less centralized organization (discussed further below) also places greater emphasis on the strength of local management. Our future success will depend on, among other factors, our ability to attract and retain other qualified personnel, particularly management, research and development engineers and technical sales professionals. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees or the failure to attract or retain other qualified personnel, domestically or abroad, could have a material adverse effect on our business or business prospects.\nOur recent acquisitions may be unsuccessful.\nAcquisitions, including our recent acquisitions of the Bekaert Business, CLARCOR Industrial Air, the Stanadyne Business, Filter Resources, TDC and FibeRio, involve a number of special risks and factors, such as:\n\u2022the focus of management\u2019s attention to the assimilation of the acquired companies and their employees and on the\nmanagement of expanding operations;\n\u2022the incorporation of acquired products into our product line;\n\u2022the increasing demands on our operational and information technology systems;\n\u2022potentially insufficient internal controls over financial activities or financial reporting at an acquired company that could\nimpact us on a consolidated basis;\n\u2022the failure to realize expected synergies;\n\u2022the potential loss of customers and other material business relations as a result of changes in control;\n\u2022the possibility that we have acquired substantial contingent or unanticipated legal liabilities; and\n\u2022the loss of key employees of the acquired businesses.\nAlthough we conduct what we believe to be a prudent level of investigation regarding the operating and financial condition of the businesses we purchase, an unavoidable level of risk remains regarding the actual operating condition of these businesses. Until we actually assume operating control of these business assets and their operations, we may not be able to fully ascertain the actual value or understand the potential liabilities of the acquired entities and their operations. This is particularly true with respect to non-U.S. acquisitions.\nWe are a decentralized company, which presents certain risks.\nThe Company is relatively decentralized in comparison with its peers. While we believe this practice has catalyzed our growth and enabled us to remain responsive to opportunities and to our customers\u2019 needs, it necessarily places significant control and decision-making powers in the hands of local management. This presents various risks, including the risk that we may be slower or less able to identify or react to problems affecting a key business than we would in a more centralized environment. In addition, it means that we may be slower to detect compliance related problems (e.g., a rogue employee undertaking activities that are\nprohibited by applicable law or by our internal policies) and that \u201ccompany-wide\u201d business initiatives, such as the integration of disparate information technology systems, are often more challenging and costly to implement, and their risk of failure higher, than they would be in a more centralized environment. Depending on the nature of the problem or initiative in question, such failure could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur business operations may be adversely affected by information systems interruptions or intrusions.\nWe are dependent on various information technologies throughout our company to administer, store and support multiple business activities. If these systems are damaged, cease to function properly, or are subject to cyber-security attacks, such as those involving unauthorized access, malicious software and/or other intrusions, we could experience production downtimes, operational delays, other detrimental impacts on our operations or ability to provide products and services to our customers, the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our systems or networks, financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability, and/or damage to our reputation. While we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures, including technical security controls, employee training, comprehensive monitoring of our networks and systems, and maintenance of backup and protective systems, our systems, networks, products and services remain potentially vulnerable to known or unknown threats, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may be subject to product liability risks.\nThe Company\u2019s businesses expose it to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture and sale of its products and the products of third-party vendors that the Company uses or resells. Significant product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. Although the Company currently maintains what it believes to be suitable and adequate product liability insurance, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to maintain its insurance on acceptable terms or that its insurance will provide adequate protection against all potential liabilities.\nOur global operations are subject to laws and regulations that impose significant compliance costs and create reputational and legal risk.\nDue to the international scope of our operations, we are subject to a complex system of commercial and trade regulations around the world, and our foreign operations are governed by laws, rules and business practices that often differ from those of the U.S. We cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted, which could have a material and negative impact on our business and our results of operation. For example, recent years have seen an increase in the development and enforcement of laws regarding trade compliance and anti-corruption, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws in other countries. While we maintain a variety of internal policies and controls and take steps, including periodic training and internal audits, that we believe are reasonably calculated to discourage, prevent and detect violations of such laws, we cannot guarantee that such actions will be effective or sufficient or that individual employees will not engage in inappropriate behavior in contravention of our policies and instructions. Such conduct, or even the allegation thereof, could result in costly investigations and the imposition of severe criminal or civil sanctions, could disrupt our business, and could materially and adversely affect our reputation, business and results of operations or financial condition.\nThe Company may be subject to risks relating to changes in its tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities.\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the United States and various non-U.S. jurisdictions. Domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. The Company\u2019s effective tax rate could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings among countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws or regulations. The amount of income taxes paid is subject to regular audits by United States federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-U.S. tax authorities. If these audits result in assessments different from amounts reserved, future financial results may include unfavorable adjustments to the Company\u2019s tax liabilities, which could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations and liquidity.\nWe face certain risks associated with potential labor disruptions.\nSome of our employees around the world are covered by collective bargaining agreements and/or are represented by unions or workers' councils. While we believe that our relations with our employees are generally good, we cannot provide assurances that the Company will be completely free of labor disruptions such as work stoppages, work slowdowns, union organizing campaigns, strikes, lockouts or that any existing labor disruption will be favorably resolved. We could incur additional costs and/\nor experience work stoppages that could adversely affect our business operations through a loss of revenue and strained relationships with customers.\nChanges in our product mix impact our financial performance.\nWe sell products that have varying profit margins. Our financial performance can be impacted depending on the mix of products we sell during a given period. Our outlook assumes a certain geographic mix of sales as well as a product mix of sales. If actual results vary from this projected geographic and product mix of sales, our results could be negatively impacted.\nWe face the challenge of accurately aligning our capacity with our demand.\nWe can experience capacity constraints and longer lead times for certain products in times of growing demand while we can also experience idle capacity as economies slow or demand for certain products decline. Accurately forecasting our expected volumes and appropriately adjusting our capacity have been, and will continue to be, important factors in determining our results of operations. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to increase manufacturing capacity to a level that meets demand for our products, which could prevent us from meeting increased customer demand and could harm our business. However, if we overestimate our demand and overbuild our capacity, we may have significantly underutilized assets and we may experience reduced margins. If we do not accurately align our manufacturing capabilities with demand, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur cost savings and restructuring initiatives could have adverse effects on our business.\nOur ongoing cost savings and restructuring initiatives reduce our available talent, assets and other resources and could slow improvements in our products and services, adversely affect our ability to respond to customers and limit our ability to increase production quickly if demand for our products increases. In addition, the costs associated with any such cost reduction initiatives may be greater than anticipated, and we may be unable to realize anticipated cost savings or other contemplated benefits. Finally, we may delay or otherwise elect to put certain of our strategic cost savings initiatives on hold pending the completion of the Parker-Hannifin transaction. Any of the circumstances described above could adversely impact our business.\nRisks Related to the Pending Parker-Hannifin transaction\nThe pending Parker-Hannifin transaction may not be completed on a timely basis, or at all, and the failure to complete the merger could adversely affect our business, financial results and stock price.\nWe can provide no assurance that the pending Parker-Hannifin transaction will be consummated or consummated on a timely basis. The merger is subject to a number of conditions, including the approval of our stockholders and receipt of specified required regulatory approvals, which are not within our control. There can be no assurance as to when, or if, the conditions to closing of the merger will be satisfied or waived or that other events will not intervene to delay the merger or result in the termination of the Parker-Hannifin merger agreement, including as the result of the possibility that a governmental entity may prohibit, delay or refuse to grant a necessary regulatory approval in connection with the proposed transaction.\nAny failure to complete the merger could have a negative impact on our business, financial results and stock price, as well as on our relationships with our customers, suppliers and employees. In addition, if the Parker-Hannifin merger agreement is terminated, in certain circumstances, we may be required to pay Parker-Hannifiin a termination fee of $113.0 million.\nOur business and financial results could be adversely impacted during the pendency of the merger, particularly if there is a delay in the completion of the merger.\nThe pending Parker-Hannifin transaction may cause disruptions to our business or business relationships and create uncertainty surrounding our ongoing business operations, which could materially and adversely impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition, regardless of whether the merger is completed, including as a result of the following (all of which could be exacerbated by a delay in completion of the merger):\n\u2022the attention of our management may be directed to transaction-related considerations and may be diverted from the day\nto-day operations of our business;\n\u2022our employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with us, which may adversely affect our ability to\nhire, retain and motivate key personnel and other employees;\n\u2022customers, suppliers or other parties which we maintain business relationships may experience uncertainty prior to the\nclosing of the merger and seek alternative relationships with third parties or seek to terminate or renegotiate their\nrelationships with us; and\n\u2022\nthe Parker-Hannifin merger agreement restricts us from engaging in certain actions without the consent of Parker-Hannifin, which could prevent us from pursuing business opportunities that may arise prior to the consummation of the merger.\nIn addition, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant costs, expenses, and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the pending Parker-Hannifin transaction, and many of these fees and costs are payable by us regardless of whether or not the merger is consummated.", "PERMNO": 23975, "SIC": 3564, "TIC": "CLC"}
