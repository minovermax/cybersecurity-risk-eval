{"cik": "931015", "company": "POLARIS INDUSTRIES INC/MN", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-02-14", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following are significant factors known to us that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows, or operating results, as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock.\nA significant adverse determination in any material litigation claim against us could adversely affect our operating results or financial condition.\nThe manufacture, sale and usage of our products expose us to significant risks associated with product liability claims. If our products are defective or used incorrectly by our customers, bodily injury, property damage or other injury, including death, may result and this could give rise to product liability or economic loss claims against us or adversely affect our brand image or reputation. Any losses that we may suffer from any such claims, and the effect that any such liability may have upon the reputation and marketability of our products, may have a negative impact on our business and operating results.\nBecause of the high cost of product liability insurance premiums and the historically insignificant amount of product liability claims paid by us, we were self-insured from 1985 to 1996 and from 2002 to 2012. From 1996 to 2002, and beginning again in 2012, we purchased excess insurance coverage for catastrophic product liability claims for incidents occurring subsequent to the policy date that exceeded our self-insured retention levels. The estimated costs resulting from any losses are charged to expense when it is probable a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably determinable.\nWe had a product liability reserve accrued on our balance sheet of $52.8 million at December 31, 2018 for the probable payment of pending claims related to product liability litigation associated with our products. We believe such accrual is adequate. We do not believe the outcome of any pending product liability litigation will have a material adverse effect on our operations. However, no assurance can be given that our historical claims record, which has not resulted in any material adverse effects on our financial statements, will not change or that material product liability claims against us will not be made in the future. Adverse determination of material product liability claims made against us would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nSignificant product repair and/or replacement costs due to product warranty claims or product recalls could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWe provide limited warranties for our vehicles. We may also provide longer warranties related to certain promotional programs, as well as longer warranties in certain geographical markets as determined by local regulations and market conditions. We also provide a limited emission warranty for certain emission-related parts in our ORVs, snowmobiles, and motorcycles as required by the EPA and CARB. Although we employ quality control procedures, sometimes a product is distributed that needs repair or replacement. Our standard warranties require us or our dealers to repair or replace defective products during such warranty periods at no cost to the consumer.\nHistorically, product recalls have been administered through our dealers and distributors. The repair and replacement costs we could incur in connection with a recall could adversely affect our business. For example, in 2018 we voluntarily initiated product campaigns, including service bulletins, safety-related recalls, and emissions actions. In addition, product recalls could harm our reputation and cause us to lose customers, particularly if recalls cause consumers to question the safety or reliability of our products.\nOur business may be sensitive to economic conditions, including those that impact consumer spending.\nOur results of operations may be sensitive to changes in overall economic conditions, primarily in North America and Europe, that impact consumer spending, including discretionary spending. Weakening of, and fluctuations in, economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as employment levels, business conditions, changes in housing market conditions, capital markets, tax rates, savings rates, interest rates, fuel and energy costs, the impacts of natural disasters and acts of terrorism and other matters, including the availability of consumer credit, could reduce overall consumer spending or reduce consumer spending on powersports and aftermarket products. A general reduction in consumer spending or a reduction in consumer spending on powersports, boats and aftermarket products could adversely affect our sales growth and profitability. Overall demand for products sold in the Jeep and truck aftermarket is dependent upon many factors including the total number of vehicle miles driven in the United States, the total number of registered vehicles in the United States, the age and quality of these registered vehicles and the level of unemployment in the United States. Adverse changes in these factors could lead to a decreased level of demand for our products, which could negatively impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIn addition, we have financial services partnership arrangements with subsidiaries of Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and TCF Financial Corporation that require us to repurchase products financed and repossessed by the partnership, subject to certain limitations. For calendar year 2018, our maximum aggregate repurchase obligation was approximately $366.6 million. If adverse changes to economic conditions result in increased defaults on the loans made by this financial services partnership, our repurchase obligation under the partnership arrangement could adversely affect our liquidity and harm our business.\nTermination or interruption of informal supply arrangements could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nWe have informal supply arrangements with many of our suppliers. In the event of a termination of the supply arrangement, there can be no assurance that alternate supply arrangements will be made on satisfactory terms. If we need to enter into supply arrangements on unsatisfactory terms, or if there are any delays to our supply arrangements, it could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nIncreases in the cost of raw material, commodity and transportation costs and shortages of certain raw materials could negatively impact our business.\nThe primary commodities used in manufacturing our products are aluminum, steel, petroleum-based resins and certain rare earth metals used in our charging systems, as well as diesel fuel to transport the products. Our profitability is affected by significant fluctuations in the prices of the raw materials and commodities we use in our products. Additionally, the current political landscape has introduced significant uncertainty with respect to future trade regulations and existing international trade agreements. The U.S. has initiated tariffs on certain foreign goods, including raw materials, commodities, and products manufactured outside the United States that are used in our manufacturing processes, which has increased our cost of sales. In response, certain foreign governments have imposed tariffs on certain U.S. goods, and are considering imposing additional tariffs on other U.S. goods, including goods that we sell internationally. The tariffs imposed to date, the possibility of additional retaliatory trade actions stemming from these tariffs, and the potential negative outcome of the U.S. Government\u2019s section 232 investigation regarding automobiles and automobile parts could continue to increase our cost of sales, both directly and as a result of price increases implemented by domestic suppliers, which we may not be able to pass on to our customers. The impact from these tariffs could also result in decreased demand for our products or restructuring actions that could impact our work force and/or our investments in research and development or other growth initiatives. All of these could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could result in declines in our reported sales and net earnings.\nThe changing relationships of the United States dollar to the Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, the Euro, the Swiss franc, the Mexican peso, and certain other foreign currencies have from time to time had a negative impact on our results of operations. Fluctuations in the value of the United States dollar relative to these foreign currencies can adversely affect the price of our products in foreign markets, the costs we incur to import certain components for our products, and the translation of our foreign balance sheets. While we actively manage our exposure to fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates by entering into foreign exchange hedging contracts from time to time, these contracts hedge foreign currency denominated transactions, and any change in the fair value of the contracts would be offset by changes in the underlying value of the transactions being hedged.\nWe face intense competition in all product lines, including from some competitors that have greater financial and marketing resources. Failure to compete effectively against competitors could negatively impact our business and operating results.\nThe markets we operate in are highly competitive. Competition in such markets is based upon a number of factors, including price, quality, reliability, styling, product features and warranties. At the dealer level, competition is based on a number of factors, including sales and marketing support programs (such as financing and cooperative advertising). Certain of our competitors are more diversified and have financial and marketing resources that are substantially greater than ours, which allow these competitors to invest more heavily in intellectual property, product development and advertising. If we are not able to compete with new or enhanced products or models of our competitors, our future business performance may be materially and adversely affected. Internationally, our products typically face more competition where certain foreign competitors manufacture and market products in their respective countries. This allows those competitors to sell products at lower prices, which could adversely affect our competitiveness. In addition, our products compete with many other recreational products for the discretionary spending of consumers and, to a lesser\nextent, with other vehicles designed for utility applications. A failure to effectively compete with these other competitors could have a material adverse effect on our performance.\nWe manufacture our products at, and distribute our products from, several locations in North America and internationally. Any disruption at any of these facilities or manufacturing delays could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe manufacture most of our products at 19 locations, including North American and international facilities. We also have several locations that serve as wholegoods and PG&A distribution centers, warehouses and office facilities. In addition, we have agreements with other third-party manufacturers to manufacture products on our behalf. These facilities may be affected by natural or man-made disasters and other external events, including operational and logistical manufacturing execution. In the event that one of our manufacturing facilities was affected by a disaster or other event, we could be forced to shift production to one of our other manufacturing facilities. Although we maintain insurance for damage to our property and disruption of our business from casualties, such insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses. Any disruption in our manufacturing capacity could have an adverse impact on our ability to produce sufficient inventory of our products or may require us to incur additional expenses in order to produce sufficient inventory, and therefore, may adversely affect our net sales and operating results. Any disruption or delay at our manufacturing facilities could impair our ability to meet the demands of our customers, and our customers may cancel orders or purchase products from our competitors, which could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nIf we are unable to continue to enhance existing products and develop and market new or enhanced products that respond to customer needs and preferences, we may experience a decrease in demand for our products and our business could suffer.\nOne of our growth strategies is to develop innovative, customer-valued products to generate revenue growth. Our sales from new products in the past have represented a significant component of our sales and are expected to continue to represent a significant component of our future sales. We may not be able to compete as effectively with our competitors, and ultimately satisfy the needs and preferences of our customers, unless we can continue to enhance existing products and develop new innovative products in the global markets in which we compete. Product development requires significant financial, technological and other resources. While we expended $259.7 million, $238.3 million and $185.1 million for research and development efforts in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, there can be no assurance that this level of investment in research and development will be sufficient to maintain our competitive advantage in product innovation, which could cause our business to suffer. Product improvements and new product introductions also require significant planning, design, development, and testing at the technological, product, and manufacturing process levels and we may not be able to timely develop product improvements or new products. Our competitors\u2019 new products may beat our products to market and be more attractive with more features and/or less expensive than our products.\nOur continued success is dependent on positive perceptions of our Polaris brands which, if impaired, could adversely affect our sales.\nWe believe that our Polaris brands are one of the reasons our customers choose our products. To be successful, we must preserve our reputation. Reputational value is based in large part on perceptions, and broad access to social media makes it easy for anyone to provide public feedback that can influence perceptions of our company. It may be difficult to control negative publicity, regardless of whether it is accurate. While reputations may take decades to build, any negative incidents can quickly erode trust and confidence, particularly if they result in negative mainstream and social media publicity, governmental investigations, or litigation. Negative incidents, such as quality and safety concerns or incidents related to our products, could lead to tangible adverse effects on our business, including lost sales or employee retention and recruiting difficulties. In addition, vendors and others with whom we choose to do business may affect our reputation.\nWe depend on suppliers, financing sources and other strategic partners who may be sensitive to economic conditions that could affect their businesses in a manner that adversely affects their relationship with us.\nWe source component parts and raw materials through numerous suppliers and have relationships with a limited number of product financing sources for our dealers and consumers. Our sales growth and profitability could be adversely affected if deterioration of economic or business conditions results in a weakening of the financial condition of a material number of our suppliers or financing sources, or if uncertainty about the economy or the demand for our products causes these business partners to voluntarily or involuntarily reduce or terminate their relationship with us.\nWe intend to grow our business through potential acquisitions, non-consolidating investments, alliances and new joint ventures and partnerships, which could be risky and could harm our business.\nOne of our growth strategies is to drive growth in our businesses and accelerate opportunities to expand our global presence through targeted acquisitions, non-consolidating investments, alliances, and new joint ventures and partnerships that add value while considering our existing brands and product portfolio. The benefits of an acquisition, non-consolidating investment, new joint venture or partnership may take more time than expected to develop or integrate into our operations, and we cannot guarantee that acquisitions, non-consolidating investments, alliances, joint ventures or partnerships will ultimately produce any benefits.\nThere can be no assurance that acquisitions will be consummated or that, if consummated, they will be successful. Acquisitions pose risks with respect to our ability to project and evaluate market demand, potential synergies and cost savings, make correct accounting estimates and achieve anticipated business goals and objectives. As we continue to grow, in part, through acquisitions, our success depends on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these risks. If acquired businesses do not achieve forecasted results or otherwise fail to meet projections, it could affect our results of operations.\nAcquisitions present a number of integration risks. For example, the acquisition may: disrupt operations in core, adjacent or acquired businesses; require more time than anticipated to be fully integrated into our operations and systems; create more costs than projected; divert management attention; create the potential of losing customer, supplier or other critical business relationships; and pose difficulties retaining employees. The inability to successfully integrate new businesses may result in higher production costs, lost sales or otherwise negatively affect earnings and financial results.\nOur business, properties and products are subject to extensive United States federal and state and international safety, environmental and other government regulation and any failure to comply with these regulations could harm our reputation, expose us to damages and otherwise adversely affect our business. In addition, changes to regulations may require us to incur expenses or modify product offerings in order to maintain compliance with the actions of regulators and could decrease the demand for our products.\nOur business, properties, and products are subject to numerous international, federal, state, and other governmental laws, rules, and regulations relating to, among other things: climate change; emissions to air; discharges to water; restrictions placed on water usage and water availability; product and associated packaging; use of certain chemicals; import and export compliance, including country of origin certification requirements; worker and product user health and safety; energy efficiency; product life-cycles; outdoor noise laws; and the generation, use, handling, labeling, collection, management, storage, transportation, treatment, and disposal of hazardous substances, wastes, and other regulated materials. Although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with currently applicable laws, rules, and regulations, we are unable to predict the ultimate impact of adopted or future laws, rules, and regulations on our business, properties, or products. Any of these laws, rules, or regulations may cause us to incur significant expenses to achieve or maintain compliance, require us to modify our products, adversely affect the price of or demand for some of our products, and ultimately affect the way we conduct our operations. Failure to comply with any of these laws, rules, or regulations could result in harm to our reputation and/or could lead to fines and other penalties, including restrictions on the importation of our products into, and the sale of our products in, one or more jurisdictions until compliance is achieved.\nFailure to establish and maintain the appropriate level of dealers and distributor relationships or weak economic conditions impacting those relationships may negatively impact our business and operating results.\nWe distribute our products through numerous dealers and distributors and rely on them to retail our products to the end customers. Our sales growth and profitability could be adversely affected if deterioration of economic or business conditions results in a weakening of the financial condition of a material number of our dealers and distributors. Additionally, weak demand for, or quality issues with, our products may cause dealers and distributors to voluntarily or involuntarily reduce or terminate their relationship with us. Further, if we fail to establish and maintain an appropriate level of dealers and distributors for each of our products, we may not obtain adequate market coverage for the desired level of retail sales of our products.\nRetail credit market deterioration and volatility may restrict the ability of our retail customers to finance the purchase of our products and adversely affect our income from financial services.\nWe have arrangements with each of Performance Finance, Sheffield Financial and Synchrony Bank to make retail financing available to consumers who purchase our products in the United States. During 2018, consumers financed\napproximately 35 percent of the vehicles we sold in the United States through these installment retail credit programs. Furthermore, some customers use financing from lenders who do not partner with us, such as local banks and credit unions. There can be no assurance that retail financing will continue to be available in the same amounts and under the same terms that had been previously available to our customers. If retail financing is not available to customers on satisfactory terms, it is possible that our sales and profitability could be adversely affected. Our income from financial services is also affected by changes in interest rates.\n( Our reliance upon patents, trademark laws, and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient to protect our intellectual property from others who may sell similar products and may lead to costly litigation.\nWe hold patents and trademarks relating to various aspects of our products, such as our patented \u201con demand\u201d all-wheel drive, and believe that proprietary technical know-how is important to our business. Proprietary rights relating to our products are protected from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that they are covered by valid and enforceable patents or trademarks or are maintained in confidence as trade secrets. We cannot be certain that we will be issued any patents from any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us or that the claims allowed under any issued patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. In the absence of enforceable patent or trademark protection, we may be vulnerable to competitors who attempt to copy our products, gain access to our trade secrets and know-how or diminish our brand through unauthorized use of our trademarks, all of which could adversely affect our business. Others may initiate litigation to challenge the validity of our patents, or allege that we infringe their patents, or they may use their resources to design comparable products that do not infringe our patents. We may incur substantial costs if our competitors initiate litigation to challenge the validity of our patents, or allege that we infringe their patents, or if we initiate proceedings to protect our proprietary rights. If the outcome of any such litigation is unfavorable to us, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected. Regardless of whether litigation relating to our intellectual property rights is successful, the litigation could significantly increase our costs and divert management\u2019s attention from operation of our business, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We also cannot be certain that our products or technologies have not infringed or will not infringe the proprietary rights of others. Any such infringement could cause third parties, including our competitors, to bring claims against us, resulting in significant costs, possible damages and substantial uncertainty.\nOur international operations require significant management attention and financial resources, expose us to difficulties presented by international economic, political, legal, accounting, and business factors, and may not be successful or produce desired levels of sales and profitability.\nApproximately 13 percent of our total sales during 2018 were generated outside of North America, and we intend to continue to expand our international operations as one part of our long-term strategic objectives. To support that strategy, we must increase our presence outside of North America, including adding employees and continuing to invest in business infrastructure and operations. These investments might not produce the returns we expect, which could adversely affect our profitability. International operations and sales also are inherently subject to various risks. These risks include:\n\u2022\npolitical and economic instability;\n\u2022\nincreased costs of customizing products for foreign countries;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of additional U.S. and foreign governmental controls or regulations, including the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal from or revision to international trade agreements;\n\u2022\nthe imposition or increases in import and export licensing and other compliance requirements, customs duties and tariffs, import and export quotas and other trade restrictions, license obligations, and other non-tariff barriers to trade;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of U.S. and/or international sanctions against a country, company, person, or entity with whom we do business that would restrict or prohibit our business with the sanctioned country, company, person, or entity;\n\u2022\ninternational pricing pressures;\n\u2022\nlaws and business practices favoring local companies;\n\u2022\nadverse currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u2022\nlonger payment cycles and difficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems;\n\u2022\nhigher tax rates and potentially adverse tax consequences\n\u2022\nfluctuations in our operating performance based on our geographic mix of sales;\n\u2022\ntransportation delays and interruptions;\n\u2022\nnational and international conflicts, including foreign policy changes or terrorist acts;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in protecting, enforcing or defending intellectual property rights; and\n\u2022\nmultiple, changing, and often inconsistent enforcement of laws, rules, and regulations, including rules relating to environmental, health, and safety matters.\nThe realization of any of these risks or unfavorable changes in the political, regulatory and business climate in any of the jurisdictions where we operate could have a material adverse effect on our total sales, financial condition, profitability, or cash flows.\nChanging weather conditions may reduce demand and negatively impact net sales and production of certain of our products.\nLack of snowfall in any year in any particular geographic region may adversely affect snowmobile retail sales and related PG&A sales in that region. Additionally, to the extent that unfavorable weather conditions are exacerbated by global climate change or other factors, our sales may be affected to a greater degree than we have previously experienced. There is no assurance that weather conditions or natural disasters could not have a material effect on our sales, production capability or component supply continuity for any of our products.\nAn impairment in the carrying value of goodwill and trade names could negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and net worth.\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as our trade names, are recorded at fair value at the time of acquisition and are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. Our determination of whether goodwill impairment has occurred is based on a comparison of each of our reporting units\u2019 fair market value with its carrying value. Significant and unanticipated changes in circumstances, such as significant and long-term adverse changes in business climate, unanticipated competition, and/or changes in technology or markets, could require a provision for impairment in a future period that could negatively impact our reported earnings and reduce our consolidated net worth and shareholders\u2019 equity.\nWe have a significant amount of debt outstanding and must comply with restrictive covenants in our debt agreements.\nOur credit agreement and other debt agreements contain financial and restrictive covenants that may limit our ability to, among other things, borrow additional funds or take advantage of business opportunities. While we are currently in compliance with the financial covenants, increases in our debt or decreases in our earnings could cause us to fail to comply with these financial covenants. Failing to comply with such covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all our indebtedness or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operation and debt service capability.\nOur level of debt and the financial and restrictive covenants contained in our credit agreement could have important consequences on our financial position and results of operations, including increasing our vulnerability to increases in interest rates because debt under our credit agreement bears interest at variable rates.\nAdditional tax expense or tax exposure could impact our financial performance.\nWe are subject to income taxes and other business taxes in various jurisdictions in which we operate. Our tax liabilities are dependent upon the earnings generated in these different jurisdictions. Our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability could be adversely affected by numerous factors, including income before taxes being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions with higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws and regulations in various jurisdictions. We are also subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by various tax authorities. The results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures may have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s provision for income taxes and cash tax liability.\nOur operations are dependent upon attracting and retaining skilled employees, including skilled labor. Our future success depends on our continuing ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate, retain and promote skilled personnel for all areas of our organization.\nOur success depends on attracting and retaining qualified personnel. Our ability to sustain and grow our business requires us to hire, retain and develop a highly skilled and diverse management team and workforce. Failure to ensure that we have the leadership capacity with the necessary skill set and experience could impede our ability to deliver our\ngrowth objectives and execute our strategic plan. In addition, any unplanned turnover or inability to attract and retain key employees, including managers, could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and/or results of operations.\nWe may be subject to information technology system failures, network disruptions and breaches in data security that could adversely affect our business.\nWe use many information technology systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to operate our business. Those systems process sensitive information, including proprietary business information, customer data and personal information. Acquisitions in recent years have expanded the scope and complexity of our information technology systems, and increased the amount of sensitive information that they process. Our systems have been, and could be in the future vulnerable to breach, damage, disruption, or breakdown, as a result of malicious intrusion, random attack, or misconduct or error by individuals with permitted access to our systems. Such disruptions or breaches of our information technology systems could adversely affect our business by resulting in, among other things, disruption to our business operations, compromise or loss of the information processed by those systems, damage to our reputation, and litigation or regulatory proceedings. While we invest in layers of data and information technology protection, and continually monitor cybersecurity threats, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent disruptions or breaches of our systems. To our knowledge, we have not experienced any material disruptions or breaches of our information technology systems, but we could experience material disruptions or breaches in the future.", "PERMNO": 75182, "SIC": 3790, "TIC": "PII"}
