{"cik": "811641", "company": "IMMUCELL CORP /DE/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-25", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nSafe Harbor Statement\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such statements include, but are not limited to, any statements relating to: projections of future financial performance; the scope and timing of future product development work and commercialization of our products; future costs of product development efforts; the estimated prevalence rate of subclinical mastitis; future market share of and revenue generated by products still in development; future sources of financial support for our product development, manufacturing and marketing efforts; the future adequacy of our own manufacturing facilities or those of third parties with which we have contractual relationships to meet demand for our products on a timely basis; the amount and timing of future investments in facility modifications and production equipment; the future adequacy of our working capital and the availability of third party financing; timing and future costs of a facility to produce the Drug Substance (active pharmaceutical ingredient) for Mast Out\u00ae; the timing and outcome of pending or anticipated applications for future regulatory approvals; future regulatory requirements relating to our products; future expense ratios and margins; future compliance with bank debt covenants; future realization of deferred tax assets; costs associated with sustaining compliance with cGMP regulations in our current operations and attaining such compliance for the facility to produce the Drug Substance for Mast Out\u00ae; factors that may affect the dairy and beef industries and future demand for our products; the cost-effectiveness of additional sales and marketing expenditures and resources; the accuracy of our understanding of our distributors\u2019 ordering patterns; anticipated changes in our manufacturing capabilities and efficiencies; anticipated competitive and market conditions; and any other statements that are not historical facts. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as \u201cexpects\u201d, \u201cmay\u201d, \u201canticipates\u201d, \u201caims\u201d, \u201cintends\u201d, \u201cwould\u201d, \u201ccould\u201d, \u201cshould\u201d, \u201cwill\u201d, \u201cplans\u201d, \u201cbelieves\u201d, \u201cestimates\u201d, \u201ctargets\u201d, \u201cprojects\u201d, \u201cforecasts\u201d and similar words and expressions. In addition, there can be no assurance that future developments affecting us will be those that we anticipate. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those risks and uncertainties relating to difficulties or delays in development, testing, regulatory approval, production and marketing of our products, competition within our anticipated product markets, alignment between our manufacturing resources and product demand, the uncertainties associated with product development and Drug Substance manufacturing, our potential reliance upon third parties for financial support, products and services, changes in laws and regulations, decision making by regulatory authorities, possible dilutive impacts on existing stockholders from any equity financing transactions in which we may engage, currency fluctuations and other risks detailed from time to time in filings we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, our Annual Reports on Form 10-K and our Current Reports on Form 8-K. Such statements are based on our current expectations, but actual results may differ materially due to various factors, including the risk factors summarized below and uncertainties otherwise referred to in this Annual Report.\nProjection of net income: Generally speaking, our financial performance can differ significantly from management projections, due to numerous factors that are difficult to predict or that are beyond our control. Weaker than expected sales of First Defense\u00ae or continued or extended shortfalls in production relative to the growing product sales demand could lead to less profits or an operating loss. Large investments in product development (or cost overruns) can result in a net loss. Given our strategic decision to invest approximately $973,000 during 2014 in facilities for the manufacture of the Drug Substance at small-scale, we recorded a net (loss) of ($167,000) during the year ended December 31, 2014 as expected, despite a return to profitability during the last six months of 2014. We continued to be profitable during 2015. Subject to the temporary production constraints described above, we expect the sales growth trend for First Defense\u00ae and the recent profitability trend to continue.\nReliance on sales of First Defense\u00ae: We are heavily reliant on the market acceptance of First Defense\u00ae to generate product sales and fund our operations (including part of our planned expansion to commercialize Mast Out\u00ae). Our business would not have been profitable during the nine consecutive years in the period ended December 31, 2007, or during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2015, without the gross margin that we earned on sales of First Defense\u00ae, which accounted for almost 93% of our product sales during 2015.\nProduct risks generally: The sale of our products is subject to financial, efficacy, regulatory, competitive and other market risks. We cannot be sure that we will be able to maintain the regulatory compliance required to continue selling our products. There is no assurance that we will continue to achieve market acceptance at a profitable price level or that we can continue to manufacture our products at a low enough cost to result in a sufficient gross margin to justify their continued manufacture and sale.\nProduct liability: The manufacture and sale of our products entails a risk of product liability. Our exposure to product liability is mitigated to some extent by the fact that our products are principally directed towards the animal health market. We have maintained product liability insurance in an amount which we believe is reasonable in relation to our potential exposure in this area. We have no history of claims of this nature being made.\nImmuCell Corporation\nProtection of intellectual property: Reliance upon trade secret, rather than patent, protection may cause us to be vulnerable to competitors who successfully replicate our manufacturing techniques and processes. Additionally, there can be no assurance that others may not independently develop similar trade secrets or technology or obtain access to our unpatented trade secrets or proprietary technology. Other companies may have filed patent applications and may have been issued patents involving products or technologies potentially useful to us or necessary for us to commercialize our products or achieve our business goals. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain licenses to such patents on terms that are acceptable.\nRegulatory requirements for First Defense\u00ae: First Defense\u00ae is sold in the United States subject to a product license from the Center for Veterinary Biologics, USDA, which was first obtained in 1991. The potency of serial lots is directly traceable to the original serial used to obtain the product performance claims (the \u201cReference Standard\u201d). Due to the unique nature of the First Defense\u00d2 label claims, host animal re-testing is not required as long as periodic laboratory analyses continue to support the stability of stored Reference Standard. To date, these analyses have demonstrated strong stability. However, if the USDA were not to approve requalification of the Reference Standard, additional clinical studies could be required to meet regulatory requirements and allow for continued sales of the product. Similar regulatory oversight risks exist in territories outside of the United States where we sell our products.\nRegulatory requirements for Wipe Out\u00d2 Dairy Wipes: While the FDA regulates the manufacture and sale of Wipe Out\u00d2 Dairy Wipes, this type of product is permitted to be sold without a NADA approval, in accordance with the FDA\u2019s Compliance Policy Guide 7125.30 (\u201cTeat Dips and Udder Washes for Dairy Cows and Goats\u201d). This policy guide could be withdrawn at the FDA\u2019s discretion, in which case we would likely discontinue sales of the product. The manufacture of Wipe Out\u00d2 Dairy Wipes is subject to Part 211 of the cGMP regulations. As a result, our operations are subject to inspection by the FDA. During the second quarter of 2007, the FDA inspected our facilities and operations and issued a Warning Letter to us, citing deficiencies in specific areas of the cGMP regulations. We filed an initial response to the FDA during the second quarter of 2007, and we responded to a request for additional information during the second quarter of 2008. During the first quarter of 2013, the FDA again inspected our facilities and operations. The report from this inspection was very favorable, and we responded to the few, minor observations that were noted. We remain subject to the risk of adverse action by the FDA in this respect.\nRegulatory requirements for Mast Out\u00d2: The commercial introduction of Mast Out\u00d2 in the United States will require us to obtain appropriate FDA approval for this product. Completing the development of Mast Out\u00d2 through to the submission of the administrative NADA to the FDA involves a great deal of risk. It presently is uncertain when or if this approval will be achieved, but we have disclosed a timeline of events that could lead to our achieving FDA approval during late 2018 or 2019. We are exposed to additional regulatory compliance risks through the subcontractors that we choose to work with to produce Mast Out\u00d2, who also need to satisfy certain regulatory requirements in order to provide us with the products and services we need. International regulatory approvals would be required for sales outside of the United States. European regulatory authorities are not expected to approve a product with a zero milk discard claim, which would remove a significant competitive advantage of Mast Out\u00d2 in that territory. However, the assigned milk discard period may be shorter for Mast Out\u00d2 than it is for other products on the market in Europe.\nConcentration of sales: Approximately 83% of our product sales were made to customers in the U.S. dairy and beef industries during both of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. Approximately 97% and 96% of our product sales were made to customers in the dairy and beef industries throughout the world during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. A large portion of our product sales (62%, 61%, and 60% for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively) was made to two large distributors. A large portion of our trade accounts receivable (52% and 71% as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively) was due from these two distributors. We have a good history with these distributors, but the concentration of sales and accounts receivable with a small number of customers does present a risk to us, including risks related to such customers experiencing financial difficulties or altering the basis on which they do business with us.\nEconomics of the dairy and beef industries:\n\u25cf All cattle and calves in the United States as of January 1, 2016 totaled 92,000,000, which is 3.3% higher than January 1, 2015. Prior to January 1, 2015, the January count of cattle inventory had steadily declined from 97,000,000 as of January 1, 2007.\n\u25cf All cattle and calves in the United States as of July 1, 2015 totaled 98,400,000, which is 2.2% higher than July 1, 2014. This is the first increase in the July count of cattle inventory since 2006, suggesting the rebuilding of the U.S. herd has begun. The July 1, 2014 amount of 96,300,000 was the lowest inventory count as of July 1st in decades.\n\u25cf From 1998 through 2015, the size (annual average) of the U.S. dairy herd ranged from approximately the low of 9,011,000 (2004) to the high of 9,315,000 (2015). The 2015 level exceeded the previous high during this eighteen-year period of 9,314,000 in 2008.\nImmuCell Corporation\n\u25cf While the number of cows in the U.S. herd and the production of milk per cow directly influence the supply of milk, demand for milk is also influenced by very volatile international demand for milk products. The Class III milk price (an industry benchmark that reflects the value of product used to make cheese) is an important indicator because it defines our customers\u2019 revenue level. This annual average milk price level (measured in dollars per hundred pounds of milk) for 2014 of $22.34 (peaking at $24.60 in September 2014) was the highest level since these records were first reported in 1980. This strong price level declined to the average of $15.80 during 2015. This price decreased further to $13.72 in January 2016. The recent annual fluctuations in this milk price level are demonstrated in the following table:\n\u25cf The actual level of milk prices may be less important than its level relative to feed costs. One measure of this relationship is known as the milk-to-feed price ratio, which represents the amount of feed that one pound of milk can buy. The annual average for this ratio of 1.52 in 2012 was the lowest recorded since this ratio was first reported in 1985. The highest annual average this ratio has reached since 1985 was 3.64 in 1987. Since this ratio reached 3.24 in 2005, it has not exceeded 3.0. The annual average of 2.54 for 2014 was the highest this ratio has been since it was 2.81 in 2007. This ratio dropped to an annual average of 2.12 during 2015. The following table demonstrates the annual volatility and the low values of this ratio recently:\n\u25cf An increase in feed costs also has a negative impact on the beef industry. Widespread severe drought conditions in key U.S. agricultural regions during 2012 drove feed costs higher and the inventory of all cattle and calves lower. The positive trend in these market indices during 2013 and 2014 resulted in an increase in the value of milk cows. The 2014 annual average price for a milk cow increased by 32% to $1,835 in comparison to 2013. Previously, this annual average price since 1970 was only higher when it reached $1,840 in 2007 and $1,953 in 2008. This annual average price for 2015 increased by 9% to $1,993 in comparison to 2014. The industry data referred to above is compiled from USDA databases. Recently, the value of newborn bull calves has risen to the unusually high level of approximately $300 to $400. At this price, producers are more likely to invest in First Defense\u00ae for their bull calves. Given our focus on the dairy and beef industries, the volatile market conditions and the resulting financial insecurities of our primary end users are risks to our ability to maintain and grow sales at a profitable level. These factors also heighten the challenge of selling premium-priced animal health products (such as Mast Out\u00d2) into the dairy market.\nProduct development risks: The development of new products is subject to financial, scientific, regulatory and market risks. Our current business growth strategy relies heavily on the development of Mast Out\u00d2, which requires (and will continue to require) a substantial investment. Our efforts will be subject to inspection and approval by the FDA. There is no assurance whether or when we will obtain all of the data necessary to support regulatory approval for this product.\nImmuCell Corporation\nRisks associated with Mast Out\u00d2 funding strategy: The construction of and the financing for the commercial-scale Drug Substance production facility is the most critical action in front of us on our path to U.S. regulatory approval for Mast Out\u00d2. During the first quarter of 2016, we sold 1.1 million shares of common stock in an underwritten public offering registered with the SEC, raising $5.3 million in net proceeds. Also during the first quarter of 2016, we signed a commitment letter covering a $4.5 million bank debt facility. Together with our cash and investments, plus cash to be generated from operations, we believe that we will have adequate financing to complete the project. However, due to the risks described herein, we could fail to generate sufficient cash to fully fund that project, and we could experience cost overruns or delays.\nUncertainty of market size and product sales estimates: Even assuming that Mast Out\u00d2 achieves regulatory approval in the United States with a zero milk discard requirement, estimating the size of the market for this product is subject to numerous uncertainties. Some of the uncertainties surrounding our product include market acceptance, the development of the subclinical mastitis treatment market, the effect of a premium selling price on market penetration, cost of manufacture and integration of milk from treated cows with susceptible cheese starter cultures.\nCompetition from others: Many of our competitors are significantly larger and more diversified in the relevant markets than we are and have substantially greater financial, marketing, manufacturing and human resources and more extensive product development capabilities than we do, including greater ability to withstand adverse economic or market conditions and declining revenues and/or profitability. Zoetis, Elanco and Boehringer Ingelheim, among other companies, sell products that compete directly with First Defense\u00d2 in preventing scours in newborn calves. The product sold by Elanco experienced a lack of supply in the market during late 2014 and into the middle of 2015, which appears to have been resolved. The product sold by Zoetis does carry a rotavirus claim, which we do not yet have, but it does not have an E. coli claim, and it sells for approximately half the price of our product. The market for the treatment of mastitis in dairy cows is highly competitive, and presently is dominated by large companies such as Zoetis, Merck and Boehringer Ingelheim. There is no assurance that Mast Out\u00d2 will compete successfully in this market. We may not be aware of other companies that compete with us or intend to compete with us in the future.\nAccess to raw materials: Our policy is to maintain more than one source of supply for the components used to manufacture and test our products that we obtain from third parties. However, there is a risk that we could have difficulty in efficiently acquiring essential supplies. The loss of farms from which we buy raw material for First Defense\u00ae could make it difficult for us to produce enough inventory until supply agreements are reached with replacement farms on suitable terms. We are dependent on our manufacturing facility and operations at 56 Evergreen Drive in Portland for the production of First Defense\u00d2 and our topical wipes and will be dependent on the facility we are preparing to construct for the production of Mast Out\u00d2 when that product begins commercial sales. The specific antibodies that we purify from colostrum for First Defense\u00d2 and the Nisin we produce by fermentation for our topical wipes are not readily available from other sources. We expect to be dependent on Plas-Pak for the supply of the syringes used for Mast Out\u00d2. We expect to be dependent on Norbrook for the sterile-filling and final packaging of our Drug Substance into Drug Product. Given the requirement that such a facility be inspected and approved by the FDA, it could be costly and time-consuming to find an adequate alternative source for these services. Any significant damage to or other disruption in the services at these facilities (including due to regulatory non-compliance) could adversely affect the production of inventory and result in significant added expenses and loss of future sales.\nRisk of sales order backlog: Given our recent and significant increase in sales demand for First Defense\u00d2, our manufacturing resources (internal and third party) were no longer sufficient to avoid a backlog of orders. In response, we completed an investment to increase our liquid processing capacity by 50% during the fourth quarter of 2015 and our freeze drying capacity by 100% during the first quarter of 2016. Until we produce enough inventory to clear this backlog of orders, we are at risk of losing customers that are unable to acquire our product on a timely basis.\nSmall size; dependence on key personnel: We are a small company with 46 employees (including 5 part-time employees). As such, we rely on certain key employees to support different operational functions, with limited redundancy in capacity. The loss of any of these key employees could adversely affect our operations until a qualified replacement is hired and trained. Our competitive position will be highly influenced by our ability to attract and retain key scientific, managerial and sales and marketing personnel, to develop proprietary technologies and products, to obtain USDA or FDA approval for new products and to continue to profitably sell our current products. We currently compete on the basis of product performance, price and distribution capability. We continue to monitor our network of independent distributors to maintain our competitive position.\nImmuCell Corporation\nFailure to protect intellectual property: In some cases, we have chosen (and may choose in the future) not to seek patent protection for certain products or processes. Instead, we have sought (and may seek in the future) to maintain the confidentiality of any relevant proprietary technology through operational safeguards and contractual agreements. Reliance upon trade secret, rather than patent, protection may cause us to be vulnerable to competitors who successfully replicate our manufacturing techniques and processes. Additionally, there can be no assurance that others may not independently develop similar trade secrets or technology or obtain access to our unpatented trade secrets or proprietary technology. Other companies may have filed patent applications and may have been issued patents involving products or technologies potentially useful to us or necessary for us to commercialize our products or achieve our business goals. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain licenses to such patents on terms that are acceptable. There is also a risk that competitors could challenge the claims in patents that have been issued to us.\nCertain provisions might discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our Company or changes in our management: Provisions of our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws, our Common Stock Rights Plan or Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares of our common stock. These provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management. These provisions include:\n\u25cf limitations on the removal of directors; advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations;\n\u25cf the ability of our Board of Directors to alter or repeal our bylaws;\n\u25cf the ability of our Board of Directors to refuse to redeem rights issued under our Common Stock Rights Plan or otherwise to limit or suspend its operation that would work to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, likely preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our Board of Directors; and\n\u25cf Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits a publicly-held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder (generally defined as a person which together with its affiliates owns, or within the last three years has owned, 15% of our voting stock, for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder) unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nThe existence of the foregoing provisions and anti-takeover measures could depress the trading price of our common stock or limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. They could also deter potential acquirers of our Company, thereby reducing the likelihood of obtaining a premium for our common stock in an acquisition.\nCost burdens of our reporting obligations as a public company: Operating a public company involves substantial costs to comply with reporting obligations under federal securities laws and the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\nExposure to risks associated with the financial downturn and global economic crisis: The U.S. economy has technically come out of a recession, which was caused principally by the housing, credit and financial crises of the late 2000\u2019s. However, such recent positive indications could prove temporary and further downturn could occur, and the European economy remains sluggish and precarious. Certain emerging markets also show signs of slower growth or, in some areas, downturns in economic performance. The credit markets continue to be very turbulent and uncertain. This extraordinary period of instability in the U.S. economy and the financial markets has been troubling for nearly all Americans. Some observers believe that the housing market remains problematic for the overall U.S. economy, the United States has taken on too much national debt and the equity markets are overvalued (especially prior to the market correction of early 2016). A combination of the conditions, trends and concerns summarized above could have a corresponding negative effect on our business and operations, including the demand for our products in the U.S. market and our ability to penetrate international markets.\nBovine diseases: The potential for epidemics of bovine diseases such as Foot and Mouth Disease, Bovine Tuberculosis, Brucellosis and Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) presents a risk to us and our customers. Documented cases of BSE in the United States have led to an overall tightening of regulations pertaining to ingredients of animal origin, especially bovine. First Defense\u00d2 is considered a veterinary medicine rather than a feed ingredient, and it is manufactured from bovine milk (colostrum), which is not considered a BSE risk material. Future regulatory action to increase protection of the human food supply could affect First Defense\u00d2, although presently we do not anticipate that this will be the case.\nImmuCell Corporation\nBiological terrorism: The threat of biological terrorism is a risk to both the economic health of our customers and our ability to economically acquire and collect good quality raw material from our contract farms. Any act of widespread bioterrorism against the dairy industry could adversely affect our operations.\nStock market valuation: Our common stock trades on The Nasdaq Stock Market (NASDAQ: ICCC). Our average daily trading volume (although it has increased recently) is lower than the volume for most other companies and the bid/ask stock price spread can be larger, which could result in investors facing difficulty selling their stock for proceeds that they may expect or desire. There are companies in the animal health sector with market capitalization values that greatly exceed our current market capitalization of approximately $25,000,000. Some of these companies have little or no product sales. We currently have annual product sales of over $10,000,000. The stock price of some of these companies has been volatile. Before gross margin from the sale of new products is achieved, our market capitalization may be heavily dependent on the perceived potential for growth from our products under development.\nNo expectation to pay any dividends or repurchase stock for the foreseeable future: We do not anticipate paying any dividends to, or repurchasing stock from, our stockholders for the foreseeable future. Instead, we expect to use cash to fund product development costs and investments in our facility and production equipment and to reduce debt. Any debt or equity financing we obtain to assist in funding our product development programs or expanding our facilities may include terms prohibiting or restricting our paying dividends or repurchasing stock for a lengthy period. Stockholders must be prepared to rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation to earn an investment return, which may never occur. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable laws, current and anticipated needs for liquidity and other factors our Board of Directors deems relevant.", "PERMNO": 11292, "SIC": 2835, "TIC": "ICCC"}
