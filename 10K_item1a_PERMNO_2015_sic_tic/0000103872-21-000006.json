RISK FACTORS\nRisk Factors\nWe maintain a risk management program which incorporates assessments by our officers, senior management and board of directors, as periodically updated. The following risks have been identified. You should carefully consider these risks along with the other information contained in this report. The following risks could materially and adversely affect our business and, as a result, our financial condition, results of operations and the market price of our common stock. Other risks and uncertainties not known to us or that we currently do not recognize as material could also materially adversely affect our business and, as a result, our financial condition, results of operations and the market price of our common stock.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Industry and Business Environment\nOur business, results of operations and financial condition has been and may continue to be adversely impacted by global public health epidemics, including the strain of coronavirus known as COVID-19, and future adverse impacts could be material and difficult to predict\nThe global spread of the coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d), which was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020, has created significant volatility, uncertainty and global macroeconomic disruption due to related government actions (including declared states of emergency and quarantine, \u201cshelter in place\u201d or similar orders), non-governmental agency recommendations and public perceptions and disruption in global economic and labor market conditions. These effects have had, and continue to have, an adverse impact on our business, including reduced demand for our services, worker absences, client shutdowns and reduced operations, a reduction in bill rates and a shift of a majority of our in-house workforce to remote operations. Other impacts of the spread of COVID-19 include continued or expanded closures of our clients\u2019 facilities, the increased possibility our clients will not be able to pay for our services and solutions, or that they will attempt to defer payments owed to us, any of which could materially impact our liquidity. Further, we may continue to experience adverse financial impacts if we cannot offset revenue declines with cost savings through expense-related initiatives, human capital management initiatives or otherwise. Additionally, adverse changes in economic or operating conditions impacting our estimates and assumptions can result in the impairment of our goodwill or long-lived assets, including our lease right of use assets. A decline in the fair market rent of real estate properties has impacted the amount of impairment charges we are required to record on certain of our lease assets as a result of these adverse economic conditions. In addition, this global pandemic has also resulted in a significant number of new regulations and rules, the cost of compliance and monitoring of which may have a continued impact on our business and existing resources.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Capital Structure and Finances\nOur credit facility contains financial covenants that may limit our ability to take certain actions\nWe remain dependent upon our financing agreement which includes certain financial covenants. These covenants could constrain the execution of our business strategy and growth plans. Our ability to continue to meet these financial covenants is not assured. If we default under any of these requirements, our lenders could restrict our ability to access funds in our customer collections account, declare all outstanding borrowings, accrued interest and fees due and payable, or significantly increase the cost of the facility. Under such circumstances, there could be no assurance that we would have sufficient liquidity to repay or refinance the indebtedness at favorable rates or at all. If we are forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by increased costs and rates. As of November 1, 2020, we were in compliance with all covenant requirements, as amended.\nTurmoil in the financial markets could limit our ability to fully utilize available credit, which could negatively affect our operations and limit our liquidity\nWe rely on financing for future working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes. Turmoil in financial markets may create additional risks to our business in the future which may limit our ability to fully utilize available credit provided by our financing program. Volatility in the credit markets or a contraction in the availability of credit or higher borrowing costs due to increasing interest rates may make it more difficult for us to meet our working capital requirements and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.\nOur ability to retain acceptable insurance coverage limits at commercially reasonable cost and terms may adversely impact our financial results\nWe cannot be certain we will be able to obtain appropriate types or levels of insurance in the future, that adequate replacement policies will be available on acceptable terms, if at all, and at commercially reasonable cost, or that the companies from which we have obtained insurance will be able to pay claims we make under such policies. Our coverage under certain insurance policies is limited and the losses that we may face may not be covered, may be subject to high deductibles or may exceed the limits purchased.\nSome customers require extensive insurance coverage and request insurance endorsements that are not available under standard monoline policies. There can be no assurance that we will be able to negotiate acceptable compromises with customers or negotiate appropriate changes in our insurance contracts. This may adversely affect our ability to take on new customers or accepted changes in insurance terms with existing customers.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Operations\nThe loss of major customers could adversely impact our business\nWe experience revenue concentration with large customers within certain operating segments, as well as concentrations of interrelated customers. Although we have no customer that represents over 10% of our consolidated revenues, there are customers that exceed 10% of revenues within both the International Staffing and North American MSP segments. The deterioration of the financial condition or significant change to the business or staffing model of these customers or multiple customers in a similar industry, or similar customers that are interdependent could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur results of operations and ability to grow may be negatively affected if we are not able to keep pace with rapid changes in technology\nThe Company\u2019s success depends on our ability to keep pace with rapid technological changes in the development, implementation and operation of our services and solutions. We must innovate and evolve our services and products to satisfy customer requirements, attract talent and remain competitive. There can be no assurance that we will be able to foresee changes needed to identify, develop and commercialize innovative and competitive services and products in a timely and cost-effective manner to achieve customer acceptance in markets characterized by rapidly changing technology and frequent new product and service introductions.\nUnexpected changes in workers\u2019 compensation and other insurance plans may negatively impact our financial condition\nWe purchase workers\u2019 compensation insurance through mandated participation in certain state funds and the experience-rated premiums in these state plans relieve the Company of any additional liability. Liability for workers\u2019 compensation in all other states as well as automobile and general liability is insured under a paid loss deductible casualty insurance program for losses exceeding specified deductible levels. We are financially responsible for losses below the specified deductible limits.\nThe Company is self-insured for a portion of its medical benefit programs. The liability for the self-insured medical benefits is limited on a per-claimant basis through the purchase of stop-loss insurance. The Company\u2019s retained liability for the self-insured medical benefits is determined by utilizing actuarial estimates of expected claims based on statistical analysis of historical data.\nUnexpected changes related to our workers\u2019 compensation, medical and disability benefit plans may negatively impact our financial condition. Changes in the severity and frequency of claims, state laws regarding benefit levels and allowable claims, actuarial estimates, or medical cost inflation could result in costs that are significantly higher. If future claims-related liabilities increase beyond our expectations, or if we must make unfavorable adjustments to accruals for prior accident years, our costs could increase significantly. There can be no assurance that we will be able to increase the fees charged to our customers in a timely manner and in a sufficient amount to cover the increased costs that result from any changes in claims-related liabilities.\nMany of our contracts provide no minimum purchase requirements, are cancellable during the term, or both\nIn our staffing services business, most of our contracts, even those with multi-year terms, provide no assurance of any minimum amount of revenue and under many of these contracts we still must compete for each individual placement or project. In addition, many of our contracts contain cancellation provisions under which the customer can cancel the contract at any time or on relatively short notice, even if we are not in default under the contract. Therefore, these contracts do not provide the\nassurances that typical long-term contracts often provide and are inherently uncertain with respect to the amount of revenues and earnings we may realize.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Information Technology, Cybersecurity and Data Protection\nWe could incur liabilities, or our reputation could be damaged, from a cyber-attack or improper disclosure or loss of sensitive or confidential company, employee, associate, candidate or client data, including personal data\nOur business involves the use, storage and transfer of certain information about our full-time and contingent employees, customers and other individuals. We rely upon multiple information technology systems and networks, some of which are web-based or managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities. This information contains sensitive or confidential employee and customer data, including personally identifiable information. The secure and consistent operation of these systems, networks and processes is critical to our business operations. Our systems and networks have been, and will continue to be, the target of cyber-attacks, computer viruses, worms, phishing attacks, malicious software programs and other cyber-security incidents that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, use, loss or destruction of our customers\u2019 or employees\u2019 sensitive and personal data. Successful cyber-attacks or other data breaches, as well as risks associated with compliance with applicable data privacy laws, could harm our reputation, divert management attention and resources, increase our operating expenses due to the employment of consultants and third-party experts and the purchase of additional infrastructure and/or subject us to legal liability, resulting in increased costs and loss of revenues.\nWhile we proactively safeguard our data and have enhanced security software and controls, it is possible that our security controls over sensitive or confidential data and other practices we and our third-party service providers follow may not prevent improper access to, or disclosure of, such information. Any such disclosure or security breach could subject us to significant monetary damages or losses, litigation, regulatory enforcement actions or fines. In addition, our liability insurance might not be sufficient in scope or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches, social engineering, cyber-attacks and other related data disclosure, loss or breach.\nAs cyber-attacks increase in frequency and sophistication, our cyber-security and business continuity plans may not be effective in anticipating, preventing and effectively responding to all potential cyber-risk exposures. Further, data privacy is subject to frequently changing rules and regulations, which are not uniform and may possibly conflict in jurisdictions and countries where we provide services. Our failure to adhere to or successfully implement processes in response to changing regulatory requirements in this area could result in legal liability or impairment to our reputation in the marketplace.\nAdditionally, our employees and certain of our third-party service providers may have access or exposure to sensitive customer data and systems. The misuse or unauthorized disclosure of information could result in contractual and legal liability for us due to the actions or inactions of our employees or vendors.\nWe rely extensively on our information technology systems which are vulnerable to damage and interruption\nWe rely on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet and cloud services, to process, transmit and store electronic and financial information, manage a variety of business processes and activities and comply with regulatory, legal and tax requirements. We depend on our information technology infrastructure for digital marketing activities, collection and retention of customer data, employee information and for electronic communications among our locations, personnel, customers and suppliers around the world. While we take various precautions and have enhanced controls around our systems, our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components thereof, power outages, hardware failures, computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers, telecommunication failures, user errors or catastrophic events. Our sales, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected and we could experience delays in reporting our financial results, if our information technology systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur stock price has experienced volatility and, as a result, investors may not be able to resell their shares at or above the price they paid for them\nOur stock price may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022our failure to meet the expectations of the investment community or our estimates of our future results of operations;\n\u2022industry trends and the business success of our customers;\n\u2022loss of one or more key customers;\n\u2022strategic moves by our competitors, such as product or service announcements or acquisitions;\n\u2022regulatory developments;\n\u2022litigation;\n\u2022general economic conditions;\n\u2022other domestic and international macroeconomic factors unrelated to our performance; and\n\u2022any of the other previously noted risk factors.\nThe stock market has experienced and is likely to experience in the future, volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations, as well as our relatively low daily trading volume, may also adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nCertain shareholders, whose interests may differ from those of other shareholders, own a significant percentage of our common stock and may be able to exercise significant influence over Volt\nOwnership of a significant amount of our outstanding common stock is concentrated among certain shareholders, including related family members and certain funds. Although there can be no assurance as to how these shareholders will vote, if they were to vote in the same manner, certain combinations of such persons might be able to control or materially influence the outcome of advisory votes or matters requiring shareholder approval. The interests or motivations of such individual shareholders may not align with those of our shareholders generally.\nOur business could be negatively affected as a result of a potential proxy contest for the election of directors at our annual meeting or other shareholder activism\nA proxy contest would require us to incur significant legal fees and proxy solicitation expenses and require significant time and attention by management and the Board of Directors. The potential of a proxy contest or other shareholder activism could interfere with our ability to execute our strategic plan, give rise to perceived uncertainties as to our future direction, adversely affect our relationships with key business partners, result in the loss of potential business opportunities or make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nThe market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected by the events, risks and uncertainties related to stockholder activism.\nNew York State law, our Articles of Incorporation and By-laws contain provisions that could make corporate ownership changes at Volt more difficult\nCertain provisions of New York State law and our articles of incorporation and by-laws could have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring Volt, even if a change in control would be beneficial to our shareholders.\nThe provisions of the New York Business Corporation Law, to which we are subject, require the affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds of all of our outstanding shares entitled to vote to adopt a plan of merger or consolidation between us and another entity or to approve any sale, lease, exchange or other disposition of all or substantially all of our assets not made in the ordinary course of business. Accordingly, our substantial shareholders, if they were to act together, could prevent approval of such transactions even if such transactions are in the best interest of our other shareholders.\nIn addition, our articles of incorporation and by-laws provide:\n\u2022an advance notice requirement for shareholder proposals and director nominees;\n\u2022that removal of directors shall only be for cause; and\n\u2022that vacancies on the Board of Directors be filled for the unexpired term by a majority vote of the remaining directors then in office.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nThe contingent staffing industry is very competitive with few significant barriers to entry\nThe markets for Volt\u2019s staffing services are highly competitive with few barriers to entry. Our industry is large and fragmented, comprised of thousands of firms employing millions of people and generating billions of dollars in annual revenue. In most areas, no single company has a dominant share of the employment services market. Some of our competitors are larger than us, have substantial marketing and financial resources and may be better positioned in certain markets than we are. These companies may be better able than we are to attract and retain qualified personnel, to offer more favorable pricing and terms, or otherwise attract and retain the business that we seek. Any inability to compete effectively could adversely affect our business and financial results. Clients may also take advantage of low-cost alternatives including using their own in-house resources rather than engaging a third party. In addition, some of our staffing services customers, generally larger companies, are mandated or otherwise motivated to utilize the services of small or minority-owned companies rather than large corporations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to compete effectively in our business segments.\nWe are dependent upon the quality of our human capital\nOur operations are dependent upon our ability to attract and retain skilled personnel, for temporary assignments and projects, as well as internally, including in the areas of maintenance and protection of our systems. The availability of such skilled personnel is dependent upon a number of economic and demographic conditions. We may, in the future, find it difficult or costlier to hire such personnel in the face of competition from our competitors, which could directly impact our gross margins and overall results of operations.\nIn addition, variations in the unemployment rate and higher wages sought by contingent workers in certain technical fields that continue to experience labor shortages could affect our ability to meet our customers\u2019 demands in these fields and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are subject to employment-related claims, commercial indemnification claims and other claims and losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business\nOur staffing services business employs or engages individuals on a contingent basis and places them in a customer\u2019s workplace. Our ability to control the customer\u2019s workplace is limited and we risk incurring liability to our employees for injury (which can result in increased workers\u2019 compensation costs) or other harm that they suffer in the scope of employment at the customer\u2019s workplace or while under the customer\u2019s control.\nAdditionally, we risk liability to our customers for the actions or inactions of our employees, including those individuals employed on a contingent basis that may cause harm to our customers or other employees. Such actions may be the result of errors and omissions in the application of laws, rules, policies and procedures, discrimination, retaliation, negligence or misconduct on the part of our employees, damage to customer facilities or property due to negligence, criminal activity and other similar claims. In some cases, we must indemnify our customers for certain acts of our employees and certain customers have negotiated broad indemnification provisions. We may also incur fines, penalties and losses that are not covered by insurance or negative publicity with respect to these matters. There can be no assurance that the policies and procedures we have in place will be effective or that we will not experience losses due to such risks. In addition, we may face claims related to violations of wage and hour regulations, Fair Credit Reporting Act violations, discrimination, harassment, negligence or misconduct by our employees and claims relating to the misclassification of independent contractors, among other types of claims.\nOur operational results could be negatively impacted by currency fluctuations and other global business risks and regulations\nOur global operations subject us to risks relating to our international business activities, including global economic conditions, fluctuations in currency exchange rates and numerous legal and regulatory requirements placed upon the Company\u2019s international clients.\nVariation in the economic condition or unemployment levels in any of the foreign countries in which the Company does business may severely reduce the demand for the Company\u2019s services.\nOur business is exposed to fluctuation in exchange rates. Our operations outside the United States are reported in the applicable local currencies and then translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable currency exchange rates for inclusion in our Consolidated\nFinancial Statements. Exchange rates for currencies of these countries may fluctuate in relation to the U.S. dollar and these fluctuations may have an adverse or favorable effect on our operating results when translating foreign currencies into U.S. dollars.\nIn addition, the Company faces risks in complying with various foreign laws and technical standards and unpredictable changes in foreign regulations, including U.S. legal requirements governing U.S. companies operating in foreign countries, legal and cultural differences in the conduct of business, potential adverse tax consequences, difficulty in staffing and managing international operations.\nWe are additionally subject to numerous legal and regulatory requirements that prohibit bribery and corrupt acts. These include the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, as well as similar legislation in many of the countries and territories in which we operate. While we have training programs and appropriate internal controls in place, there can be no assurances that these will be effective to prevent and detect all potential business practices that are prohibited by our policies and these laws and regulations.\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s (\u201cU.K.\u201d) referendum to exit from the European Union (\u201cE.U.\u201d) will continue to have uncertain effects and could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition\nAs a result of a referendum in June 2016, the U.K. withdrew from the E.U. (\u201cBrexit\u201d) on January 31, 2020. It began a transition period in which to negotiate a new trading relationship for goods and services that ended on December 31, 2020. During the time since the June 2016 referendum, there have been periods of significant volatility in the global stock markets and currency exchange rates, as well as challenging market conditions in the U.K. On December 24, 2020, the U.K. and E.U. announced they had entered into a post-Brexit deal on certain aspects of trade and other strategic and political issues. We are currently in the process of evaluating our own risks and uncertainty related to ascertain what financial, trade, regulatory and legal implications this new Brexit trade deal could have on our U.K. and European business operations. This uncertainty also includes the impact on our customers\u2019 business operations and capital planning as well as the overall impact on the staffing industry. While we have not experienced any direct material financial impact since the 2016 referendum, we cannot predict its future implications, however Brexit and its related effects could result in a negative impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nNew or increased government regulation, employment costs or taxes could have a material adverse effect on our business, especially for our contingent staffing business\nCertain of our businesses are subject to licensing and regulation in some states and most foreign jurisdictions. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to comply with these requirements, or that the cost of compliance will not become material. Additionally, the jurisdictions in which we do or intend to do business may:\n\u2022create new or additional regulations that mandate additional requirements or prohibit or restrict the types of services that we currently provide;\n\u2022change regulations in ways that cause short-term disruption or impose costs to comply;\n\u2022impose new or additional employment costs that we may not be able to pass on to customers or that could cause customers to reduce their use of our services;\n\u2022require us to obtain additional licenses; or\n\u2022increase taxes (especially payroll and other employment-related taxes) or enact new or different taxes payable by the providers or users of services such as those offered by us, thereby increasing our costs, some of which we may not be able to pass on to customers or that could cause customers to reduce their use of our services especially in our staffing services, which could adversely impact our results of operations or cash flows.\nFrom time to time, the staffing industry has come under criticism from unions, works councils, regulatory agencies and other constituents that maintain that labor and employment protections, such as wage and benefits regulations, are subverted when customers use contingent staffing services. Our business is dependent on the continued acceptance of contingent staffing arrangements as a source of flexible labor for our customers. If attitudes or business practices in some locations change due to pressure from organized labor, political groups or regulatory agencies, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In some of our foreign markets, new and proposed regulatory activity, including the pending off-payroll working rules (IR35 legislation) in Europe, may impose additional requirements and costs, which could have an adverse effect on our contingent staffing business.\nFailure to maintain adequate financial and management processes and internal controls could lead to errors in our financial reporting\nThe accuracy of our financial reporting is dependent on the effectiveness of our internal controls. We are required to provide a report from management to our shareholders on our internal control over financial reporting that includes an assessment of the effectiveness of these controls. Internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations, including human error, the possibility that controls could be circumvented or become inadequate because of changed conditions, resource challenges and fraud. Because of these inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting might not prevent or detect all misstatements or fraud. If we cannot maintain and execute adequate internal control over financial reporting or implement required new or improved controls that provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of the financial reporting and preparation of our financial statements for external use, we could suffer harm to our reputation, fail to meet our public reporting requirements in a timely fashion, be unable to properly report on our business and our results of operations, or be required to restate our financial statements. These circumstances could lead to a significant decrease in the trading price of our shares, or the delisting of our shares from the NYSE AMERICAN, which would harm our shareholders.", "PERMNO": 81190, "SIC": 7363, "TIC": "VOLT"}
