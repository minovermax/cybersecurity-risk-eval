{"cik": "1493761", "company": "Turtle Beach Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-02", "item_1A": "Item 1A - Risk Factors\nSet forth below is a summary of certain material risks related to an investment in our securities, which should be considered carefully in evaluating such an investment. Our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including but not limited to those described below, any one or more of which could, directly or indirectly, cause the Company\u2019s actual results of operations and financial condition to vary materially from past, or from anticipated future, results of operations and financial condition. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and common stock price. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also impair our business operations.\nBecause of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. Please also see \u201cStatement Regarding Forward-Looking Disclosures\u201d in the section immediately preceding Item 1 of this Report.\nRisks Related to COVID-19\nThe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nThe effects of the public health crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and its variant strains, and the measures being taken in response are uncertain and difficult to predict, but may include:\n\u2022\nA decrease in the demand and/or pricing for our products, and a global economic recession that could reduce demand and/or pricing for our products, resulting from actions taken by governments, businesses, and/or the general public in an effort to limit exposure to and spreading of such infectious diseases, such as travel restrictions, quarantines, and business shutdowns or slowdowns;\n\u2022\nDisruptions to our supply chain in connection with the sourcing, manufacturing and transportation of finished goods and materials, in particular, the negative impact to lead-times and availability of semiconductor components which could lead to shortages preventing us from manufacturing products in the required quantities to support demand;\n\u2022\nIncreased difficulty in new product development due to inability to collaborate on-site with manufacturing partners;\n\u2022\nDisruptions in foot traffic to brick-and-mortar retail locations of our retailers resulting from the reinstatement of operational restrictions or temporary closures of retailing operations could disrupt retail customer awareness and demand for our products;\n\u2022\nNegative impacts to our operations, including reductions in efficiency and productivity and increased costs resulting from efforts to mitigate the impact of COVID-19;\n\u2022\nDeterioration of worldwide credit and financial markets that could limit our ability to obtain financing, result in losses due to failures of financial institutions and other parties, and cause a higher rate of losses on our accounts receivables due to defaults and bankruptcies; and\n\u2022\nDeterioration of the financial condition or liquidity, or interruptions to the operations, of our suppliers and customers, including retailers and distributions, could adversely affect the distribution, availability and sales of our products.\nAdditionally, as a result of operational and government restrictions on retailing operations due to COVID-19, retailers have experienced, and may continue to experience, liquidity constraints or other financial difficulties, which could lead to a reduction in the amount of merchandise purchased from us, an increase in order cancellations or the need to extend payment terms. Any or all of these measures could substantially reduce revenue or have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe resumption of normal business operations after such interruptions may be delayed or constrained by lingering effects of COVID-19 on our employees, suppliers, manufactures, distributors, retailers, third-party service providers, and/or customers. We have seen an increase in demand for our products during the COVID-19 pandemic and may see a decrease in demand for our products as restrictions imposed for the pandemic are lifted and social functions and activities start returning to pre-pandemic levels.\nThese effects, alone or taken together, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. An extended period of global supply chain and economic disruption resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and the government measures adopted in response thereto could exacerbate the foregoing effects. In addition, the potential impacts of COVID-19 also could affect many of our risk factors included in Item 1A of this Annual Report. However, as the COVID-19 situation is unprecedented and continuously evolving, the potential impacts to such risk factors remain uncertain.\nThe ongoing global economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant challenges for global supply chains resulting in inflationary cost pressures and component shortages. We have also experienced unique logistical challenges related to transportation delays. As a result, we have incurred incremental costs for commodities and components used in our products as well as component shortages that have negatively impacted our sales and results of operations. We expect that these challenges will continue to have an impact on our businesses for the foreseeable future. We continue to take proactive steps to continue to limit the impact of these challenges and are working closely with our suppliers to manage availability of products and implement other cost savings initiatives.\nRisks Related to Our Operations\nThe manufacture, supply and shipment of our products are subject to supply chain and logistics risks that could adversely impact our financial results.\nWe face a number of risks related to supply chain management and logistics with respect to our products. Recently, we have experienced, and may in the future experience, supply or labor shortages or other disruptions to our supply chain or logistics, which could result in shipping delays and increased costs, each of which could negatively impact our results, operations, product development, and sales. The extent and duration of the impact of these challenges are subject to numerous factors, including the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, behavioral changes, wage and price costs, adoption of new or revised regulations, and broader macroeconomic conditions.\nIn 2021, we experienced supply chain disruptions that resulted in significant cost increases. For example, the recent market shortage of semiconductors has caused disruptions, from both a supply and pricing standpoint. Recent inflationary pressures have been exacerbated by the lower availability of, and increased prices for, freight and logistics, including air, sea, and ground freight. The Company may not be able to pass along these price increases to its customers. While the Company has taken and continues to take measures to procure and maintain levels of inventory to prioritize product availability amidst global supply chain and logistical challenges, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to continue to do so. Accordingly, any future delays, disruptions, and supply and pricing risks, such as the ongoing supply chain challenges and disruptions that we expect to continue during 2022, could affect our ability to meet customer demand for our products, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe manufacture, supply and shipment of our products are dependent upon a limited number of third parties, and our success is dependent upon the ability of these parties to manufacture, supply and ship sufficient quantities of our products to us in a timely fashion, as well as the continued viability and financial stability of these third-parties. In addition, many of our products use components with long order lead times and constrained supply. Any disruption in supply of these components could materially impact the ability of our third- party manufacturing partners to produce our products.\nWe rely on third parties to manufacture and manage the logistics of transporting and distributing our products, which subjects us to a number of risks that have been exacerbated as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing supply chain issues associated therewith. Our manufacturers\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 ability to supply products to us is also subject to a number of risks, including the availability of raw materials or components, their financial instability, the destruction of their facilities, epidemics, or work stoppages. Any shortage of raw materials or components or an inability to control costs associated with manufacturing could increase our costs or impair our ability to ship orders in a timely and cost-efficient manner. As a result, we could experience cancellations of orders, refusal to accept deliveries or a reduction in our prices and margins, any of which could harm our financial performance and results of operations.\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 has led to work and travel restrictions globally which in turn has led to factory closures, interruptions in supply chains, increased regulation, and workforce shortages. These issues and others may make it difficult for our suppliers and manufacturers to source raw materials or components, manufacture finished goods and export our products. There may be significant and material disruptions to our supply chain and operations, and delays in the manufacture and shipment of our products, which may then have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nWe could be negatively affected if we are not able to engage third parties with the necessary capabilities or capacity on reasonable terms, or if those we engage with fail to meet their obligations (whether due to financial difficulties, manufacturing constraints, or other reasons). Moreover, there can be no assurance that such manufacturers and suppliers will not refuse to supply us at prices we deem acceptable, independently market their own competing products in the future, or otherwise discontinue their relationships with us. Our failure to maintain these existing manufacturing and supplier relationships, or to establish new relationships on similar terms in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nIn particular, certain of our products have a number of components and subassemblies produced by outside suppliers. In addition, for certain of these items, we qualify only a single source of supply with long lead times, which can magnify the risk of shortages or result in excess supply and also decreases our ability to negotiate price with our suppliers. Also, if we experience quality problems with suppliers, then our production schedules could be significantly delayed or costs significantly increased, which could have an adverse effect on our business, liquidity, results of operation and financial position.\nIn addition, the ongoing effectiveness of our supply chain is dependent on the timely performance of services by third parties shipping products and materials to and from our warehouse facilities and other locations. If we encounter problems with these shipments, our ability to meet retailer expectations, manage inventory, complete sales, and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies could be materially adversely\naffected and we may be required to incur materially higher costs for shipping, including air freight. We have experienced some of these problems in the past and we cannot assure you that we will not experience similar problems in the future.\nWe depend upon the success and availability of third-party gaming platforms and release of certain game titles to drive sales of our headset products.\nThe performance of our headset business is affected by the continued success of third-party gaming platforms, such as Microsoft\u2019s Xbox\u00ae consoles and Sony\u2019s PlayStation\u00ae consoles, as well as video games developed by such manufacturers and other third-party publishers. Our business could suffer if any of these parties fail to continue to drive the success of these platforms, develop new or enhanced videogame platforms, develop popular game and entertainment titles for current or future generation platforms or produce and timely release sufficient quantities of such consoles. Further, if a platform is withdrawn from the market or fails to sell, we may be forced to liquidate inventories relating to that platform or accept returns resulting in significant losses.\nOur brands face significant competition from other consumer electronics companies and this competition could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe compete with other producers of gaming accessories, including the video game console manufacturers. Our competitors may undertake more extensive marketing campaigns, adopt more aggressive pricing policies, or develop more commercially successful products for the PC and video game platforms than we do. In addition, competitors with large product lines and popular products, in particular the video game console manufacturers, typically have greater leverage with retailers, distributors, and other customers, who may be willing to promote products with less consumer appeal in return for access to those competitors\u2019 more popular products.\nIn the event that a competitor reduces prices, we could be forced to respond by lowering our prices to remain competitive. If we are forced to lower prices, we may be required to \u201cprice protect\u201d products that remain unsold in our customers\u2019 inventories at the time of the price reduction. Price protection results in our issuing a credit to our customers in the amount of the price reduction for each unsold unit in that customer\u2019s inventory. Our price protection policies, which are customary in the industry, can have a major impact on our profitability. Also, any actions we undertake to increase prices in response to rising inflation or other considerations may reduce demand for our product and have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nConversely, any actions we undertake to increase prices in response to rising costs due to higher inflation levels or other considerations may reduce demand for our product if our competitors do not follow with similar pricing actions. This may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nThe industries in which we operate are subject to competition in an environment of rapid technological change, and if we do not adapt to, and appropriately allocate our resources among, emerging technologies, our revenues could be negatively affected.\nWe must make substantial product development and other investments to align our product portfolio and development efforts in response to market changes in the gaming industry. We must anticipate and adapt our products to emerging technologies in order to keep those products competitive. When we choose to incorporate a new technology into our products or to develop a product for a new platform or operating system, we are often required to make a substantial investment prior to the introduction of the product. If we invest in the development of a new technology or for a new platform that does not achieve significant commercial success, our revenues from those products likely will be lower than anticipated and may not cover our costs. Further, our competitors may develop or adapt to an emerging technology more quickly or effectively than we do, creating products that are technologically superior to ours, more appealing to consumers, or both.\nNew and emerging technologies and alternate platforms for gaming, such as mobile devices and virtual reality devices, could make the consoles for which our headsets are designed less attractive or, in time, obsolete, which could require us to transition our business model such as develop products for other gaming platforms.\nThere are numerous steps required to develop a product from conception to commercial introduction and to ensure timely shipment to retail customers, including designing, sourcing, and testing the electronic components, receiving approval of hardware and other third-party licensors, factory availability and manufacturing and designing the graphics and packaging. Any difficulties or delays in the product development process will likely result in delays in the contemplated product introduction schedule. It is common in new product introductions or product updates to encounter technical and other difficulties affecting manufacturing efficiency and, at times, the ability to manufacture the product at all. Although these difficulties can be corrected or improved over time with continued manufacturing experience and engineering efforts, if one or more aspects necessary for the introduction of products are not completed as scheduled, or if technical difficulties take longer than anticipated to overcome, the product introductions will be delayed, or in some cases may be terminated. No assurances can be given that our products will be introduced in a timely fashion, and if new products are delayed, our sales and revenue growth may be limited or impaired.\nA significant portion of our revenue is derived from a few large customers, and the loss of any such customer, or a significant reduction in purchases by such customer, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nDuring 2021, our three largest individual customers accounted for approximately 41% of our gross sales in the aggregate. The loss of, or financial difficulties experienced by, any of these or any of our other significant customers, including as a result of the bankruptcy of a customer, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. We do not have long-term agreements with these or other significant customers and our agreements with these customers do not require them to purchase any specific amount of products. All of our customers generally purchase from us on a purchase order basis. As a result, agreements with respect to pricing, returns, cooperative advertising or special promotions, among other things, are subject to periodic negotiation with each customer. No assurance can be given that these or other customers will continue to do business with us or that they will maintain their historical levels of business. In addition, the uncertainty of product orders can make it difficult to forecast our sales and allocate our resources in a manner consistent with actual sales, and our expense levels are based in part on our expectations of future sales. If our expectations regarding future sales are inaccurate, we may be unable to reduce costs in a timely manner to adjust for sales shortfalls. In addition, financial difficulties experienced by a significant customer could increase our exposure to uncollectible receivables and the risk that losses from uncollected receivables exceed the reserves we have set aside in anticipation of this risk or limit our ability to continue to do business with such customers.\nTurtle Beach relies on its partnerships with influencers, athletes and esports teams to expand our market and promote our products, which may not perform to our expectations.\nWe believe that our ability to extend the recognition and favorable perception of our Turtle Beach brand, and the ROCCAT and Neat Microphones brands, is critical to implement our gaming accessory growth strategy, which includes maintaining our strong position in console gaming headsets and building our brand recognition and product appeal in PC gaming headsets, keyboards, and mice as well as in additional new categories over time. These efforts incur significant costs in marketing and these expenditures, however, may not result in a sufficient increase in net sales to cover such costs.\nIf our marketing efforts do not effectively raise the recognition and reputation of our brands, we may not be able to successfully implement our gaming accessory growth strategy.\nRelationships with new and established influencers, athletes and esports teams have been, and will continue to be important to our future success. We rely on these partners to assist us in generating increased acceptance and use of our product offerings. We have established a number of these relationships, and our growth depends in part on establishing new relationships and maintaining existing ones. Certain partners may not view their relationships with us as significant to their own businesses, and they may reassess their commitment to us or decide to partner with our competitors in the future. We cannot guarantee that any partner will perform their obligations as agreed or that we would be able to specifically enforce any agreement with them. If any partner does not perform consistent with our agreements, we may be subject to reputational or social media risks. Additionally, our failure to maintain and expand these relationships may adversely impact our future revenue.\nOur net sales and operating income fluctuate on a seasonal basis and decreases in sales or margins during peak seasons could have a disproportionate effect on our overall financial condition and results of operations.\nHistorically, a significant portion of our annual revenues have been generated during the holiday season of September to December. If we do not accurately forecast demand for products, we could incur additional costs or experience manufacturing delays. Any shortfall in net sales during this period would cause our annual results of operations to suffer significantly.\nDemand for our products depends on many factors such as consumer preferences and the introduction or adoption of game platforms and related content and can be difficult to forecast. If we misjudge the demand for our products, we could face the following problems in our operations, each of which could harm our operating results:\n\u2022\nIf our forecasts of demand for products are too high, we may accumulate excess inventories of products, which could lead to markdown allowances or write-offs affecting some or all of such excess inventories. We may also have to adjust the prices of our existing products to reduce such excess inventories;\n\u2022\nIf demand for specific products increases beyond what we forecast, our suppliers and third-party manufacturers may not be able to increase production or obtain required components quickly enough to meet the demand. Our failure to meet market demand may lead to missed opportunities to increase our base of gamers, damage our relationships with retailers or harm our business; and\n\u2022\nThe on-going transition to new console platforms increases the likelihood that we could fail to accurately forecast demand for headsets and other accessories for these platforms.\nOur results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by global business, political, operational, financial, and economic conditions.\nWe face business, political, operational, financial, and economic risks inherent in international business, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nHigher product component costs and higher transportation and logistics costs driven by increasing rates of inflation globally;\n\u2022\ntrade restrictions, higher tariffs, currency fluctuations or the imposition of additional regulations relating to import or export of our products, especially in China, where many of our Turtle Beach products are manufactured, which could force us to seek alternate manufacturing sources or increase our costs;\n\u2022\ndifficulties obtaining domestic and foreign export, import and other governmental approvals, permits and licenses, and compliance with foreign laws, which could halt, interrupt or delay our operations if we cannot obtain such approvals, permits and licenses;\n\u2022\ncompliance with anti-corruption laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, the European Union Anti-Corruption Act and other similar laws, or non-compliance that could subject us to trade sanctions administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, the U.S. Department of Commerce and equivalent foreign entities;\n\u2022\ndifficulties encountered by our international distributors or us in staffing and managing foreign operations or international sales, including higher labor costs and tightening of the overall labor markets;\n\u2022\ntransportation delays and difficulties of managing international distribution channels;\n\u2022\nlonger payment cycles for, and greater difficulty collecting, accounts receivable;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic instability, including wars, terrorism, political unrest, boycotts, curtailment of trade and other business restrictions, any of which could materially and adversely affect our net sales and results of operations;\n\u2022\npublic health issues (for example, an outbreak of a contagious disease such as COVID-19); and\n\u2022\nnatural disasters.\nAny of these factors could reduce our net sales, decrease our gross margins, increase our expenses, or reduce our profitability. Should we establish our own operations in international territories where we currently utilize a distributor, we will become subject to greater risks associated with operating outside of the United States.\nThe electronics industry in general has historically been characterized by a high degree of volatility and is subject to substantial and unpredictable variations resulting from changing business cycles. Our operating results will be subject to fluctuations based on general economic conditions, and in particular conditions that impact discretionary consumer spending. Downturns in the worldwide economy could adversely affect our business. We could experience a reduction in demand for our products or a lengthening of consumer replacement schedules for our products. Reduced demand for these products could result in decreases in our average selling prices and product sales. A deterioration of current conditions in worldwide credit markets could limit our ability to obtain financing. A lack of available credit in financial markets may adversely affect the ability of our commercial customers to finance purchases and operations and could result in an absence of orders or spending for our products as well as create supplier disruptions. We are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of any adverse economic conditions and disruptions in financial markets and the effects they will have on our business and its financial condition. Difficult economic conditions may also result in a higher rate of losses on our accounts receivables due to defaults or bankruptcies. As a result, a downturn in the worldwide economy could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report financial results or prevent fraud, which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nEffective internal controls are necessary to provide reliable financial reports and to assist in the effective prevention of fraud. Any inability to provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud could harm our business. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires, among other things, that we evaluate our systems and processes and test our internal controls over financial reporting to allow management and our independent registered public accounting firm, as applicable, to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. If we are not able to remediate any identified material weakness or otherwise comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identifies deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, investors could lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our common stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions, investigations by the Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, or shareholder litigation.\nIn addition, failure to maintain effective internal controls could result in financial statements that do not accurately reflect our financial condition or results of operations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain a system of internal controls that fully complies with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 or that our management and independent registered public accounting firm will continue to conclude that our internal controls are effective.\nRisks Related to our Intellectual Property and other Legal Matters\nOur competitive position will be adversely damaged if our products are found to infringe on the intellectual property rights of others.\nOther companies and our competitors may currently own or obtain patents or other proprietary rights that might prevent, limit, or interfere with our ability to make, use, or sell our products. Although we do not believe that our products infringe the proprietary rights of any third parties, we have received notices of alleged infringement in the past and there can be no assurance that infringement or other legal claims will not be asserted against us in the future or that we will not be found to infringe the intellectual property rights of others. The electronics industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights and positions, resulting in significant and often protracted and expensive litigation. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us and our failure or inability to license the infringed technology, our business and operating results could be adversely affected. Any litigation or claims, whether or not valid, could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources. An adverse result from intellectual property litigation could cause us to do one or more of the following:\n\u2022\ncease selling, incorporating or using products or services that incorporate the challenged intellectual property;\n\u2022\nobtain a license from the holder of the infringed intellectual property right, which license may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all; and/or\n\u2022\nredesign products or services that incorporate the disputed technology.\nIf we take any of the foregoing actions, we could face substantial costs and shipment delays and our business could be seriously harmed. Although we carry general liability insurance, our insurance may not cover claims of this type or may be inadequate to insure us for all liability that may be imposed.\nIn addition, it is possible that our customers or end users may seek indemnity from us in the event that our products are found or alleged to infringe the intellectual property rights of others. Any such claim for indemnity could result in substantial costs to us that could adversely impact our operating results.\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain intellectual property rights and/or enforce those rights against third parties who are violating those rights, our business could suffer.\nWe rely on various intellectual property rights, including patents, trademarks, trade secrets and trade dress to protect our Turtle Beach brand name, reputation, product appearance, and technology. Although we have entered into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and nondisclosure agreements with selected parties with whom we conduct business to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information, these contractual arrangements and the other steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not prevent misappropriation of that intellectual property or deter independent third-party development of similar technologies. Monitoring the unauthorized use of proprietary technology and trademarks is costly, and any dispute or other litigation, regardless of outcome, may be costly and time consuming and may divert the attention of management and key personnel from our business operations. The steps taken by us may not prevent unauthorized use of proprietary technology or trademarks. Many features of our products are not protected by patents; we may not have the legal right to prevent others from reverse engineering or otherwise copying and using these features in competitive products. If we fail to protect or to enforce our intellectual property rights successfully, our competitive position could suffer, which could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe are susceptible to counterfeiting of our products, which may harm our reputation for producing high-quality products and force us to incur expenses in enforcing our intellectual property rights. Such claims and lawsuits can be expensive to resolve, require substantial management time and resources, and may not provide a satisfactory or timely result, any of which may harm our results of operations. As some of our products are sold internationally, we are also dependent on the laws of many countries to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights. These laws may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent or in the same manner as the laws of the United States.\nFurther, we are party to licenses that grant us rights to intellectual property, including trademarks, which are necessary or useful to our Turtle Beach business. One or more of our licensors may allege that we have breached our license agreement with them and seek to terminate our license. If successful, this could result in our loss of the right to use the licensed intellectual property, which could adversely affect our ability to commercialize our technologies or products, as well as harm our competitive business position and our business prospects.\nOur success also depends in part on our ability to obtain and enforce intellectual property protection of our technology, particularly our patents. There is no guarantee any patent be granted on any patent application that we have filed or may file. Claims allowed from existing or pending patents may not be of sufficient scope or strength to protect the economic value of our technologies. Further, any patent that we may obtain will expire at some point, and it is possible that it may be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented even prior to expiration.\nWe may initiate claims or litigation against third parties in the future for infringement of our proprietary rights or to determine the scope and validity of our proprietary rights or the proprietary rights of our competitors. These claims could result in costly litigation and divert the\nefforts of our technical and management personnel. As a result, our operating results could be adversely affected, and our financial condition could be negatively impacted.\nWe are dependent upon third-party intellectual property to manufacture some of our products.\nThe performance of certain technology used in new generation consoles, such as integrated voice and chat audio from the Xbox platforms is improved by a licensed component to ensure compatibility with our products.\nWhile we currently believe that we have the necessary licenses, or can obtain the necessary licenses, in order to produce compatible products, there is no guarantee that our licenses will be renewed or granted in the first instance in the future. Moreover, if these first parties enter into license agreements with companies other than us for their \u201cclosed systems\u201d or if we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of these headset adapters or chips, we would be placed at a competitive disadvantage.\nIn order for certain of our headsets to connect to the Xbox platforms\u2019 advanced features and controls, a proprietary computer chip or wireless module is required. As a result, with respect to our products designed for the Xbox platforms, we are currently reliant on Microsoft or their designated supplier to provide us with sufficient quantities. If we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of these headset adapters or chips, sales of such Xbox platform headsets and consequently our revenues would be adversely affected.\nWe are licensed and approved by Microsoft to develop and sell Xbox platform compatible audio products pursuant to a license agreement under which we have the right to manufacture (including through third party manufacturers), market and sell audio products for the Xbox platform video game console. Our current Xbox platform headsets are dependent on this license and headsets for future Xbox consoles may also be dependent on this license. Microsoft has the right to terminate that license under certain circumstances set forth in the agreement. Should that license be terminated, our headset offerings may be limited, which could significantly reduce our revenues. While Sony does not currently require a license for audio products to be compatible with PlayStation\u00ae consoles, they could do so in the future.\nWhile the Company believes it currently has the necessary licenses, or can obtain the necessary licenses to produce compatible products, Microsoft, Sony and other third-party gaming platform manufacturers may control or limit our ability to manufacture headsets compatible with their platforms, and could cause unanticipated delays in the release of our products as well as increases to projected development, manufacturing, licensing, marketing or distribution costs, any of which could negatively impact our business.\nWe have been party to stockholder litigation, and in the future could be party to additional stockholder litigation, any of which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe have had, and may continue to have, actions brought against us by stockholders in connection with the Merger, as further described in Item 3 - Legal Proceedings below, past transactions, changes in our stock price or other matters. Any such claims, whether or not resolved in our favor, could divert our management and other resources from the operation of our business and otherwise result in unexpected and substantial expenses that would adversely and materially impact our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nRisks Related to Liquidity\nIn the past, we have depended upon the availability of capital under our revolving credit facility to finance our operations. Any additional financing that we may need may not be available on favorable terms, or at all.\nIn addition to cash flow generated from operations, we have financed our operations with a credit facility (the \u201cCredit Facility\u201d) provided by Bank of America, as Agent, Sole Lead Arranger and Sole Bookrunner. If we are unable to comply with the financial and other covenants contained in the Credit Facility and are unable to obtain a waiver under the Credit Facility, Bank of America may declare any outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility immediately due and payable. If we had borrowing under the Credit Facility, such an event would have an immediate and material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We could be required to obtain additional financing from other sources, and we cannot predict whether or on what terms, if any, additional financing might be available. If we were required to seek additional financing and were unable to obtain it, we might need to change our business and capital expenditure plans, which may have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, any debt under the Credit Facility could make it more difficult to obtain other debt financing in the future. The Credit Facility contains certain financial covenants and other restrictions that limit our ability, among other things, to incur certain additional indebtedness; pay dividends and repurchase stock; make certain investments and other payments; enter into certain mergers or consolidations; engage in sale and leaseback transactions and transactions with affiliates; and encumber and dispose of assets.\nIf we violate any of these covenants, we will likely be unable to borrow under the Credit Facility. If a default occurs and is not timely cured or waived, Bank of America could seek remedies against us, including termination or suspension of obligations to make loans and issue letters of credit, and acceleration of amounts then outstanding under the applicable Credit Facility. No assurance can be given that we will be able to maintain compliance with these covenants in the future. The Credit Facility is asset based and can only be drawn down in an amount to which eligible collateral exists and can be negatively impacted by extended collection of accounts receivable, unexpectedly high product returns and slow-moving inventory, among other factors. In addition, we have granted the lender a first-priority lien against substantially all of\nour assets, including trade accounts receivable and inventories. Failure to comply with the operating restrictions or financial covenants could result in the lender terminating or suspending its obligation to make loans and issue letters of credit to us.\nAdditionally, a significant downturn in demand for our products or a reduction in gross margins could have a material impact on our result of operations adversely affect our ability to obtain financing.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nOur business could be adversely affected by inflationary pressures.\nWe are exposed to inflationary pressures including higher labor-related costs and potential increases in the costs of the goods and services we purchase as part of the manufacture and distribution of our products and in our operations generally. Such inflationary pressures have been and could continue to be exacerbated by higher oil prices, geopolitical turmoil, and economic policy actions. Our inability to adequately increase prices to offset increased costs associated with such inflationary pressures, or otherwise mitigate their impact, will increase our costs of doing business and reduce our margins and profitability. If such impacts are prolonged and substantial, they could have a material negative effect on our results of operations.\nIf we are unable to protect our information systems against service interruption, misappropriation of data or breaches of security, our operations could be disrupted, our reputation may be damaged, and we may be financially liable for damages.\nWe rely heavily on information systems to manage our operations, including a full range of retail, financial, sourcing, and merchandising systems. We regularly make investments to upgrade, enhance or replace these systems, as well as leverage new technologies to support our growth strategies. In addition, we have implemented enterprise-wide initiatives that are intended to standardize business processes and optimize performance. Further, while many of our employees and certain suppliers with whom we do business operate in a remote working environment during the COVID-19 pandemic, the risk of cybersecurity attacks and data breaches, particularly through phishing attempts, may be increased as we and third-parties with whom we interact leverage our IT infrastructure in previously unanticipated ways during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Any delays or difficulties in transitioning to new systems or integrating them with current systems or the failure to implement our initiatives in an orderly and timely fashion could result in additional investment of time and resources, which could impair our ability to improve existing operations and support future growth, and ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe reliability and capacity of our information systems are critical. Despite preventative efforts, our systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from, among other things, natural disasters, technical malfunctions, inadequate systems capacity, human error, power outages, computer viruses and security breaches. Any disruptions affecting our information systems could have a material adverse impact on our business. In addition, any failure to maintain adequate system security controls to protect our computer assets and sensitive data, including associate and client data, from unauthorized access, disclosure or use could damage our reputation with our associates and our clients, exposing us to financial liability, legal proceedings (such as class action lawsuits), and/or regulatory action. While we have implemented measures to prevent security breaches and cyber incidents, our preventative measures and incident response efforts may not be entirely effective. As a result, we may not be able to immediately detect any security breaches, which may increase the losses that we would suffer. Finally, our ability to continue to operate our business without significant interruption in the event of a disaster or other disruption depends, in part, on the ability of our information systems to operate in accordance with our disaster recovery and business continuity plans.\nOur reliance on information systems and other technology also gives rise to cybersecurity risks, including security breach, espionage, system disruption, theft, and inadvertent release of information. The occurrence of any of these events could compromise our networks, and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost, or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information, disrupt operations, and damage our reputation, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, as security threats continue to evolve, we may need to invest additional resources to protect the security of our systems.\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s exit of the European Union may negatively impact our operations.\nThe changes to the trading relationship between the United Kingdom (UK) and European Union resulting from the UK\u2019s exit from the European Union on January 31, 2020 (\u201cBrexit\u201d) have created uncertainty around possible increased cost of goods imported into and exported from the UK and may decrease the profitability of our UK and other European operations. Additional currency volatility could drive a weaker British pound, which increases the cost of goods imported into our UK operations and may decrease the profitability of our UK operations. A weaker British pound versus the Euro and U.S. dollar also causes local currency results of our UK operations to be translated into fewer U.S. dollars during a reporting period. On December 24, 2020, the UK and the EU entered into a trade and cooperation agreement (the \u201cTrade and Cooperation Agreement\u201d), which was applied on a provisional basis from January 1, 2021, and entered into force on May 1, 2021. The economic integration contemplated by the Trade and Cooperation Agreement does not reach the level that existed during the time the UK was a member state of the EU, and further, while the Trade and Cooperation Agreement sets out preferential arrangements in areas such as trade in goods and in services, digital trade and intellectual property, there is still uncertainty on the application and interpretation of many of its provisions. Negotiations between the UK and the EU are expected to continue in relation to the relationship between the UK and the EU in certain other areas which are not covered by the Trade and Cooperation Agreement. The long-term effects of Brexit will depend on the effects\nof the implementation and application of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement and any other relevant agreements between the UK and the EU.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly.\nWe cannot predict the prices at which our common stock may trade. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate widely, depending on many factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results due to factors related to our business;\n\u2022\nsuccess or failure of our business strategy;\n\u2022\nthe success of third-party gaming platforms and certain game titles to drive sales;\n\u2022\nour quarterly or annual earnings, or those of other companies in our industry;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates;\n\u2022\nour ability to execute transformation, restructuring and realignment actions;\n\u2022\nthe operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies;\n\u2022\noverall market fluctuations; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions and other external factors.\nStock markets in general have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company. These broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. These fluctuations may also cause short sellers to periodically enter the market on the belief that we may experience worse results in the future. We cannot predict the actions of market participants and, therefore, can offer no assurances that the market for our common stock will be stable or appreciate over time.\nLoss of our key management and other personnel could impact our business.\nOur future success depends largely upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key management and technical personnel and on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel. In addition, competition for skilled and non-skilled employees among companies like ours is intense, and the loss of skilled or non-skilled employees or an inability to attract, retain and motivate additional skilled and non-skilled employees required for the operation and expansion of our business could hinder our ability to conduct research activities successfully, develop new products, attract customers, and meet customer shipments.\nOur business could be adversely affected by significant movements in foreign currency exchange rates.\nOur business could be adversely affected by significant movements in foreign currency exchange rates. We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency transaction exchange rates, particularly with respect to the Euro and British Pound. Any significant change in the value of currencies of the countries in which we do business relative to the value of the U.S. dollar could affect our ability to sell products competitively and control our cost structure. Additionally, we are subject to foreign exchange translation risk due to changes in the value of foreign currencies in relation to our reporting currency, the U.S. dollar. The translation risk is primarily concentrated in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the British Pound. As the U.S. dollar fluctuates against other currencies in which we transact business, revenue and income could be impacted.\nAny acquisitions we pursue could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nAs part of our business strategy, we review and intend to continue to review acquisition opportunities that we believe would be advantageous or complementary to the development of our business. If we make any acquisitions, we could take any or all of the following actions, any one of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or share price:\n\u2022\nuse a significant portion of our available cash;\n\u2022\nrequire a significant devotion of management\u2019s time and resources in the pursuit or consummation of such acquisition;\n\u2022\nincur debt, which may not be available to us on favorable terms and may adversely affect our liquidity;\n\u2022\nissue equity or equity-based securities that would dilute existing stockholders\u2019 ownership percentage;\n\u2022\nassume contingent and other liabilities; and\n\u2022\ntake charges in connection with such acquisitions.\nAcquisitions also entail numerous other risks, including, without limitation: difficulties in assimilating acquired operations, products, technologies, and personnel; unanticipated costs; diversion of management\u2019s attention from existing operations; risks of entering markets in which we have limited or no prior experience; regulatory approvals; unanticipated costs or liabilities; and potential loss of key employees from either our existing business or the acquired organization. Acquisitions may result in accounting charges for restructuring and other expenses, amortization of purchased technology and intangible assets and stock-based compensation expense, any of which could materially and adversely affect our operating results. We may not be able to realize the anticipated synergies, innovation, operational efficiencies, benefits of or successfully integrate with our existing business the businesses, products, technologies, or personnel that we acquire, and our failure to do so could harm our business and operating results.\nOur products may be subject to warranty claims, product liability and product recalls.\nWe may be subject to product liability or warranty claims that could result in significant direct or indirect costs, or we could experience greater returns from retailers than expected, which could harm our net sales. The occurrence of any quality problems due to defects in our products could make us liable for damages and warranty claims in excess of any existing reserves. In addition to the risk of direct costs to correct any defects, warranty claims, product recalls or other problems, any negative publicity related to the perceived quality of our products could also affect our brand image, decrease retailer and distributor demand and our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected. Changes in production levels or processes could result in increased manufacturing errors, as well as higher component, manufacturing, and shipping costs, all of which could reduce our profit margins, result in prices increases and harm our relationships with retailers and consumers.\nWe could incur unanticipated expenses in connection with warranty or product liability claims relating to a recall of one or more of our products, which could require significant expenditures to defend. Additionally, we may be required to comply with governmental requirements to remedy the defect and/or notify consumers of the problem that could lead to unanticipated expense, and possible product liability litigation against a customer or us.\nChanges in laws or regulations or the manner of their interpretation or enforcement could adversely impact our financial performance and restrict our ability to operate our business or execute our strategies.\nNew laws or regulations, or changes in existing laws or regulations or the manner of their interpretation or enforcement, may create uncertainty for public companies, increase our cost of doing business and restrict our ability to operate our business or execute our strategies. This could include, among other things, compliance costs and enforcement under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.\nWe continually evaluate and monitor developments with respect to new and proposed laws, regulations, standards, and rules and cannot predict or estimate the amount of the additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs. Any such new or changed laws, regulations, standards, and rules may be subject to varying interpretations and as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure. If our efforts to comply with new or changed laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us, and we may be harmed.\nWe are subject to various environmental laws and regulations that could impose substantial costs on us and may adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nOur operations and some of our products are regulated under various federal, state, local and international environmental laws. In addition, regulatory bodies in many of the jurisdictions in which we operate propose, enact, and amend environmental laws and regulations on a regular basis. If we were to violate or become liable under these environmental laws, we could be required to incur additional costs to comply with such regulations and may incur fines and civil or criminal sanctions, third-party property damage or personal injury claims, or could be required to incur substantial investigation or remediation costs. Liability under environmental laws may be joint and several and without regard to comparative fault. The ultimate costs under environmental laws and the timing of these costs are difficult to predict. Although we cannot predict the ultimate impact of any new environmental laws and regulations, such laws may result in additional costs or decreased revenue and could require that we redesign or change how we manufacture our products, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Additionally, to the extent that our competitors choose not to abide by these environmental laws and regulations, we may be at a cost disadvantage, thereby hindering our ability to effectively compete in the marketplace.", "PERMNO": 13328, "SIC": 3651, "TIC": "HEAR"}
