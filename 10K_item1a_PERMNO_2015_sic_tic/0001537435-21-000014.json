{"cik": "1537435", "company": "TECOGEN INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-18", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business, operations, and Tecogen face many risks. In additional to the other information in this Form 10-K, the following factors and the information contained under the heading ''Cautionary Note Concerning Forward-Looking Statements'' should be considered in evaluating Tecogen and its business. The risks described below may not be the only risks we face.\nTECOGEN INC.\nAdditional risks that we do not yet know of, or that we currently think are immaterial, may also impair our business operations or financial results. If any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nRisks Relating to Our Business Strategy and Industry\nOur financial condition and results of operations have been and may be materially adversely affected by the recent 2019 novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak.\nThe outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus has developed into a global pandemic that could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. These effects have and could continue to include disruptions or restrictions on our employees\u2019 ability to travel, including our service technicians and in-house and outside sales personnel, as well as temporary closures of our manufacturing and other facilities or the facilities of our customers, suppliers, or other vendors in our supply chain. In addition, the coronavirus has resulted in a widespread health crisis that has adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, the economies and financial markets of many countries, resulting in an economic downturn and may result in a global recession that could affect demand for our products or our ability to obtain financing for our business or projects. These events, have and may continue to result in further disruptions to our supply chain, customer demand, our ability to secure new or additional orders and customers, our manufacturing and servicing capabilities, our ability to install new projects, and could materially and adversely affect our business and our results of operations. During the year ended December 31, 2020, our revenues were negatively impacted due to customer order delays or deferrals; service delays due to customer facility closures, in some cases for extended periods; and, a reduction in our energy production distribution, due to business closures and increased remote work and learning environments. The extent to which the coronavirus will continue to impact our business and our financial results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. Such developments may include the continued geographic spread of the virus, the ultimate severity of the disease, the duration of the outbreak, the actions that may be taken by various governmental authorities in response to the outbreak, such as securing sufficient anti-virus medication, the ability of health authorities to distribute and inoculate the population, continued or new requirements to quarantine or \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d and continued or new business closures imposed by numerous states within the United States, and the possible impact on the U.S. or global economy. Significant portions of our business are deemed \u201cessential services\u201d under various state shelter-in-place orders, and we have been able to maintain critical manufacturing and service operations. There can be no assurances, however, that we will be able to maintain these operations at full or limited capacity as conditions change. We operate an essential service which means we must take every effort to keep our employees who operate our business safe and minimize unnecessary risk of exposure to the virus. As part of our pandemic response plan, our sales, engineering, and select administrative functions may be operated remotely when necessary or appropriate while our manufacturing and service teams continues to function normally, subject to customer-initiated disruptions in service.\nDue to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on our customers, including the closure of certain customers' facilities and difficulties that customers may have in maintaining their business and operations during the pandemic, collections from certain existing customers have been and may continue to be deferred or difficult or impossible to collect, that there may be delays in the implementation of current projects and the completion of sales of our products and services.\nTo the extent cash generated from operations in the future is insufficient to fund our operating requirements, we will be required to seek additional outside financing. Our inability to obtain necessary capital or financing to fund these working capital needs will adversely affect our ability to expand our operations.\nIf the cash generated by operations and the proceeds of the CARES Act, as amended (\"CARES Act\") loans we have obtained or may obtain in the future are insufficient to fund our future operating requirements, we will need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financings. Such financing may not be available to us when needed, or if available, may not be available on terms that are favorable to us and could result in significant dilution to the holdings of our stockholders. Furthermore, any such debt financing is likely to include financial and other covenants that may impede our ability to react to changes in the economy or industry.\nOn April 17, 2020, we were granted a loan of $1,874,200 under the Paycheck Protection Program established pursuant to the CARES Act to provide relief to certain businesses as a result of the pandemic. The loan was provided to us by Webster Bank, N.A. and was guaranteed by the United States Small Business Administration (\u201cSBA\u201d). We utilized the loan for payroll, rent, and utilities during the applicable covered period. Effective January 11, 2021, the loan together with all accrued interest thereon was forgiven by the SBA in full.\nOn May 11, 2020, we terminated our $10 million line of credit with Webster Business Credit Corporation (\"Webster\"), together with related agreements including a Revolving Note, Security Agreement, Blocked Account Agreement, and Master Letter of Credit Agreement.\nTECOGEN INC.\nOn February 5, 2021, we obtained a Second Draw Paycheck Protection Program unsecured loan in the amount of $1,874,269 through Webster Bank, pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program under the CARES Act and is guaranteed by the SBA. We intend to use the loan proceeds for payroll, rent, utilities and other operating expenses, and expect to apply for forgiveness of the loan balance as permitted under the CARES Act. There can be no assurance that the Second Draw Paycheck Protection Program loan will ultimately be forgiven. See Note 10. \"Note Payable and Revolving Line of Credit, Bank\u201d in our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nBased upon our operating and cash flow plan and the proceeds of our PPP loans, we believe existing resources, including cash and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs for the next twelve months. If adequate financing is not available when needed, we may be required to implement cost-cutting strategies, delay production, curtail research and development efforts, or implement other measures, which may adversely affect our overall results of operations and financial condition and the price of our stock.\nIf we experience a period of significant growth or expansion, it could place a substantial strain on our resources.\nIf our cogeneration and chiller products penetrate the market rapidly, we may be unable to deliver large volumes of technically complex products or components to our customers on a timely basis and at a reasonable cost to us. We have never ramped up our manufacturing capabilities to meet significant large-scale production requirements. If we were to commit to deliver large volumes of products, we may not be able to satisfy these commitments on a timely and cost-effective basis.\nOur operating history is characterized by net losses and there can be no assurance we will be able to increase our sales and sustain profitability in the future.\nWe have historically incurred annual operating losses, including a net loss of $6.2 million for 2020 and $4.7 million for 2019. Our Product and Services segment is capital intensive and, because our products generally are built to order with customized configurations, the lead time to build and deliver a unit can be significant. We may be required to purchase key components long before we can deliver a unit and receive payment. Changes in customer orders or lack of demand may also impact our profitability. There can be no assurance we will be able to increase our sales and achieve and sustain profitability in the future.\nWe are dependent on a limited number of third-party suppliers for the supply of key components for our products.\nWe use third-party suppliers for components in all of our products. Our engine supplier, generator supplier for cogeneration products (other than the InVerde), and the compressor and vessel sets in our chillers, are all purchased from large multinational equipment manufacturers. The loss of one or more of our suppliers could materially and adversely affect our business if we are unable to replace them. While alternate suppliers for the manufacture of our engine, generators and compressors have been identified, should the need arise, there can be no assurance that alternate suppliers will be available and able to provide such items on acceptable terms or on a timely basis.\nFrom time to time, shipments of components for our products can be delayed because of industry-wide or other shortages of necessary materials and components from third-party suppliers, as well as shipping delays at points of importation. A supplier's failure to supply components in a timely manner, or to supply components that meet our quality, quantity, or cost requirements, or our inability to obtain substitute sources of these components on a timely basis or on terms acceptable to us, could impair our ability to deliver our products in accordance with contractual obligations.\nThe amount of our backlog is subject to fluctuation due to our customers\u2019 experiencing unexpected delays in financing, permitting or modifications in specifications of the equipment.\nOur total product and installation backlog as of December 31, 2020 was $8.3 million compared to $22.4 million as of 2019. Although we expect our customers to issue definitive purchase orders with respect to such backlog, there can be no assurance that such amounts will not be subject to modification in the event customers experience unexpected delays in obtaining permits, interconnection agreements or financing. As a consequence of COVID-19, we have experienced order delays and deferrals for our products due to business closures or the inability to obtain government issued permits to conduct product installations. Any of such events may result in customers modifying the equipment or the terms or timing of the expected installation, which may result in changes to the amount of backlog attributed to those projects.\nWe experience significant fluctuations in revenues from quarter to quarter on our product sales which may make period to period comparisons difficult.\nWe have low volume, high dollar sales for projects that are generally non-recurring, and therefore our sales have fluctuated significantly from period to period. Fluctuations cannot be predicted because they are affected by the purchasing decisions and timing requirements of our customers, which are unpredictable. Such fluctuations may make quarter to quarter and year to year comparisons difficult.\nTECOGEN INC.\nWe expect significant competition for our products and services.\nMany of our competitors and potential competitors are well established and have substantially greater financial, research and development, technical, manufacturing and marketing resources than we do. If these larger competitors decide to focus on the development of distributed power or cogeneration, they have the manufacturing, marketing and sales capabilities to complete research, development, and commercialization of these products more quickly and effectively than we can. There can also be no assurance that current and future competitors will not develop new or enhanced technologies or more cost-effective systems, and therefore, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in this competitive environment.\nWe may not achieve production cost reductions necessary to competitively price our products, which would adversely affect our sales.\nWe believe that we will need to reduce the unit production cost of our products over time to maintain our ability to offer competitively priced products. Our ability to achieve cost reductions will depend on our ability to develop low-cost design enhancements, to obtain necessary tooling and favorable supplier contracts, and to increase sales volumes so we can achieve economies of scale. We can make no assurance that we will be able to achieve any such production cost reductions. Our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur products involve a lengthy sales cycle and we may not anticipate sales levels appropriately, which could impair our results of operations.\nThe sale of our products typically involves a significant commitment of capital by customers, with the attendant delays frequently associated with large capital expenditures. For these and other reasons, the sales cycle associated with our products is typically lengthy and subject to a number of significant risks over which we have little or no control. We expect to plan our production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand, which is highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially. If sales in any period fall significantly below anticipated levels, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow would suffer. If demand in any period increases well above anticipated levels, we may have difficulties in responding, incur greater costs to respond, or be unable to fulfill the demand in sufficient time to retain the order, which would negatively impact our operations. In addition, our operating expenses are based on anticipated sales levels, and a high percentage of our expenses are generally fixed in the short term. As a result of these factors, a small fluctuation in timing of sales can cause operating results to vary materially from period to period.\nThe economic viability of our projects depends on the price spread between fuel and electricity, and the variability of these prices creates a risk that our projects will not be economically viable and that potential customers will avoid such energy price risks.\nThe economic viability of our CHP products depends on the spread between natural gas fuel and electricity prices. Volatility in one component of the spread, such as the cost of natural gas and other fuels (e.g., propane or distillate oil), can be managed to some extent by means of futures contracts. However, the regional rates charged for both base load and peak electricity may decline periodically due to excess generating capacity or general economic recessions.\nOur products and on-site utility service could become less competitive if electric rates were to fall substantially in the future, although, historically, electric rates have not had any sustained decline in price. Potential customers may perceive the risk of unpredictable swings in natural gas and electricity prices as a risk of investing in on-site CHP, and may decide not to purchase CHP products.\nWe may make acquisitions or take other corporate strategic actions that could harm our financial performance.\nTo expedite development of our business, including with regard to equipment installation and service functions, we anticipate investigating and potentially pursuing future acquisitions of complementary businesses. Risks associated with such acquisitions include the diversion of management attention and cash from operations to cover the costs associated with acquisitions, disruption of our existing operations, loss of key personnel in the acquired companies, dilution through the issuance of additional securities, assumptions of existing liabilities, and commitment to further increase operating expenses. If any or all of these problems actually occur, acquisitions could negatively impact our financial performance and future stock value.\nWe completed our merger with ADGE in May 2017. As we complete the integration of ADGE's assets and business model into its operations, our financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nExpiring customer contracts may lead to decreases in revenue and increases in expenses.\nEach year, a portion of our customer contracts expire and need to be renewed or replaced. We may not be able to renew or extend contracts with existing customers or obtain replacement contracts at attractive rates or for the same term as the expiring contracts. To the extent we are unable to extend customer contracts prior to their expiration date, energy production revenue will decline due to less energy billing. Expiring customer contracts can also lead to an increase in expenses because we\nTECOGEN INC.\nare obligated to remove the equipment from the customer location at our own expense at the end of the customer contract. The investment required to obtain replacement contracts, to include the manufacture and installation of the cogeneration or chiller equipment and the costs to incorporate this equipment into a facility are significant. To the extent that we do not have sufficient liquidity, may have an adverse impact on our ability to add new energy contracted sites.\nOur revenue from energy billing may be adversely impacted by reductions in utility rates for electrical power, by the weather, or by an increase in remote work environment, all of which could reduce our revenue.\nOver the past several years, there has been a sharp decrease in electric rates, subsequent to the vast majority of customer contract dates, causing the billable value of the electrical power generated by our systems to decrease which has an adverse effect on our results of operations. In warmer months the customers do not use as much thermal energy because they do not have as much demand for heat at their locations. Due to lower demand in warmer months we may not be able to bill for thermal energy and in turn may have a decrease in revenue. Also, the increase in the number of student and employees conducting their studies or work remotely, which has accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic, has resulted in a significant decrease in commercial electricity generated by our systems, which has resulted in decreased revenues and has adversely effected our results of operations.\nOur financial condition and results of operations could suffer if there is an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our goodwill was $2,406,156, and our intangible assets were $1,360,319. We recognized goodwill impairment relating to our energy production segment of $2,875,711 and $3,693,198 in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We are required to test intangible assets with indefinite lives, including goodwill, annually or, in certain instances, more frequently, and may be required to record impairment charges, which would reduce any earnings or increase any loss for the period in which the impairment was determined to have occurred. Our goodwill impairment analysis is sensitive to changes in key assumptions used in our analysis. If the assumptions used in our analysis are not realized, it is possible that an impairment charge may need to be recorded in the future. We cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets. However, any such impairment would have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Technology and Business Operations\nIf we are unable to maintain our technological expertise in design and manufacturing processes, we will not be able to successfully compete.\nWe believe that our future success will depend upon our ability to continue to develop and provide innovative products and product enhancements that meet the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers.\nHowever, this requires that we successfully anticipate and respond to technological changes in design and manufacturing processes in a cost-effective and timely manner. The development of new, technologically advanced products and enhancements is a complex and uncertain process requiring high levels of innovation, as well as the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends. There can be no assurance that we will successfully identify new product opportunities, develop and bring new or enhanced products to market in a timely manner, successfully lower costs, and achieve market acceptance of our products, or that products and technologies developed by others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive.\nThe introduction of products embodying new technologies and the shifting of customer demands or changing industry standards could render our existing products obsolete and unmarketable. We may experience delays in releasing new products and product enhancements in the future. Material delays in introducing new products or product enhancements may cause customers to forego purchases of our products and purchase those of our competitors.\nLegal, Regulatory and Compliance Risks\nOur business is subject to product liability and warranty claims.\nOur business exposes us to potential product liability claims, which are inherent in the manufacturing, marketing and sale of our products, and we may face substantial liability for damages resulting from the faulty design of products, manufacture of products or improper use of products by end users. We currently maintain a moderate level of product liability insurance, but there can be no assurance that this insurance will provide sufficient coverage in the event of a claim. Also, we cannot predict whether we will be able to maintain such coverage on acceptable terms, if at all, or that a product liability claim would not harm our business or financial condition. In addition, negative publicity in connection with the faulty design or manufacture of our products would adversely affect our ability to market and sell our products.\nTECOGEN INC.\nWe sell our products with limited warranties. There can be no assurance that the provision in our financial statements for estimated product warranty expense will be sufficient. We cannot ensure that our efforts to reduce our risk through warranty disclaimers will effectively limit our liability. Any significant occurrence of warranty expense in excess of estimates could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and cash flow. Further, we have at times undertaken programs to enhance the performance of units previously sold. These enhancements have at times been provided at no cost or below our cost. If we choose to offer such programs again in the future, such actions could result in significant costs.\nAgreements with our customers may include potential liquidated damages relating to construction delays or performance guaranties.\nTurnkey construction contracts to which we are a party may contain liquidated damages provisions resulting from failure to achieve agreed milestones relating to construction activity. Agreements relating to the sale of equipment or energy may include performance and other obligations that may result in payment obligations to customers.\nUtilities or governmental entities could hinder our entry into and growth in the marketplace, and we may not be able to effectively sell our products.\nUtilities or governmental entities on occasion have placed barriers to the installation of our products or their interconnection with the electric grid, and they may continue to do so. Utilities may charge additional fees to customers who install on-site CHP and rely on the grid for back-up power. These types of restrictions, fees, or charges could make it harder for customers to install our products or use them effectively, as well as increasing the cost to our potential customers. This could make our systems less desirable, thereby adversely affecting our revenue and other operating results.\nThe reduction, elimination or expiration of government and economic incentives for applications of our equipment could reduce demand for our equipment and harm our business.\nThe market for cogeneration equipment depends in part on the availability and size of government and economic incentives that vary by geographic market. Because our sales to customers are typically into geographic areas with such incentives, elimination, or expiration of government subsidies and economic incentives for cogeneration equipment may negatively affect the competitiveness of equipment relative to other sources of electricity, heating, and cooling equipment, and could harm or halt the growth of the cogeneration industry and our business. In particular, the Company depends on the New York State Energy Development Authority CHP Program (PON 2568) and the New Jersey Smart Start Combined Heat and Power Incentive.\nWe may incorporate price reduction on equipment sold to customers based on the anticipated receipt of governmental economic incentive payments and apply and collect the incentives payments. If such incentives become unavailable to us our financial condition may be adversely affected.\nCompeting sources of electricity, heating, and cooling equipment may successfully lobby for changes in the relevant legislation in their markets that are harmful to the cogeneration industry. Reductions in, or eliminations or expirations of, governmental incentives in regions where we focus our sales efforts could result in decreased demand for and lower revenue from cogeneration equipment there, which would adversely affect us. In addition, our ability to successfully penetrate new geographic markets may depend on new geographic areas adopting and maintaining incentives to promote cogeneration, to the extent such incentives are not currently in place. Additionally, electric utility companies may establish pricing structures or interconnection requirements that could adversely affect our sales and be harmful to cogeneration.\nWe may be exposed to substantial liability claims if we fail to fulfill our obligations to our customers or our on-site equipment malfunctions.\nWe enter into contracts with large commercial and not-for-profit customers under which we assume responsibility for meeting a portion of the customers' building energy demand and equipment installation. We may be exposed to substantial liability claims if we fail to fulfill our obligations to customers. If the equipment malfunctions, it may be costly to repair or replace. There can be no assurance that we will not be vulnerable to claims by customers and by third parties that are beyond any contractual protections that we are able to negotiate. As a result, liability claims could cause us significant financial harm.\nWe may be subject to litigation, which is expensive and could divert management attention.\nOur share price may be volatile and in the past companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to an increased incidence of securities class action litigation. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business.\nAlthough we maintain directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance coverage, there can be no assurances that this insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover the substantial fees and expenses of lawyers and other professional advisors relating to any future litigation, our obligations to indemnify our officers and directors who are or may become parties to such pending and\nTECOGEN INC.\nfuture actions, or the amount of any judgments or settlements that we may be obligated to pay in connection with such actions. We may be required to make material payments in connection with the defense of or to settle such litigation or to satisfy any adverse judgment. In addition, actions that arise in the future could be excluded from coverage or, if covered, could exceed our deductibles and/or the coverage provided. In addition, an adverse outcome of litigation could cause our insurance premiums and retention amounts to increase in the future. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For more information regarding litigation, see \"Item 3. Legal Proceedings\" and Note 11 \"Commitments and Contingencies\" in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere herein.\nCredit and Liquidity Risks\nWe are exposed to credit risks with respect to some of our customers.\nTo the extent our customers do not advance us sufficient funds to finance our costs during the execution phase of our contracts, we are exposed to the risk that they may be unable to accept delivery or that they will be unable to make payment at the time of delivery or within agreed upon payment terms. Our provision for doubtful accounts receivable increased $608,397 in the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. We have experienced customer payment delays due to COVID-19, which are attributable to temporary business shutdowns, resulting in declines in revenues and cash flows from our customers and delays in project completion due to delays in government project inspections and a general slowdown in business activity and in some cases, customers ceasing business activities altogether.\nRisks Relating to Ownership of our Common Stock\nInvestment in our Common Stock is subject to price fluctuations and market volatility.\nHistorically, valuations of many small companies have been highly volatile. The securities of many small companies have experienced significant price and trading volume fluctuations unrelated to the operating performance or the prospects of such companies. The market price of shares of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to many risk factors listed in this section, and others beyond our control, including:\n\u2022results and timing of our product development;\n\u2022results of the development of our competitors\u2019 products;\n\u2022regulatory actions with respect to our products or our competitors\u2019 products;\n\u2022actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results;\n\u2022actual or anticipated changes in our growth rate relative to our competitors;\n\u2022actual or anticipated fluctuations in our competitors\u2019 operating results or changes in their growth rate;\n\u2022competition from existing products or new products that may emerge;\n\u2022announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, collaborations, or capital commitments;\n\u2022issuance of new or updated research or reports by securities analysts;\n\u2022fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;\n\u2022share price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares;\n\u2022additions or departures of key management or personnel;\n\u2022disputes or other developments related to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters, and our ability to obtain, maintain, defend or enforce proprietary rights relating to our products and technologies;\n\u2022announcement or expectation of additional financing efforts;\n\u2022sales of our Common Stock by us, our insiders, or our other stockholders; and\n\u2022general economic and market conditions.\nFurthermore, during the COVID-19 pandemic and at other times, the U.S. stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political, and market conditions such as recessions, interest rate changes, or international currency fluctuations, may negatively impact the market price of shares of our common stock. In addition, such fluctuations could subject us to securities class action litigation, which could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could potentially harm our business.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline.\nTECOGEN INC.\nThe trading market for our shares will depend on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. There can be no assurance that analysts will cover us or provide favorable coverage. If one or more analysts downgrade our shares or change their opinion of our share price would likely decline. In addition, if one or more analysts cease coverage of us or fails to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our share price or trading volume to decline.\nBecause our directors and executive officers are among our largest stockholders, they can exert influence over our business and affairs and have actual or potential interests that may differ from other stockholders or investors.\nAs of the date of this report, our directors and executive officers collectively beneficially own approximately 13% of our issued and outstanding shares. John Hatsopoulos, a director, beneficially owns approximately 9% of our issued and outstanding shares. Additionally, the holdings of our directors and executive officers may increase in the future upon vesting or exercise of the options or other stock awards they may hold or in the future may be granted or if they otherwise acquire additional shares in the open market or otherwise. The interests of such persons may differ from the interests of our other stockholders. As a result, in addition to their board seats and offices, such persons will have influence over corporate actions requiring shareholder approval.\nSuch persons\u2019 stock ownership may discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to acquire us, which in turn could reduce our stock price or prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium over our stock price.\nCurrent stockholdings may be diluted if we make future equity issuances or if outstanding options are exercised for shares of our common stock.\n\u201cDilution\u201d refers to the reduction in the voting effect and proportionate ownership interest of a given number of shares of common stock as the total number of shares increases. Our issuance of additional stock, convertible preferred stock, or convertible debt may result in dilution to the interests of shareholders and may also result in the reduction of your stock price. The sale of a substantial number of shares into the market, or even the perception that sales could occur, could depress the price of our Common Stock. Also, the exercise of options may result in additional dilution.\nThe holders of outstanding options, warrants and convertible securities or derivatives, if any are subsequently issued have the opportunity to profit from a rise in the market price of our shares, if any, without assuming the risk of ownership, with a resulting dilution in the interests of other stockholders. We may find it more difficult to raise additional equity capital if it should be needed for our business while the options, warrants and convertible securities are outstanding.\nFuture sales of our shares by our existing stockholders may cause our stock price to fall.\nThe market price of our shares could decline as a result of sales by our existing stockholders of shares of our shares in the market or the perception that these sales could occur. These sales might also make it more difficult for us to conduct an equity or equity-based financing at a time and price that we deem appropriate and thus inhibit our ability to raise additional capital when it is needed.\nBecause we have not and do not intend to pay cash dividends, our stockholders receive no current income from holding our stock.\nWe have paid no cash dividends on our capital stock to date and we currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. We currently expect to retain earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business, and therefore do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. In addition, the terms of our credit facility may restrict our ability to pay any cash dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our Common Stock could be the sole source of gain for our stockholders for the foreseeable future.\nWe incur substantial costs to operate as a public reporting company.\nWe incur substantial legal, financial, accounting and other costs and expenses to operate as a public reporting company. We believe that these costs are a disproportionately larger percentage of our revenues than they are for many larger companies. In addition, the rules and regulations of the SEC impose significant requirements on public companies, including ongoing disclosure obligations and mandatory corporate governance practices. Our senior management and other personnel need to devote a substantial amount of time to ensure ongoing compliance with these requirements. Our common stock is currently quoted on the OTC Markets Group\u2019s OTCQX tier. Under the OTC Markets Group Inc.\u2019s OTCQX continued qualification requirements, we are required to have a minimum bid price of $0.10 per share as of the close of business for at least one of every 30 consecutive calendar days, a market capitalization of at least $5 million for at least one of every 30 consecutive calendar days, and at least two market makers. Also, we must be current in our SEC reporting obligations. If we determine to list our stock for trading on a national securities exchange or quoted on the Nasdaq Stock Market, we will be\nTECOGEN INC.\nsubject to additional disclosure and governance obligations. There can be no assurance that we will continue to meet all of the public company requirements to which we are subject on a timely basis, or at all, or that our compliance costs will not continue to be material.\nBecause our common stock is not traded on a national securities exchange, our stock has limited liquidity and our ability to raise capital is impaired.\nOn June 19, 2020, we voluntarily delisted our common stock from Nasdaq and transitioned the quotation of our shares to OTC Markets Group Inc.\u2019s OTCQX Best Market. Our common stock has been quoted on the OTC Markets Group Inc.\u2019s OTCQX Best Market since June 19, 2020, under the symbol \u201cTGEN\u201d. We believe that trading \u201cover the counter\u201d has limited our stock\u2019s liquidity and may impair our ability to raise additional capital.\nCertain provisions of our charter and bylaws may discourage mergers and other transactions.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may make it more difficult for someone to acquire control of us. These provisions may make it more difficult for stockholders to take certain corporate actions and could delay or prevent someone from acquiring our business. These provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock. The ability to issue \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock is a traditional anti-takeover measure. This provision may be beneficial to our management and the board of directors in a hostile tender offer and may have an adverse impact on stockholders who may want to participate in such tender offer, or who may want to replace some or all of the members of the board of directors.\nOur board of directors may issue additional shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock. Accordingly, our board of directors may, without shareholder approval, issue one or more new series of preferred stock with rights which could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of outstanding shares of our common stock. In addition, the issuance of shares of preferred stock may have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging, an acquisition or change of control of us. Although we do not have any current plans to issue any shares of preferred stock, we may do so in the future.\nIn order to comply with public reporting requirements, we must continue to strengthen our financial systems and internal controls, and failure to do so could adversely affect our ability to provide timely and accurate financial statements.\nRefinement of our internal controls and procedures will be required as we manage future growth and operate effectively as a public company. Such refinement of our internal controls, as well as compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related requirements, will be costly and will place a significant burden on management. We cannot assure you that measures already taken, or any future measures, will enable us to provide accurate and timely financial reports, particularly if we are unable to hire additional personnel in our accounting and financial department, or if we lose personnel in this area. Any failure to improve our disclosure controls or other problems with our financial systems or internal controls could result in delays or inaccuracies in reporting financial information, or non-compliance with SEC reporting and other regulatory requirements, any of which could adversely affect our business and stock price.\nInvestor confidence in the price of our stock may be adversely affected if we are unable to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. As of the end of the period covered by this report, our principal executive officers and principal accounting officer have concluded there is a material weakness in our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting, which could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the rules adopted by the SEC pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which require us to include in our annual report on Form 10-K our management\u2019s report on, and assessment of the effectiveness of, our internal control over financial reporting (\u201cmanagement\u2019s report\u201d). If we fail to achieve and maintain the adequacy of our disclosure control or internal control over financial reporting, there is a risk that we will not comply with all of the requirements imposed by Section 404. Moreover, effective internal control over financial reporting, particularly that relating to revenue recognition, is necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and is important in helping to prevent financial fraud. Any of these possible outcomes could result in an adverse reaction in the financial marketplace due to a loss in investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which ultimately could harm our business and could negatively impact the market price of our common stock. Investor confidence and the price of our common stock may be adversely affected if we are unable to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\nAs of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, December 31, 2020, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer performed an evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures and concluded that our controls were not effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file under the\nTECOGEN INC.\nSecurities Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported when required. Management conducted an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting and based on this evaluation, management concluded that the company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2020. We have a small number of employees dealing with general controls over information technology security and user access. This constitutes a material weakness in financial reporting. Any failure to implement effective internal controls could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Inadequate internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock and may require us to incur additional costs to improve our internal control system.\nGeneral Business Risks\nWe are implementing a new enterprise resource planning system and, if this new system proves ineffective or if we experience issues with the transition, we may be unable to timely or accurately prepare financial reports, make payments to our suppliers and employees, or invoice and collect from our users.\nWe are implementing a new enterprise resource planning, or ERP system. Our ERP system is critical to our ability to accurately maintain books and records and to prepare our financial statements. The transition to our new ERP system may be disruptive to our business if the ERP system does not work as planned or if we experience issues relating to the implementation. Such disruptions could impact our ability to timely or accurately make payments to our suppliers and employees, and could also inhibit our ability to invoice, and collect from our customers. Data integrity problems or other issues may be discovered which, if not corrected, could impact our business or financial results. In addition, we may experience periodic or prolonged disruption of our financial functions arising out of this conversion, general use of such system, other periodic upgrades or updates, or other external factors that are outside of our control. If we encounter unforeseen problems with our ERP system or other related systems and infrastructure, it could adversely affect our financial reporting systems and our ability to produce financial reports, the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting, and our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOur intellectual property may not be adequately protected.\nWe seek to protect our intellectual property rights through patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secret laws, confidentiality agreements, and licensing arrangements, but we cannot ensure that we will be able to adequately protect our technology from misappropriation or infringement. We cannot ensure that our existing intellectual property rights will not be invalidated, circumvented, challenged, or rendered unenforceable.\nOur competitors may successfully challenge the validity of our patents, design non-infringing products, or deliberately infringe our patents. There can be no assurance that other companies are not investigating or developing other similar technologies. In addition, our intellectual property rights may not provide a competitive advantage to us or ensure that our products and technology will be adequately covered by our patents and other intellectual property. Any of these factors or the expiration, termination, or invalidity of one or more of our patents may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOthers may assert that our technology infringes their intellectual property rights.\nWe may be subject to infringement claims from time to time. The defense of any claims of infringement made against us by third parties could involve significant legal costs and require our management to divert time from our business operations. If we are unsuccessful in defending any claims of infringement, we may be forced to obtain licenses or to pay additional royalties to continue to use our technology. We may not be able to obtain any necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we fail to obtain necessary licenses or other rights, or if these licenses are costly, our operating results would suffer either from reductions in revenues through our inability to serve customers or from increases in costs to license third-party technologies.\nOur business and financial performance may be adversely affected by information systems interruptions, cybersecurity attacks or other disruptions which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results from operations.\nWe depend upon information technology, infrastructure, including network, hardware and software systems to conduct our business. Despite our implementation of network and other cybersecurity measures, our information technology system and networks could be disrupted or experience a security breach from computer viruses, break-ins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems. Our security measures may not be adequate to protect against highly targeted sophisticated cyber-attacks, or other improper disclosures of confidential and/or sensitive information. Additionally, we may have access to confidential or other sensitive information of our customers, which despite our efforts to protect, may be vulnerable to security breaches, theft, or improper disclosure any of which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nTECOGEN INC.\nOur success is dependent upon attracting and retaining highly qualified personnel and the loss of key personnel could significantly hurt our business.\nTo achieve success, we must attract and retain highly qualified technical, operational and executive employees. The loss of the services of key employees or an inability to attract, train and retain qualified and skilled employees, specifically engineering, operations, and business development personnel, could result in the loss of business or could otherwise negatively impact our ability to operate and grow our business successfully.\nOur business may be impacted by political events, war, terrorism, public health issues, natural disasters and other circumstances that are not within our control.\nWar, terrorism, geopolitical uncertainties, public health issues, and other business interruptions have caused and could cause damage or disruption to international commerce and the global economy, and thus could have a material adverse effect on us, our suppliers, and manufacturing vendors. Our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents, terrorist attacks, and other hostile acts, labor disputes, public health issues, and other events beyond our control. Such events could decrease demand for our products, make it difficult or impossible for us to make and deliver products to our customers, or to receive products from our manufacturers and suppliers, and create delays and inefficiencies in our supply chain. If major public health issues, including pandemics, arise, we could be adversely affected by more stringent employee travel restrictions, additional limitations in freight services, governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions, delays in production ramps of new products, and disruptions in the operations of our manufacturing vendors and suppliers. In the event of a natural disaster, we could incur significant losses, require substantial recovery time and experience significant expenditures in order to resume operations.\nWe depend on a small number of customers for a substantial portion of our product revenues. The loss of one or more of these customers, or our inability to collect outstanding receivables from such customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, one customer accounted more than 10% of our revenues and during the year ended December 31, 2019, one customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenues. There was no customers who represented more than 10% of the accounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2020, and one as of December 31, 2019. The loss of any one or more of our major customers or our inability to collect on outstanding accounts receivable from one or more of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Our provision for doubtful accounts receivable increased $608,397 in the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. We continue to seek to increase our customer base and reduce our reliance on a limited number of customers. Although we are seeking to diversify our customer base and reduce our reliance upon sales to a small number of customers, we expect sales to such customers to continue to constitute a significant portion of our revenues in the near term given we actively pursue large contracts and projects. The loss of any one or more of such customers or an inability to collect such accounts receivable could have a material adverse effect our business, financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 14675, "SIC": 3621, "TIC": "TGEN"}
