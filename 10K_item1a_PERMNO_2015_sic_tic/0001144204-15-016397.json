{"cik": "1429260", "company": "CORONADO BIOSCIENCES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business operations face a number of risks. These risks should be read and considered with other information provided in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to our Growth Strategy\nIn-licensing, acquiring or investing in pharmaceutical and biotechnology products, technologies and/or companies may negatively impact our operating results.\nOur business strategy contemplates growth and product diversification. We continue to identify, evaluate and in-license, acquire and invest in pharmaceutical and biotechnology products, technologies and/or companies through our multiple subsidiaries. However, we cannot assure you that any such transaction will be successful or that we will realize the anticipated benefits of any such transaction.\nIn addition, we have not determined whether or how to consolidate the operations of any business we may acquire. As such, it may be difficult to consolidate the operations of businesses we may acquire with our existing operations or make other changes with respect to acquired businesses, which could in turn result in additional costs or other expenses. Our results of operations also may be adversely affected by expenses we incur in making acquisitions. For example, our results of operations may be impacted by expenses, including legal and accounting fees, incurred in connection with potential transactions, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets with definite lives, charges associated with the acquisition of incomplete technologies such as in-process research and development and by additional depreciation expense attributable to acquired assets. Any of the businesses or other assets we acquire may also have liabilities or adverse operating issues, including some that we fail to discover before completing the acquisition, and our indemnity for such liabilities may be limited.\nOur collaborative relationships with third parties could cause us to expend significant resources and incur substantial business risk with no assurance of financial return.\nWe anticipate substantial reliance upon strategic collaborations for marketing and the commercialization of our product candidates and we may rely even more on strategic collaborations for research and development (\u201cR&D\u201d) of our other product candidates. We may sell our product offerings through strategic partnerships with pharmaceutical companies. If we are unable to establish or manage such strategic collaborations on terms favorable to us in the future, our revenue and drug development may be limited.\nIf we determine to enter into R&D collaborations during the early phases of drug development, our success will in part depend on the performance of our research collaborators. We will not directly control the amount or timing of resources devoted by our research collaborators to activities related to our drug candidates. Our research collaborators may not commit sufficient resources to our programs. If any research collaborator fails to commit sufficient resources, our preclinical or clinical development programs related to this collaboration could be delayed or terminated. Also, our collaborators may pursue existing or other development-stage products or alternative technologies in preference to those being developed in collaboration with us. Finally, if we fail to make required milestone or royalty payments to our collaborators or to observe other obligations in our agreements with them, our collaborators may have the right to terminate those agreements.\nEstablishing strategic collaborations is difficult and time-consuming. Our discussion with potential collaborators may not lead to the establishment of collaborations on favorable terms, if at all. Potential collaborators may reject collaborations based upon their assessment of our financial, regulatory or intellectual property position. Even if we successfully establish new collaborations, these relationships may never result in the successful development or commercialization of our drug candidates or the generation of sales revenue. To the extent that we enter into collaborative arrangements, our drug revenues are likely to be lower than if we directly marketed and sold any drugs that we may develop.\nManagement of our relationships with our collaborators will require:\n\u00b7 significant time and effort from our management team;\n\u00b7 coordination of our marketing and R&D programs with the marketing and R&D priorities of our collaborators; and\n\u00b7 effective allocation of our resources to multiple projects.\nMany of our potential income generating investments are in companies that have limited commercialized revenue-generating products, which may negatively impact our investment returns.\nWe have made and will likely continue to make investments in companies that, at the time of investment, have limited or no commercialized revenue-generating products. The ultimate success of our investments in these companies will depend on the ability of such companies to innovate, develop and commercialize products in increasingly competitive and highly regulated markets. If the companies in which we invest do not successfully commercialize any products, the value of our investments will be negatively affected.\nWe may not be able to manage our anticipated growth, which may in turn adversely impact our business.\nWe will need to continue to expend funds on improving our infrastructure to address our anticipated growth. Acquisitions, even through our multiple subsidiaries, could place a strain on management, and administrative, operational and financial systems. In addition, we may need to hire, train and manage more employees, focusing on their integration with our Company and corporate culture. Integration and management issues associated with increased acquisitions may require a disproportionate amount of our management\u2019s time and attention and distract our management from running our business.\nAs we continue to execute our growth strategy, we may be subject to further government regulation which would adversely affect our operations.\nIf we engage in business combinations and other transactions that result in our Company holding passive investment interests in a number of entities, we may become subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \u201cInvestment Company Act\u201d). If we do become subject to the Investment Company Act, we would be required to register as an investment company and could be expected to incur significant registration and compliance costs in the future.\nWe may not be able to hire or retain key officers or employees that we need to implement our business strategy and develop our products and businesses.\nOur success depends significantly on the continued contributions of our executive officers, scientific and technical personnel and consultants, and on our ability to attract additional personnel as we seek to implement our growth strategy and develop our existing products. During our operating history, we have assigned many essential responsibilities to a relatively small number of individuals. However, as we implement our growth strategy and the demands on our key employees expand, we will continue to be required to recruit additional qualified employees. The competition for such qualified personnel is intense, and the loss of services of certain key personnel or our inability to attract additional personnel to fill critical positions could adversely affect our business.\nWe currently depend heavily upon the efforts and abilities of our management team. The loss or unavailability of the services of any of these individuals for any significant period of time could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results. In addition, we have not obtained, do not own, nor are we the beneficiary of key-person life insurance for all of our key personnel. We only maintain a limited amount of directors and officers liability insurance coverage to protect all of our directors and executive officers taken together. There can be no assurance that this coverage will be sufficient to cover the costs of the events that may lead to its invocation, in which case, there could be a substantial impact on our ability to continue operations, should such an unforeseen event occur.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe are an early-stage company, with limited operating history upon which stockholders can base an investment decision.\nWe remain an early-stage biopharmaceutical company. To date, we have engaged primarily in R&D activities and have not generated any revenues from product sales. We have incurred significant net losses since our inception. As of December 31, 2014, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $141.7 million. We have not demonstrated our ability to perform the functions necessary for the successful commercialization of any of our products. The successful commercialization of any of our current products will require us to perform a variety of functions, including:\n\u2022 continuing to undertake pre-clinical development and clinical trials;\n\u2022 participating in regulatory approval processes;\n\u2022 formulating and manufacturing products; and\n\u2022 conducting sales and marketing activities.\nOur operations have been limited to organizing and staffing our Company, acquiring, developing and securing the proprietary rights for, and undertaking pre-clinical development and clinical trials of our product candidates, and, most recently, to executing our growth strategy. These operations provide a limited basis for our stockholders and prospective investors to assess our ability to commercialize our current product candidates, develop potential product candidates and the advisability of investing in our securities.\nOur existing product candidates are at an early stage of development and may not be successfully developed or commercialized.\nOur existing product candidates, TSO and CNDO-109, are in the early stage of development and will require substantial further capital expenditures, development, testing and regulatory clearances prior to commercialization. The development and regulatory approval process takes several years and it is not likely that either TSO or CNDO-109, even if successfully developed and approved by the FDA, would be commercially available for five or more years. Of the large number of drugs in development, only a small percentage successfully completes the FDA regulatory approval process and is commercialized. Accordingly, even if we are able to obtain the requisite financing to fund our development programs, we cannot assure you that our product candidates will be successfully developed or commercialized.\nOn October 14, 2013, we announced that our TRUST-I study did not meet its primary endpoint of improving response, defined as a 100-point decrease in the CDAI, nor the key secondary endpoint of remission, defined as achieving CDAI \u2264 150 points. In the overall patient population, response rate of patients on TSO did not separate from that of placebo. The randomization was stratified by disease activity as measured by CDAI. In the corresponding pre-defined subset analysis, TSO showed a non-significant improved response in patients with CDAI>290. The lack of overall response was driven by higher-than-expected placebo response rate in patients with CDAI<290. While we are continuing to analyze the trial data, the results of this trial negatively impact the potential for successful development of TSO.\nIn November 2013, Falk informed us that an IDMC had conducted a second interim analysis of data from approximately 240 patients who had completed 12 weeks of treatment in Falk\u2019s Phase 2 clinical trial in Europe evaluating TSO in CD. The committee recommended that the trial be stopped due to lack of efficacy and noted no safety concerns. Falk adopted the committee\u2019s recommendations and discontinued the study. The Falk trial, also known as the TRUST-II study, is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-center Phase 2 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of three different dosages of oral TSO in patients with active CD.\nIn December 2013, we met with the FDA in a \u201cType B\u201d pre-IND teleconference concerning the clinical and regulatory program for advancing TSO through the clinical trial process and used the feedback from this meeting in the design and implementation of the Phase 2 ASD study. We then launched a Phase 2 study of TSO in ASD patents with immune dysregulation (the \u201cPhase 2 ASD Study\u201d) in May 2014. We have not yet determined the development path, if any, for TSO and cannot give any assurances as to the outcome of the Phase 2 ASD study, the future development of TSO, the indications for which TSO could be a treatment, or the costs and timelines for any development plans. Our failure to develop, manufacture or receive regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize any of our product candidates could result in the failure of our business and a loss of your investment in our Company.\nBecause we in-licensed our existing product candidates from third parties, any dispute with our licensors or non-performance by us or by our licensors may adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize the applicable product candidates.\nAll of our existing product candidates, including related intellectual property rights, were in-licensed from third parties. Under the terms of our license agreements, the licensors generally have the right to terminate such agreements in the event of a material breach by us. Our licenses require us to make annual, milestone or other payments prior to commercialization of any product and our ability to make these payments depends on our ability to generate cash in the future. These agreements generally require us to use diligent and reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize the product candidate. In the case of TSO, Ovamed licenses TSO from a third party, UIRF, in exchange for annual and milestone payments, patent cost reimbursement, royalties based on sales and diligence obligations. Our rights to TSO are, therefore, also subject to Ovamed\u2019s performance of its obligations to UIRF, any breach of which we may be required to remedy in order to preserve our rights. As of December 31, 2014, we owed approximately $250,000 pursuant to such license. If such amounts are not paid, UIRF may declare a breach of the license agreement, which would adversely affect our ability to commercialize TSO.\nIf there is any conflict, dispute, disagreement or issue of non-performance between us and our licensing partner regarding our rights or obligations under the license agreement, including any conflict, dispute or disagreement arising from our failure to satisfy payment obligations under such agreement, our ability to develop and commercialize the affected product candidate may be adversely affected. Similarly, any such dispute or issue of non-performance between Ovamed and UIRF that we are unable to cure could adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize TSO. Any loss of our rights under our license agreements could delay or completely terminate our product development efforts for the affected product candidate. On February 27, 2015, Ovamed, our only supplier and manufacturer of TSO, filed for insolvency in Germany, a process similar to U.S. bankruptcy. At this time, we are unable to assess the likelihood of Ovamed continuing operations or being able to supply TSO.\nBecause the results of preclinical studies and early clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of future results, any product candidate we advance into clinical trials may not have favorable results in later clinical trials, if any, or receive regulatory approval.\nPharmaceutical development has inherent risk. We will be required to demonstrate through well-controlled clinical trials that our existing product candidates are effective with a favorable benefit-risk profile for use in their target indications before we can seek regulatory approvals for their commercial sale. Success in early clinical trials does not mean that later clinical trials will be successful as product candidates in later-stage clinical trials may fail to demonstrate sufficient safety or efficacy despite having progressed through initial clinical testing. We also may need to conduct additional clinical trials that are not currently anticipated. Companies frequently suffer significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after earlier clinical trials have shown promising results. In addition, only a small percentage of drugs under development result in the submission of an NDA or BLA to the FDA and even fewer are approved for commercialization.\nAny product candidates we advance into clinical development are subject to extensive regulation, which can be costly and time consuming, cause unanticipated delays or prevent the receipt of the required approvals to commercialize our product candidates.\nThe clinical development, manufacturing, labeling, storage, record-keeping, advertising, promotion, import, export, marketing and distribution of our product candidates, TSO and CNDO-109, are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA in the United States and by comparable health authorities in foreign markets. In the United States, we are not permitted to market our product candidates until we receive approval of a BLA from the FDA. The process of obtaining BLA approval is expensive, often takes many years and can vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the products involved. Our development of CNDO-109, which is an individualized immunotherapy, may in particular be affected because to date the FDA has only approved one individualized immunotherapy treatment. In addition to the significant clinical testing requirements, our ability to obtain marketing approval for these products depends on obtaining the final results of required non-clinical testing, including characterization of the manufactured components of our product candidates and validation of our manufacturing processes. The FDA may determine that our product manufacturing processes, testing procedures or facilities are insufficient to justify approval. Approval policies or regulations may change and the FDA has substantial discretion in the pharmaceutical approval process, including the ability to delay, limit or deny approval of a product candidate for many reasons. Despite the time and expense invested in clinical development of product candidates, regulatory approval is never guaranteed.\nThe FDA and other regulatory agencies can delay, limit or deny approval of a product candidate for many reasons, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022 the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with the design or implementation of our clinical trials;\n\u2022 we may be unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA that a product candidate is safe and effective for any indication;\n\u2022 the FDA may not accept clinical data from trials which are conducted by individual investigators or in countries where the standard of care is potentially different from that of the United States;\n\u2022 the results of clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the FDA for approval;\n\u2022 the FDA may disagree with our interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u2022 the FDA may fail to approve our manufacturing processes or facilities or those of third-party manufacturers with which we or our collaborators contract for clinical and commercial supplies; or\n\u2022 the approval policies or regulations of the FDA may significantly change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval.\nWith respect to foreign markets, approval procedures vary among countries and, in addition to the aforementioned risks, can involve additional product testing, administrative review periods and agreements with pricing authorities. In addition, recent events raising questions about the safety of certain marketed pharmaceuticals may result in increased cautiousness by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities in reviewing new pharmaceuticals based on safety, efficacy or other regulatory considerations and may result in significant delays in obtaining regulatory approvals. Any delay in obtaining, or inability to obtain, applicable regulatory approvals would prevent us from commercializing our product candidates.\nAny product candidate we advance into clinical trials may cause unacceptable adverse events or have other properties that may delay or prevent their regulatory approval or commercialization or limit their commercial potential.\nUnacceptable adverse events caused by any of our product candidates that we advance into clinical trials could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in the denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other regulatory authorities for any or all targeted indications and markets. This, in turn, could prevent us from commercializing the affected product candidate and generating revenues from its sale. For example, in Phase 1/2 oncology trials, dose limiting toxicity, or DLT, stopping rules are commonly applied. Our CNDO-109 Phase 1/2 trial is subject to a set of DLTs that could suspend or stop dose escalation by predetermined criteria, including allergic reactions, prolonged aplasia or other organ toxicities of a serious nature.\nWe have not yet completed testing of any of our product candidates for the treatment of the indications for which we intend to seek product approval in humans, and we currently do not know the extent of adverse events, if any, that will be observed in patients who receive any of our product candidates. If any of our product candidates cause unacceptable adverse events in clinical trials, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval or commercialize such product or, if such product candidate is approved for marketing, future adverse events could cause us to withdraw such product from the market.\nDelays in the commencement of our clinical trials could result in increased costs and delay our ability to pursue regulatory approval.\nThe commencement of clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons, including delays in:\n\u2022 obtaining regulatory clearance to commence a clinical trial;\n\u2022 identifying, recruiting and training suitable clinical investigators;\n\u2022 reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective clinical research organizations, or CROs, and trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation, may be subject to modification from time to time and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;\n\u2022 obtaining sufficient quantities of a product candidate for use in clinical trials;\n\u2022 obtaining IRB or ethics committee approval to conduct a clinical trial at a prospective site;\n\u2022 identifying, recruiting and enrolling patients to participate in a clinical trial; and\n\u2022 retaining patients who have initiated a clinical trial but may withdraw due to adverse events from the therapy, insufficient efficacy, fatigue with the clinical trial process or personal issues. Any delays in the commencement of our clinical trials will delay our ability to pursue regulatory approval for our product candidates. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of a product candidate.\nSuspensions or delays in the completion of clinical testing could result in increased costs to us and delay or prevent our ability to complete development of that product or generate product revenues.\nOnce a clinical trial has begun, patient recruitment and enrollment may be slower than we anticipate. Clinical trials may also be delayed as a result of ambiguous or negative interim results or difficulties in obtaining sufficient quantities of product manufactured in accordance with regulatory requirements and on a timely basis. Further, a clinical trial may be modified, suspended or terminated by us, an IRB, an ethics committee or a data safety monitoring committee overseeing the clinical trial, any clinical trial site with respect to that site, or the FDA or other regulatory authorities due to a number of factors, including:\n\u2022 failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols;\n\u2022 inspection of the clinical trial operations or clinical trial site by the FDA or other regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold;\n\u2022 stopping rules contained in the protocol;\n\u2022 unforeseen safety issues or any determination that the clinical trial presents unacceptable health risks; and\n\u2022 lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial.\nChanges in regulatory requirements and guidance also may occur and we may need to amend clinical trial protocols to reflect these changes. Amendments may require us to resubmit our clinical trial protocols to IRBs for re-examination, which may impact the costs, timing and the likelihood of a successful completion of a clinical trial. If we experience delays in the completion of, or if we must suspend or terminate, any clinical trial of any product candidate, our ability to obtain regulatory approval for that product candidate will be delayed and the commercial prospects, if any, for the product candidate may suffer as a result. In addition, many of these factors may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of a product candidate.\nEven if approved, TSO, CNDO-109 or any other product candidates that we may develop and market may be later withdrawn from the market or subject to promotional limitations.\nWe may not be able to obtain the labeling claims necessary or desirable for the promotion of our product candidates if approved. We may also be required to undertake post-marketing clinical trials. If the results of such post-marketing studies are not satisfactory or if adverse events or other safety issues arise after approval, the FDA or a comparable regulatory agency in another country may withdraw marketing authorization or may condition continued marketing on commitments from us that may be expensive and/or time consuming to complete. In addition, if we or others identify adverse side effects after any of our products are on the market, or if manufacturing problems occur, regulatory approval may be withdrawn and reformulation of our products, additional clinical trials, changes in labeling of our products and additional marketing applications may be required. Any reformulation or labeling changes may limit the marketability of our products if approved.\nWe have abandoned our plans to produce clinical supplies and commercial supplies of TSO in the Woburn facility and our dependence on third-party suppliers for TSO could adversely impact our business.\nBased upon TRUST-I results in October 2013, we abandoned our plans to manufacture TSO and discontinued the buildout of our U.S. manufacturing facility in Woburn, MA. As such, we continue to rely exclusively on Ovamed to supply us with our requirements of TSO. On February 27, 2015, Ovamed filed for insolvency in Germany, a process similar to U.S. bankruptcy. As a result, we are unable to assess the likelihood of Ovamed continuing operations or supplying TSO. If Ovamed becomes unable or unwilling to deliver sufficient quantities of TSO to us on a timely basis and in accordance with applicable specifications and other regulatory requirements, there would be a significant interruption of our TSO supply, which may adversely affect clinical development and potential commercialization of the product. In the event that the FDA or other agencies determine that Ovamed or our third-party suppliers have not complied with cGMP, our clinical trials could be terminated or subjected to a clinical hold until such time as we are able to obtain appropriate replacement material. Furthermore, if Ovamed or any other contract manufacturer who supply Ovamed cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and with FDA regulatory requirements, we will not be able to secure and/or maintain FDA approval for TSO. Ovamed and our third-party suppliers are and will be required to maintain compliance with cGMPs and will be subject to inspections by the FDA and comparable agencies in other jurisdictions to confirm such compliance. Any delay, interruption or other issues that arise in the manufacture, packaging, or storage of our products as a result of a failure of Ovamed\u2019s facilities or operations or of our third-party suppliers to pass any regulatory agency inspection could significantly impair our ability to develop and commercialize our products.\nWe do and will also rely on our manufacturers to purchase from third-party suppliers the materials necessary to produce our product candidates for our anticipated clinical trials. There are a small number of suppliers for certain capital equipment and raw materials that are used to manufacture TSO. We will and Ovamed does rely on a single source of ova. We do not have any control over the process or timing of the acquisition of raw materials by our manufacturers. Moreover, we currently do not have any agreements for the commercial production of these raw materials. Any significant delay in the supply of a product candidate or the raw material components thereof for an ongoing clinical trial could considerably delay completion of our clinical trials, product testing and potential regulatory approval of our product candidates.\nWe or Ovamed may not have the resources or capacity to commercially manufacture TSO, if approved, and will likely continue to be dependent upon third-party manufacturers. Our inability or our dependence on third parties to manufacture and supply us with clinical trial materials and any approved products may adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize TSO on a timely basis or at all.\nWe currently rely completely on WuXi, PCT and BioReliance to manufacture our preclinical and clinical pharmaceutical supplies of CNDO-109 and expect to continue to rely on them and other contractors to produce commercial supplies of CNDO-109, and our dependence on third-party suppliers could adversely impact our business.\nWe are completely dependent on third party manufacturers for product supply of CNDO-109. We rely on WuXi, PCT and BioReliance for our CNDO-109 requirements and our CNDO-109 clinical program would be adversely affected by a significant interruption in the supply of this product. Furthermore, if WuXi, PCT and BioReliance or any other contract manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and with FDA regulatory requirements, we will not be able to secure and/or maintain FDA approval for CNDO-109. Our third-party suppliers will be required to maintain compliance with cGMPs and will be subject to inspections by the FDA and comparable agencies in other jurisdictions to confirm such compliance. In the event that the FDA or such other agencies determine that our third-party suppliers have not complied with cGMP, our clinical trials could be terminated or subjected to a clinical hold until such time as we are able to obtain appropriate replacement material. Any delay, interruption or other issues that arise in the manufacture, packaging, or storage of our products as a result of a failure of the facilities or operations of our third-party suppliers to pass any regulatory agency inspection could significantly impair our ability to develop and commercialize our products.\nWe will also rely on our manufacturers to purchase from third-party suppliers the materials necessary to produce our product candidates for our anticipated clinical trials. There are a small number of suppliers for certain capital equipment and raw materials that are used to manufacture CNDO-109. We do not have any control over the process or timing of the acquisition of these raw materials by our manufacturers. Moreover, we currently do not have any agreements for the commercial production of these raw materials. Any significant delay in the supply of CNDO-109 or the raw material components thereof for an ongoing clinical trial could considerably delay completion of our clinical trials, product testing and potential regulatory approval of CNDO-109.\nWe do not expect to have the resources or capacity to commercially manufacture CNDO-109, if approved, and will likely continue to be dependent upon third-party manufacturers. Our dependence on third parties to manufacture and supply us with clinical trial materials and any approved products may adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize CNDO-109 on a timely basis or at all.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials. If these third parties do not meet our deadlines or otherwise conduct the trials as required, our clinical development programs could be delayed or unsuccessful and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates when expected or at all.\nWe do not have the ability to conduct all aspects of our preclinical testing or clinical trials ourselves. We intend and do use CROs to conduct our planned clinical trials and will and do rely upon such CROs, as well as medical institutions, clinical investigators and consultants, to conduct our trials in accordance with our clinical protocols. Our CROs, investigators and other third parties will and do play a significant role in the conduct of these trials and the subsequent collection and analysis of data from the clinical trials.\nThere is no guarantee that any CROs, investigators and other third parties upon which we rely for administration and conduct of our clinical trials will devote adequate time and resources to such trials or perform as contractually required. If any of these third parties fail to meet expected deadlines, fail to adhere to our clinical protocols or otherwise perform in a substandard manner, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated. If any of our clinical trial sites terminate for any reason, we may experience the loss of follow-up information on patients enrolled in our ongoing clinical trials unless we are able to transfer the care of those patients to another qualified clinical trial site. In addition, principal investigators for our clinical trials may serve as scientific advisers or consultants to us from time to time and receive cash or equity compensation in connection with such services. If these relationships and any related compensation result in perceived or actual conflicts of interest, the integrity of the data generated at the applicable clinical trial site may be jeopardized.\nIf our competitors develop treatments for the target indications of our product candidates that are approved more quickly, marketed more successfully or demonstrated to be more effective than our product candidates, our commercial opportunity will be reduced or eliminated.\nWe operate in highly competitive segments of the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical markets. We face competition from many different sources, including commercial pharmaceutical and biotechnology enterprises, academic institutions, government agencies, and private and public research institutions. Our product candidates, if successfully developed and approved, will compete with established therapies, as well as new treatments that may be introduced by our competitors. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, product development, manufacturing and marketing resources than us. Large pharmaceutical companies have extensive experience in clinical testing and obtaining regulatory approval for drugs. In addition, many universities and private and public research institutes are active in cancer research, some in direct competition with us. We also may compete with these organizations to recruit management, scientists and clinical development personnel. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. New developments, including the development of other biological and pharmaceutical technologies and methods of treating disease, occur in the pharmaceutical and life sciences industries at a rapid pace. Developments by competitors may render our product candidates obsolete or noncompetitive. We will also face competition from these third parties in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials and in identifying and in-licensing new product candidates.\nIf we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or fail to enter into agreements with third parties to market, distribute and sell any products we may successfully develop, we may not be able to effectively market and sell any such products and generate product revenue.\nWe do not currently have the infrastructure for the sales, marketing and distribution of any of our product candidates, and must build this infrastructure or make arrangements with third parties to perform these functions in order to commercialize any products that we may successfully develop. The establishment and development of a sales force, either by us or jointly with a partner, or the establishment of a contract sales force to market any products we may develop will be expensive and time-consuming and could delay any product launch. If we, or our partners, are unable to establish sales and marketing capability or any other non-technical capabilities necessary to commercialize any products we may successfully develop, we will need to contract with third parties to market and sell such products. We may not be able to establish arrangements with third parties on acceptable terms, or at all.\nIf any product candidate that we successfully develop does not achieve broad market acceptance among physicians, patients, healthcare payors and the medical community, the revenues that it generates from their sales will be limited.\nEven if our product candidates receive regulatory approval, they may not gain market acceptance among physicians, patients, healthcare payors and the medical community. Coverage and reimbursement of our product candidates by third-party payors, including government payors, generally is also necessary for commercial success. The degree of market acceptance of any approved products will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022 the efficacy and safety as demonstrated in clinical trials;\n\u2022 the clinical indications for which the product is approved;\n\u2022 acceptance by physicians, major operators of hospitals and clinics and patients of the product as a safe and effective treatment;\n\u2022 acceptance of the product by the target population;\n\u2022 the potential and perceived advantages of product candidates over alternative treatments;\n\u2022 the safety of product candidates seen in a broader patient group, including its use outside the approved indications;\n\u2022 the cost of treatment in relation to alternative treatments;\n\u2022 the availability of adequate reimbursement and pricing by third parties and government authorities;\n\u2022 relative convenience and ease of administration;\n\u2022 the prevalence and severity of adverse events;\n\u2022 the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts; and\n\u2022 unfavorable publicity relating to the product.\nIf any product candidate is approved but does not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, hospitals, healthcare payors and patients, we may not generate sufficient revenue from these products and may not become or remain profitable.\nWe may incur substantial product liability or indemnification claims relating to the clinical testing of our product candidates.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of our product candidates in human clinical trials, and claims could be brought against us if use or misuse of one of our product candidates causes, or merely appears to have caused, personal injury or death. While we have and intend to maintain product liability insurance relating to our clinical trials, our coverage may not be sufficient to cover claims that may be made against us and we may be unable to maintain such insurance. Any claims against us, regardless of their merit, could severely harm our financial condition, strain our management and other resources or destroy the prospects for commercialization of the product which is the subject of any such claim. We are unable to predict if we will be able to obtain or maintain product liability insurance for any products that may be approved for marketing. Additionally, we have entered into various agreements where we indemnify third parties for certain claims relating to our product candidates. These indemnification obligations may require us to pay significant sums of money for claims that are covered by these indemnifications.\nHealthcare reform and restrictions on reimbursements may limit our financial returns.\nOur ability or the ability of our collaborators to commercialize any of our product candidates that we successfully develop may depend, in part, on the extent to which government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations will reimburse consumers for the cost of these products. These third parties are increasingly challenging both the need for and the price of new drug products. Significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved therapeutics. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available for our product candidates to enable us or our collaborators to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on their and our investments in research and product development.\nWe use biological materials and may use hazardous materials, and any claims relating to improper handling, storage or disposal of these materials could be time consuming and costly.\nWe may use hazardous materials, including chemicals and biological agents and compounds that could be dangerous to human health and safety or the environment. Our operations also produce hazardous waste products. Federal, state and local laws and regulations govern the use, generation, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and wastes. Compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations may be expensive, and current or future environmental laws and regulations may impair our product development efforts. In addition, we cannot entirely eliminate the risk of accidental injury or contamination from these materials or wastes. We do not carry specific biological or hazardous waste insurance coverage and our property and casualty and general liability insurance policies specifically exclude coverage for damages and fines arising from biological or hazardous waste exposure or contamination. Accordingly, in the event of contamination or injury, we could be held liable for damages or penalized with fines in an amount exceeding our resources, and our clinical trials or regulatory approvals could be suspended.\nAlthough we maintain workers\u2019 compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. We do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us in connection with our storage or disposal of biological or hazardous materials.\nIn addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These current or future laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations may be subject to risks arising from the international scope of our product development.\nTSO is manufactured outside the United States and, in light of our growth strategy, we may continue to do business in or acquire products from new countries, including emerging markets. As a result, we may be subject to risks inherent in conducting business abroad, including, among other things:\n\u00b7 difficulties in coordinating and managing foreign activities, including ensuring that foreign activities comply with foreign laws as well as U.S. laws applicable to U.S. companies with foreign operations, such as export laws and the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA;\n\u00b7 price and currency exchange controls;\n\u00b7 credit market uncertainty;\n\u00b7 political and economic instability;\n\u00b7 compliance with multiple regulatory regimes;\n\u00b7 less established legal and regulatory regimes in certain jurisdictions, including as relates to enforcement of anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws and the reliability of the judicial systems;\n\u00b7 differing degrees of protection for intellectual property;\n\u00b7 unexpected changes in foreign regulatory requirements, including quality standards and other certification requirements;\n\u00b7 new export license requirements;\n\u00b7 adverse changes in tariff and trade protection measures;\n\u00b7 differing labor regulations;\n\u00b7 restrictive governmental actions;\n\u00b7 difficulties with licensees, contract counterparties, or other commercial partners; and\n\u00b7 differing local product preferences and product requirements.\nAny of these factors, or any other international factors, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.\nOur success will depend upon intellectual property, proprietary technologies and regulatory market exclusivity periods, and the intellectual property protection for our product candidates depends significantly on third parties.\nOur success will depend, in large part, on obtaining and maintaining patent protection and trade secret protection for our product candidates and their formulations and uses, as well as successfully defending these patents against third-party challenges. UIRF, Falk and Ovamed are responsible for prosecuting and maintaining patent protection relating to their respective patents relating to TSO, and UCLB is responsible for prosecuting and maintaining patent protection for CNDO-109, in each case at our expense for our territories. If UIRF, Falk, Ovamed and/or UCLB fail to appropriately prosecute and maintain patent protection for these product candidates, our ability to develop and commercialize these product candidates may be adversely affected and we may not be able to prevent competitors from making, using and selling competing products. This failure to properly protect the intellectual property rights relating to these product candidates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe patent application process is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, and there can be no assurance that we or our partners will be successful in protecting our product candidates by obtaining and defending patents. These risks and uncertainties include the following:\n\u2022 patent applications may not result in any patents being issued;\n\u2022 patents that may be issued or in-licensed may be challenged, invalidated, modified, revoked, circumvented, found to be unenforceable, or otherwise may not provide any competitive advantage;\n\u2022 our competitors, many of which have substantially greater resources than we or our partners and many of which have made significant investments in competing technologies, may seek, or may already have obtained, patents that may limit or interfere with our ability to make, use, and sell our potential products;\n\u2022 there may be significant pressure on the U.S. government and other international governmental bodies to limit the scope of patent protection both inside and outside the United States for disease treatments that prove successful as a matter of public policy regarding worldwide health concerns; and\n\u2022 countries other than the United States may have patent laws less favorable to patentees than those upheld by U.S. courts, allowing foreign competitors a better opportunity to create, develop, and market competing products.\nIn addition to patents, we and our partners also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how. Although we have taken steps to protect our trade secrets and unpatented know-how, including entering into confidentiality agreements with third parties, and confidential information and inventions agreements with employees, consultants and advisers, third parties may still obtain this information or come upon this same or similar information independently.\nWe also intend to rely on our ability to obtain and maintain a regulatory period of market exclusivity for any of our biologic product candidates that are successfully developed and approved for commercialization. Although this period in the United States is currently 12 years from the date of marketing approval, there is a risk that the U.S. Congress could amend laws to significantly shorten this exclusivity period, as proposed by President Obama. Once any regulatory period of exclusivity expires, depending on the status of our patent coverage and the nature of the product, we may not be able to prevent others from marketing products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with our products, which would materially adversely affect us.\nIn addition, U.S. patent laws may change, which could prevent or limit us from filing patent applications or patent claims to protect our products and/or technologies or limit the exclusivity periods that are available to patent holders. For example, on September 16, 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, was signed into law, and includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. These include changes to transition from a \u201cfirst-to-invent\u201d system to a \u201cfirst-to-file\u201d system and to the way issued patents are challenged. These changes may favor larger and more established companies that have more resources to devote to patent application filing and prosecution. The PTO implemented the America Invents Act on March 16, 2013, and it remains to be seen how the judicial system and the PTO will interpret and enforce these new laws. Accordingly, it is not clear what impact, if any, the Leahy-Smith Act will ultimately have on the cost of prosecuting our patent applications, our ability to obtain patents based on our discoveries and our ability to enforce or defend our issued patents.\nIf we or our partners are sued for infringing intellectual property rights of third parties, it will be costly and time consuming, and an unfavorable outcome in that litigation would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur success also depends on our ability and the ability of any of our future collaborators to develop, manufacture, market and sell our product candidates without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields in which we are developing products, some of which may be directed at claims that overlap with the subject matter of our intellectual property. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending applications, unknown to us, which may later result in issued patents that our product candidates or proprietary technologies may infringe. Similarly, there may be issued patents relevant to our product candidates of which we are not aware.\nThere is a substantial amount of litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries generally. If a third party claims that we or any of our licensors, suppliers or collaborators infringe the third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, we may have to:\n\u2022 obtain licenses, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all;\n\u2022 abandon an infringing product candidate or redesign our products or processes to avoid infringement;\n\u2022 pay substantial damages, including the possibility of treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees, if a court decides that the product or proprietary technology at issue infringes on or violates the third party\u2019s rights;\n\u2022 pay substantial royalties, fees and/or grant cross-licenses to our technology; and/or\n\u2022 defend litigation or administrative proceedings which may be costly whether we win or lose, and which could result in a substantial diversion of our financial and management resources.\nWe may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or the patents of our licensors, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents or the patents of our licensors. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time consuming. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated, found to be unenforceable, or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation.\nWe may be subject to claims that our consultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their other clients or former employers to us.\nAs is common in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry, we engage the services of consultants to assist us in the development of our product candidates. Many of these consultants were previously employed at, or may have previously been or are currently providing consulting services to, other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. We may become subject to claims that we or these consultants have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers or their former or current customers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nAny product for which we obtain marketing approval could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we experience unanticipated problems with our products, when and if any of them are approved.\nAny product for which we obtain marketing approval, along with the manufacturing processes and facilities, post-approval clinical data, labeling, advertising and promotional activities for such product, will be subject to continual requirements of and review by the FDA and comparable regulatory authorities. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration requirements, cGMP requirements relating to quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, requirements regarding the distribution of samples to physicians and recordkeeping. Even if we obtain regulatory approval of a product, the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, or contain requirements for costly post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product. We also may be subject to state laws and registration requirements covering the distribution of our products. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with our products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in actions such as:\n\u00b7 restrictions on such products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes;\n\u00b7 warning letters;\n\u00b7 withdrawal of the products from the market;\n\u00b7 refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit;\n\u00b7 voluntary or mandatory recall;\n\u00b7 fines;\n\u00b7 suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals or refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit;\n\u00b7 refusal to permit the import or export of our products;\n\u00b7 product seizure or detentions;\n\u00b7 injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties; and\n\u00b7 adverse publicity.\nIf we, or our suppliers, third-party contractors, clinical investigators or collaborators are slow to adapt, or are unable to adapt, to changes in existing regulatory requirements or adoption of new regulatory requirements or policies, we or our collaborators may lose marketing approval for our products when and if any of them are approved, resulting in decreased revenue from milestones, product sales or royalties.\nRisks Relating to our Finances, Capital Requirements and Other Financial Matters\nWe are an early -stage company with a history of operating losses that is expected to continue and we are unable to predict the extent of future losses, whether we will generate significant or any revenues or whether we will achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe are an early-stage company and our prospects must be considered in light of the uncertainties, risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stages of operations. We continue to generate operating losses in all periods including losses of approximately $27.6 million, $37.2 million and $20.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively. At December 31, 2014, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $141.7 million. We expect to make substantial expenditures and incur increasing operating costs and interest expense in the future and our accumulated deficit will increase significantly as we expand development and clinical trial activities for our product candidates and realize our growth strategy. Our losses have had, and are expected to continue to have, an adverse impact on our working capital, total assets and stockholders\u2019 equity. Because of the risks and uncertainties associated with product development and growth strategy, we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses, whether we will ever generate significant or any revenues or if we will ever achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe repaid our existing $15.0 million term loan agreement with Hercules in February 2014 and replaced it with a promissory note in favor of Israel Discount Bank of New York (\u201cIDB\u201d). At December 31, 2014, the amount of debt outstanding under the promissory note in favor of IDB was $14.0 million. The loan is collateralized by a security interest, a general lien upon, and right of set off against our money market account of $15.0 million. If we default on our obligations, IDB may declare the loan immediately payable together with accrued interest and exercise its right to set-off. If an event of default occurs, we may not be able to cure it within any applicable cure period, if at all. If the maturity of our indebtedness is accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds available for repayment or we may not have the ability to borrow or obtain sufficient funds to replace the accelerated indebtedness on terms acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, the promissory note with IDB may limit our ability to finance future operations or satisfy capital needs or to engage in, expand or pursue our business activities. It may also prevent us from engaging in activities that could be beneficial to our business and our stockholders unless we repay the outstanding debt, which may not be desirable or possible.\nWe may need substantial additional funding and may be unable to raise capital when needed, which may force us to delay, curtail or eliminate one or more of our R&D programs and commercialization efforts and potentially change our growth strategy.\nOur operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since inception. During the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014 we incurred R&D expenses of approximately $17.5 million, $25.7 million and $10.2 million, respectively. Since our inception in 2006, we incurred R&D expenses of approximately $77.9 million. We expect to continue to spend significant amounts on product development, including conducting clinical trials for our current product candidates as well as potentially new product candidates, and on our growth strategy. We believe that our cash as of December 31, 2014, will enable us to continue to fund operations in the normal course of business for at least the next 12 months. In addition, in February 2015, we raised $10 million in a private offering of a promissory note to NSC BIOTECH VENTURE FUND I LLC. However, until such time, if ever, as we can generate a sufficient amount of product revenue and achieve profitability, we expect to seek to finance potential, longer-term cash needs. Our ability to obtain additional funding when needed, changes to our operating plans, our existing and anticipated working capital needs, the acceleration or modification of our planned R&D activities, expenditures and growth strategy, increased expenses or other events may affect our need for additional capital in the future and require us to seek additional funding sooner than anticipated. In addition, if we are unable to raise additional capital when needed, we might have to delay, curtail or eliminate one or more of our R&D programs and commercialization efforts and potentially change our growth strategy.\nRaising additional funds by issuing securities or through licensing or lending arrangements may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish proprietary rights.\nTo the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, the share ownership of existing stockholders will be diluted. Any future debt financing may involve covenants that restrict our operations, including limitations on our ability to incur liens or additional debt, pay dividends, redeem our stock, make certain investments and engage in certain merger, consolidation or asset sale transactions, among other restrictions. In addition, if we raise additional funds through licensing arrangements, it may be necessary to relinquish potentially valuable rights to our product candidates, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.\nIf we fail to maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting in the future, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired, which could harm our operating results, investors\u2019 views of us and, as a result, the value of our Common Stock.\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 and related rules, or SOX, our management is required to report on, and our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. The rules governing the standards that must be met for management to assess our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation. To comply with the requirements of being a reporting company under the Exchange Act, we may need to further upgrade our systems, including information technology, implement additional financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures and hire additional accounting and finance staff. If material weaknesses or deficiencies in our internal controls exist and go undetected, our financial statements could contain material misstatements that, when discovered in the future could cause us to fail to meet our future reporting obligations and cause the price of our Common Stock to decline.\nRisks Associated with our Capital Stock\nSome of our executives, directors and principal stockholders can control our direction and policies, and their interests may be adverse to the interests of our other stockholders.\nAt December 31, 2014, Lindsay A. Rosenwald, M.D., our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, beneficially owned approximately 12.4% of our issued and outstanding capital stock. At December 31, 2014, Michael S. Weiss, our Executive Vice Chairman, Strategic Development, beneficially owned approximately 14.9% of our issued and outstanding capital stock. By virtue of their holdings and membership on our board of directors, Dr. Rosenwald and Mr. Weiss may individually influence our management and our affairs and may make it difficult for us to consummate corporate transactions such as mergers, consolidations or the sale of all or substantially all of our assets that may be favorable from our standpoint or that of our other stockholders.\nIn addition, several of our directors may influence the election of members to our board of directors. On February 20, 2014, Drs. Harvey, Rosenwald and Rowinsky and Messrs. Barrett, Lobell and Weiss, entered into a Shareholders\u2019 Agreement, pursuant to which they agreed that, until the end of our annual meeting held in calendar year 2016 and so long as Dr. Rosenwald and Mr. Weiss are on the proposed slate of directors to be nominated, they each will vote all of their shares of Company Common Stock in favor of electing those individuals, and only those individuals, to our board of directors whom our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee proposes. Until that time, they also agreed to not publicly or otherwise advocate for or encourage in any way (outside of fulfilling their director duties) the election of any individual to our board of directors whom is not proposed by our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.\nThe market price of our Common Stock may be volatile and may fluctuate in a way that is disproportionate to our operating performance.\nOur stock price may experience substantial volatility as a result of a number of factors, including:\n\u2022 Announcements we make regarding our current product candidates, the acquisition of potential new product candidates and/or in-licensing through multiple subsidiaries;\n\u2022 sales or potential sales of substantial amounts of our Common Stock;\n\u2022 delay or failure in initiating or completing pre-clinical or clinical trials or unsatisfactory results of any of these trials;\n\u2022 announcements about us or about our competitors, including clinical trial results, regulatory approvals or new product introductions;\n\u2022 developments concerning our licensors, product manufacturers or our ability to produce TSO;\n\u2022 litigation and other developments relating to our patents or other proprietary rights or those of our competitors;\n\u2022 conditions in the pharmaceutical or biotechnology industries;\n\u2022 governmental regulation and legislation;\n\u2022 variations in our anticipated or actual operating results; and\n\u2022 change in securities analysts\u2019 estimates of our performance, or our failure to meet analysts\u2019 expectations.\nMany of these factors are beyond our control. The stock markets in general, and the market for pharmaceutical and biotechnological companies in particular, have historically experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. These broad market and industry factors could reduce the market price of our Common Stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. Most significantly and subsequent to the release of the results from our TRUST-I clinical trial, the price of our stock dropped $4.05, or 70%, from $5.77 at October 11, 2013 to $1.72 on October 21, 2013.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our Common Stock, or the perception that such sales may occur, may adversely impact the price of our Common Stock.\nAlmost all of our 46.5 million outstanding shares of Common Stock as of December 31, 2014, are available for sale in the public market, either pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, or an effective registration statement. In addition, in July 2013, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3, which was declared effective on August 19, 2013. Under the 2013 Form S-3 and an amended At-Market Issuance Sales Agreement entered into with MLV LLC in connection therewith, or the 2013 ATM, we may offer and sell shares of Common Stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $70.0 million. As of December 31, 2014, approximately $54 million remains available for issuance under the 2013 ATM.\nWe have never paid and do not intend to pay cash dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, will be your sole source of gain.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on any of our capital stock and we currently intend to retain future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. In addition, the terms of existing and future debt agreements may preclude us from paying dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our Common Stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and Delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our Company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the trading price of our Common Stock.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and Delaware law may have the effect of deterring unsolicited takeovers or delaying or preventing a change in control of our Company or changes in our management, including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then-current market prices. In addition, these provisions may limit the ability of stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests. These provisions include:\n\u2022 the inability of stockholders to call special meetings; and\n\u2022 the ability of our board of directors to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could include the right to approve an acquisition or other change in our control or could be used to institute a rights plan, also known as a poison pill, that would work to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, likely preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our board of directors.\nIn addition, the Delaware General Corporation Law prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder, generally a person which together with its affiliates owns, or within the last three years, has owned 15% of our voting stock, for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nThe existence of the foregoing provisions and anti-takeover measures could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our Common Stock. They could also deter potential acquirers of our Company, thereby reducing the likelihood that you could receive a premium for your Common Stock in an acquisition.\nOn January 2, 2013, the President signed into law The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012. Under prior law, a taxpayer was entitled to a research credit for qualifying amounts paid or incurred on or before December 31, 2011. The Taxpayer Relief Act extended the research credit for two years to December 31, 2013. The extension of the research credit is retroactive and includes amounts paid or incurred after December 31, 2011. As a result of the retroactive extension, a benefit for qualifying amounts incurred in 2012 was recognized in the period of enactment, which was the first quarter of 2013.", "PERMNO": 13159, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "FBIO"}
