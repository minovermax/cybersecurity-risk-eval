{"cik": "71691", "company": "NEW YORK TIMES CO", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-27", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the risk factors described below, as well as the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any or all of these risks, or by other risks or uncertainties not presently known or currently deemed immaterial, that may adversely affect us in the future.\nWe face significant competition in all aspects of our business.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment. We compete for subscription and advertising revenue with both traditional and other content providers, as well as search engines and social media platforms. Competition among companies offering online content is intense, and new competitors can quickly emerge.\nOur ability to compete effectively depends on many factors both within and beyond our control, including among others:\n\u2022\nour ability to continue delivering high-quality journalism and content that is interesting and relevant to our audience;\n\u2022\nour reputation and brand strength relative to those of our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe popularity, usefulness, ease of use, performance and reliability of our digital products compared with those of our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe engagement of our audience, and our ability to reach new users;\n\u2022\nour ability to develop, maintain and monetize our products;\n\u2022\nthe pricing of our products;\n\u2022\nour marketing and selling efforts, including our ability to differentiate our products and services from those of our competitors;\n\u2022\nour visibility on search engines and social media platforms and in mobile app stores, compared with that of our competitors;\n\u2022\nour ability to provide advertisers with a compelling return on their investments;\n\u2022\nour ability to attract, retain, and motivate talented employees, including journalists and product and technology specialists; and\n\u2022\nour ability to manage and grow our business in a cost-effective manner.\nSome of our current and potential competitors may have greater resources than we do, which may allow them to compete more effectively than us.\nOur success depends on our ability to respond and adapt to changes in technology and consumer behavior.\nTechnology in the media industry continues to evolve rapidly. Advances in technology have led to an increased number of methods for the delivery and consumption of news and other content. These developments are also driving changes in the preferences and expectations of consumers as they seek more control over how they consume content.\nChanges in technology and consumer behavior pose a number of challenges that could adversely affect our revenues and competitive position. For example, among others:\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to develop digital products that consumers find engaging, that work with a variety of operating systems and networks and that achieve a high level of market acceptance;\nP. 6 - THE NEW YORK TIMES COMPANY\n\u2022\nwe may introduce new products or services, or make changes to existing products and services, that are not favorably received by consumers;\n\u2022\nthere may be changes in user sentiment about the quality or usefulness of our existing products or concerns related to privacy, security or other factors;\n\u2022\nfailure to successfully manage changes implemented by social media platforms, search engines, news aggregators or mobile app stores and device manufacturers, including those affecting how our content and applications are prioritized, displayed and monetized, could affect our business;\n\u2022\nconsumers may increasingly use technology (such as incognito browsing) that decreases our ability to enforce limits on the free access we provide to our content and/or obtain a complete view of the behavior of users who engage with our products;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to maintain or update our technology infrastructure in a way that meets market and consumer demands; and\n\u2022\nthe consumption of our content on delivery platforms of third parties may lead to limitations on monetization of our products, the loss of control over distribution of our content and of a direct relationship with our audience, and lower engagement and subscription rates.\nWe continue to invest significant resources to mitigate these potential risks and to build, maintain and evolve our products and technology infrastructure. These investments may adversely impact our operating results in the near term and there can be no assurance as to our ability to use new and existing technologies to distinguish our products and services from those of our competitors and develop in a timely manner compelling new products and services that engage users across platforms. If we are not successful in responding to changes in technology and consumer behavior, our business, financial condition and prospects may be adversely affected.\nA failure to continue to retain and grow our subscriber base could adversely affect our results of operations and business.\nRevenue from subscriptions to our print and digital products makes up a majority of our total revenue. Subscription revenue is sensitive to discretionary spending and economic conditions in the markets we serve. To the extent poor economic conditions lead consumers to reduce spending on discretionary activities, our ability to retain current and obtain new subscribers could be hindered, thereby reducing our subscription revenue. In addition, the growth rate of new subscriptions to our products that are driven by significant news events and/or promotional pricing may not be sustainable.\nSubscriptions to our digital products generate substantial revenue for us, and our future growth depends upon our ability to retain and grow our digital subscriber base and audience. To do so will require us to continue to evolve our subscription model, address changing consumer demands and developments in technology and improve our digital products while continuing to deliver high-quality journalism and content that our readers find interesting, relevant and reliable. We have invested and will continue to invest significant resources in these efforts, but there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully maintain and increase our digital subscriber base or that we will be able to do so without taking steps such as reducing pricing or incurring subscription acquisition costs that would affect our subscription revenues, margin and/or profitability.\nOur ability to retain and grow our digital subscriber base also depends on the engagement of users with our products, including the frequency, breadth and depth of their use. If users become less engaged with our products, they may be less likely to purchase subscriptions or renew their existing subscriptions, which would adversely affect our subscription revenues. In addition, we have implemented and may continue to implement changes in the free access we provide to our content and/or the pricing of our subscriptions that could have an adverse impact on our ability to attract and retain subscribers.\nPrint subscriptions continue to decline as the media industry has transitioned from being primarily print-focused to digital. If we are unable to offset continued revenue declines resulting from falling print subscriptions with revenue from home-delivery price increases, our print subscription revenue will be adversely affected. In addition, if we are unable to offset and ultimately replace continued print subscription revenue declines with other sources of revenue, our operating results will be adversely affected.\nTHE NEW YORK TIMES COMPANY - P. 7\nOur advertising revenues are affected by numerous external factors, including economic conditions, market dynamics, audience fragmentation and evolving digital advertising trends.\nWe derive substantial revenues from the sale of advertising in our products. Advertising spending is sensitive to overall economic conditions, and our advertising revenues could be adversely affected if advertisers respond to weak and uneven economic conditions by reducing their budgets or shifting spending patterns or priorities, or if they are forced to consolidate or cease operations. Among other things, an economic slowdown or other negative impact on worldwide economic conditions from the outbreak and spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19) could materially adversely impact our advertising revenues.\nIn determining whether to buy advertising, our advertisers consider the demand for our products, demographics of our reader base, advertising rates, results observed by advertisers, breadth of advertising offerings and alternative advertising options.\nAlthough print advertising revenue continues to represent a majority of our total advertising revenue (approximately 51% of our total advertising revenues in 2019), the overall proportion continues to decline. The increased popularity of digital media among consumers, particularly as a source for news and other content, has driven a corresponding shift in demand from print advertising to digital advertising. However, our digital advertising revenue has not replaced, and may not replace in full, print advertising revenue lost as a result of the shift.\nLarge digital platforms, such as Facebook, Google and Amazon, which have greater audience reach, audience data and targeting capabilities than we do, command a large share of the digital display advertising market, and we anticipate that this will continue. The remaining market is subject to significant competition among publishers and other content providers, and audience fragmentation. These dynamics have affected, and will likely continue to affect, our ability to attract and retain advertisers and to maintain or increase our advertising rates.\nThe digital advertising market itself continues to undergo change. Digital advertising networks and exchanges, real-time bidding and other programmatic buying channels that allow advertisers to buy audiences at scale play a significant role in the advertising marketplace and have caused and may continue to cause further downward pricing pressure and the loss of a direct relationship with marketers. Growing consumer reliance on mobile devices creates additional pressure, as mobile display advertising does not command the same rates as desktop advertising. Our digital advertising operations rely on a small number of significant technologies (particularly Google\u2019s ad manager) which, if interrupted or meaningfully changed, could have an adverse impact on our advertising revenues, operating costs and/or operating results.\nEvolving standards for the delivery of digital advertising, as well as the development and implementation of technology and policies that adversely affect our ability to deliver, target or measure the effectiveness of advertising (such as blocking the display of advertising and/or cookies), may also adversely affect our advertising revenues if we are unable to develop effective solutions to mitigate their impact.\nAs the digital advertising market continues to evolve, our ability to compete successfully for advertising budgets will depend on, among other things, our ability to engage and grow digital audiences and demonstrate the value of our advertising and the effectiveness of our products to advertisers.\nThere may be further downward pressure on our advertising revenue margins as our advertising business evolves.\nThe character of our advertising continues to change, as demand for newer forms of advertising such as branded content and other customized advertising increases. The margin on revenues from some of these advertising forms is generally lower than the margin on revenues we generate from our print advertising and traditional digital display advertising. Consequently, we may experience further downward pressure on our advertising revenue margins as a greater percentage of advertising revenues comes from these newer forms.\nWe have continued to take steps intended to improve our users\u2019 experiences and retain and grow our subscriber base. For example, in order to improve users\u2019 experiences, we have ceased presenting open-market programmatic advertising in our iOS and Android mobile applications. While these changes may result in long-term benefits for our advertising revenue, they may reduce the inventory for some of our digital advertising products or may otherwise impact advertising revenues.\nP. 8 - THE NEW YORK TIMES COMPANY\nInvestments we make in new and existing products and services expose us to risks and challenges that could adversely affect our operations and profitability.\nWe have invested and expect to continue to invest significant resources to enhance and expand our existing products and services and to develop new products and services. These investments have included, among others: enhancements to our core news product; our lifestyle products (including our Crossword, Cooking and Parenting products); investments in our podcasts and television initiatives; as well as our commercial printing and other ancillary operations. These efforts present numerous risks and challenges, including the potential need for us to develop additional expertise in certain areas; technological and operational challenges; the need to effectively allocate capital resources; new and/or increased costs (including marketing costs and costs to recruit, integrate and retain skilled employees); risks associated with new strategic relationships; new competitors (some of which may have more resources and experience in certain areas); and additional legal and regulatory risks from expansion into new areas. As a result of these and other risks and challenges, growth into new areas may divert internal resources and the attention of our management and other personnel, including journalists and product and technology specialists.\nAlthough we believe we have a strong and well-established reputation as a global media company, our ability to market these products effectively, and to gain and maintain an audience, particularly for some of our new digital products, is not certain, and if they are not favorably received, our brand may be adversely affected. Even if our new products and services, or enhancements to existing products and services, are favorably received, they may not advance our business strategy as expected, may result in unanticipated costs or liabilities and may fall short of expected return on investment targets or fail to generate sufficient revenue to justify our investments, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe fixed cost nature of significant portions of our expenses may limit our operating flexibility and could adversely affect our results of operations.\nSignificant portions of our expenses, including employee-related costs, are fixed costs that neither increase nor decrease proportionately with revenues. In addition, our ability to make short-term adjustments to manage our costs or to make changes to our business strategy may be limited by certain of our collective bargaining agreements. If we were unable to implement cost-control efforts or reduce our fixed costs sufficiently in response to a decline in our revenues, our results of operations will be adversely affected.\nSecurity breaches and other network and information systems disruptions could affect our ability to conduct our business effectively and damage our reputation.\nOur systems store and process confidential subscriber, employee and other sensitive personal and Company data, and therefore maintaining our network security is of critical importance. In addition, we rely on the technology and systems provided by third-party vendors (including cloud-based service providers) for a variety of operations, including encryption and authentication technology, employee email, domain name registration, content delivery to customers, administrative functions (including payroll processing and certain finance and accounting functions) and other operations.\nWe regularly face attempts by malicious actors to breach our security and compromise our information technology systems. These attackers may use a blend of technology and social engineering techniques (including denial of service attacks, phishing attempts intended to induce our employees and users to disclose information or unwittingly provide access to systems or data, and other techniques), to disrupt service or exfiltrate data. Information security threats are constantly evolving, increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. To date, no incidents have had, either individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition, our systems, and those of third parties upon which our business relies, may be vulnerable to interruption or damage that can result from natural disasters or the effects of climate change (such as increased storm severity and flooding), fires, power outages or internet outages, acts of terrorism or other similar events.\nWe have implemented controls and taken other preventative measures designed to strengthen our systems against such incidents and attacks, including measures designed to reduce the impact of a security breach at our third-party vendors. Although the costs of the controls and other measures we have taken to date have not had a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, there can be no assurance as to the costs of additional controls and measures that we may conclude are necessary in the future.\nTHE NEW YORK TIMES COMPANY - P. 9\nThere can also be no assurance that the actions, measures and controls we have implemented will be effective against future attacks or be sufficient to prevent a future security breach or other disruption to our network or information systems, or those of our third-party providers, and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. Such an event could result in a disruption of our services, improper disclosure of personal data or confidential information, or theft or misuse of our intellectual property, all of which could harm our reputation, require us to expend resources to remedy such a security breach or defend against further attacks, divert management\u2019s attention and resources or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data, or otherwise adversely affect our business. While we maintain cyber risk insurance, the costs relating to any data breach could be substantial, and our insurance may not be sufficient to cover all losses related to any future breaches of our systems.\nOur brand and reputation are key assets of the Company, and negative perceptions or publicity could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe believe The New York Times brand is a powerful and trusted brand with an excellent reputation for high-quality independent journalism and content, and this brand is a key element of our business. Our brand might be damaged by incidents that erode consumer trust (such as negative publicity), a perception that our journalism is unreliable or a decline in the perceived value of independent journalism. We may introduce new products or services that users do not like and that may negatively affect our brand. We also may fail to provide adequate customer service, which could erode confidence in our brand. Our reputation could also be damaged by failures of third-party vendors we rely on in many contexts. We are investing in defining and enhancing our brand. These investments are considerable and may not be successful. To the extent our brand and reputation are damaged, our ability to attract and retain readers, subscribers, advertisers and/or employees could be adversely affected, which could in turn have an adverse impact on our business, revenues and operating results.\nOur international operations expose us to economic and other risks inherent in foreign operations.\nWe have news bureaus and other offices around the world, and our digital and print products are generally available globally. We are focused on further expanding the international scope of our business, and face the inherent risks associated with doing business abroad, including:\n\u2022\neffectively managing and staffing foreign operations, including complying with local laws and regulations in each different jurisdiction;\n\u2022\nproviding for the safety and security of our journalists and other employees;\n\u2022\npotential economic, legal, political or social uncertainty and volatility in local or global market conditions (e.g., as a result of the implementation of the United Kingdom\u2019s referendum to withdraw membership from the European Union, commonly referred to as Brexit) or catastrophic events (e.g., a natural disaster, an act of terrorism, a pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of a disease or severe weather) that could adversely affect the companies with which we do business; cause changes in discretionary spending; or otherwise adversely impact our operations and business;\n\u2022\nnavigating local customs and practices;\n\u2022\ngovernment policies and regulations that restrict the digital flow of information, which could block access to, or the functionality of, our products, or other retaliatory actions or behavior by government officials;\n\u2022\nprotecting and enforcing our intellectual property and other rights under varying legal regimes;\n\u2022\ncomplying with international laws and regulations, including those governing intellectual property, libel and defamation, consumer privacy and the collection, use, retention, sharing and security of consumer and staff data;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the ability of U.S. companies to do business in foreign countries, including restrictions on foreign ownership, foreign investment or repatriation of funds;\n\u2022\nhigher-than-anticipated costs of entry; and\n\u2022\ncurrency exchange rate fluctuations.\nAdverse developments in any of these areas could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, we may incur increased costs necessary to comply with existing and newly adopted laws and regulations or penalties for any failure to comply.\nP. 10 - THE NEW YORK TIMES COMPANY\nIn addition, we have limited experience in developing and marketing our digital products in certain international regions and non-English languages and could be at a disadvantage compared with local and multinational competitors.\nFailure to comply with laws and regulations, including with respect to privacy, data protection and consumer marketing practices, could adversely affect our business.\nOur business is subject to various laws and regulations of local and foreign jurisdictions, including laws and regulations with respect to privacy and the collection and use of personal data, as well as laws and regulations with respect to consumer marketing practices.\nVarious federal and state laws and regulations, as well as the laws of foreign jurisdictions, govern the processing (including the collection, use, retention and sharing) and security of the data we receive from and about individuals. Failure to protect confidential data, provide individuals with adequate notice of our privacy policies or obtain required valid consent, for example, could subject us to liabilities imposed by these jurisdictions. Existing privacy-related laws and regulations are evolving and subject to potentially differing interpretations, and various federal and state legislative and regulatory bodies, as well as foreign legislative and regulatory bodies, may expand current or enact new laws regarding privacy and data protection. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation adopted by the European Union imposes more stringent data protection requirements and significant penalties for noncompliance; California\u2019s Consumer Privacy Act creates new data privacy rights; and the European Union\u2019s forthcoming ePrivacy Regulation is expected to impose, with respect to electronic communications, stricter data protection and data processing requirements.\nIn addition, various federal and state laws and regulations, as well as the laws of foreign jurisdictions, govern the manner in which we market our subscription products, including with respect to pricing and subscription renewals. These laws and regulations often differ across jurisdictions.\nExisting and newly adopted laws and regulations (or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations) have imposed and may continue to impose obligations that may affect our business, require us to incur increased compliance costs and cause us to further adjust our advertising or marketing practices. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us or the third parties upon which we rely to comply with laws and regulations that govern our business operations, as well as any failure, or perceived failure, by us or the third parties upon which we rely to comply with our own posted policies, could result in claims against us by governmental entities or others, negative publicity and a loss of confidence in us by our users and advertisers. Each of these potential consequences could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nAcquisitions, divestitures, investments and other transactions could adversely affect our costs, revenues, profitability and financial position.\nIn order to position our business to take advantage of growth opportunities, we engage in discussions, evaluate opportunities and enter into agreements for possible acquisitions, divestitures, investments and other transactions. We may also consider the acquisition of, or investment in, specific properties, businesses or technologies that fall outside our traditional lines of business and diversify our portfolio, including those that may operate in new and developing industries, if we deem such properties sufficiently attractive.\nAcquisitions may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in integrating acquired businesses (including cultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into our organization);\n\u2022\ndiversion of management attention from other business concerns or resources;\n\u2022\nuse of resources that are needed in other parts of our business;\n\u2022\npossible dilution of our brand or harm to our reputation;\n\u2022\nthe potential loss of key employees;\n\u2022\nrisks associated with integrating financial reporting, internal control and information technology systems; and\n\u2022\nother unanticipated problems and liabilities.\nTHE NEW YORK TIMES COMPANY - P. 11\nCompetition for certain types of acquisitions is significant. Even if successfully negotiated, closed and integrated, certain acquisitions or investments may prove not to advance our business strategy, may cause us to incur unanticipated costs or liabilities and may fall short of expected return on investment targets, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, we have divested and may in the future divest certain assets or businesses that no longer fit with our strategic direction or growth targets. Divestitures involve significant risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. These include, among others, the inability to find potential buyers on favorable terms, disruption to our business and/or diversion of management attention from other business concerns, loss of key employees and possible retention of certain liabilities related to the divested business.\nFinally, we have made investments in companies, and we may make similar investments in the future. Investments in these businesses subject us to the operating and financial risks of these businesses and to the risk that we do not have sole control over the operations of these businesses. Our investments are generally illiquid and the absence of a market may inhibit our ability to dispose of them. In addition, if the book value of an investment were to exceed its fair value, we would be required to recognize an impairment charge related to the investment.\nThe size and volatility of our pension plan obligations may adversely affect our operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nWe sponsor a frozen single-employer defined benefit pension plan. The Company and the NewsGuild of New York jointly sponsor a defined benefit plan that continues to accrue active benefits. Although we have frozen participation and benefits under our single employer plan, and have taken other steps to reduce the size and volatility of our pension plan obligations, our results of operations will be affected by the amount of income or expense we record for, and the contributions we are required to make to, these plans.\nWe are required to make contributions to our plans to comply with minimum funding requirements imposed by laws governing those plans. As of December 29, 2019, our qualified defined benefit pension plans were underfunded by approximately $12 million. Our obligation to make additional contributions to our plans, and the timing of any such contributions, depends on a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These include: legislative changes; assumptions about mortality; and economic conditions, including a low interest rate environment or sustained volatility and disruption in the stock and bond markets, which impact discount rates and returns on plan assets.\nAs a result of required contributions to our qualified pension plans, we may have less cash available for working capital and other corporate uses, which may have an adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nIn addition, the Company sponsors several non-qualified pension plans, with unfunded obligations totaling $248 million. Although we have frozen participation and benefits under all but one of these plans, and have taken other steps to reduce the size and volatility of our obligations under these plans, a number of factors, including changes in discount rates or mortality tables, may have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur participation in multiemployer pension plans may subject us to liabilities that could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe participate in, and make periodic contributions to, various multiemployer pension plans that cover many of our current and former production and delivery employees. Our required contributions to these plans could increase because of a shrinking contribution base as a result of the insolvency or withdrawal of other companies that currently contribute to these plans, the inability or failure of withdrawing companies to pay their withdrawal liability, low interest rates, lower than expected returns on pension fund assets, other funding deficiencies, or potential legislative action. Our withdrawal liability for any multiemployer pension plan will depend on the nature and timing of any triggering event and the extent of that plan\u2019s funding of vested benefits.\nIf a multiemployer pension plan in which we participate has significant underfunded liabilities, such underfunding will increase the size of our potential withdrawal liability. In addition, under federal pension law, special funding rules apply to multiemployer pension plans that are classified as \u201cendangered,\u201d \u201ccritical\u201d or \u201ccritical and declining.\u201d If plans in which we participate are in critical status, benefit reductions may apply and/or we could be required to make additional contributions.\nP. 12 - THE NEW YORK TIMES COMPANY\nWe have recorded significant withdrawal liabilities with respect to multiemployer pension plans in which we formerly participated (primarily in connection with the sales of the New England Media Group in 2013 and the Regional Media Group in 2012) and may record additional liabilities in the future. In addition, due to declines in our contributions, we have recorded withdrawal liabilities for actual and estimated partial withdrawals from several plans in which we continue to participate. Until demand letters from some of the multiemployer pension funds are received, the exact amount of the withdrawal liability will not be fully known and, as such, a difference from the recorded estimate could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Several of the multiemployer plans in which we participate are specific to the newspaper industry, which continues to undergo significant pressure. A withdrawal by a significant percentage of participating employers may result in a mass withdrawal declaration by the trustees of one or more of these plans, which would require us to record additional withdrawal liabilities.\nIf, in the future, we elect to withdraw from these plans or if we trigger a partial withdrawal due to declines in contribution base units or a partial cessation of our obligation to contribute, additional liabilities would need to be recorded that could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Legislative changes could also affect our funding obligations or the amount of withdrawal liability we incur if a withdrawal were to occur.\nA significant increase in the price of newsprint, or significant disruptions in our newsprint supply chain or newspaper printing and distribution channels, would have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nThe cost of raw materials, of which newsprint is the major component, represented approximately 5% of our total operating costs in 2019. The price of newsprint has historically been volatile and could increase as a result of various factors, including:\n\u2022\na reduction in the number of newsprint suppliers due to restructurings, bankruptcies, consolidations and conversions to other grades of paper;\n\u2022increases in supplier operating expenses due to rising raw material or energy costs or other factors;\n\u2022currency volatility;\n\u2022tariffs on certain paper imports from Canada into United States; and\n\u2022an inability to maintain existing relationships with our newsprint suppliers.\nWe also rely on suppliers for deliveries of newsprint, and the availability of our newsprint supply may be affected by various factors, including labor unrest, transportation issues and other disruptions that may affect deliveries of newsprint.\nOutside the New York area, The Times is printed and distributed under contracts with print and distribution partners across the United States and internationally. Financial pressures, newspaper industry economics or other circumstances affecting these print and distribution partners could lead to reduced operations or consolidations of print sites and/or distribution routes, which could increase the cost of printing and distributing our newspapers.\nIf newsprint prices increase significantly or we experience significant disruptions in our newsprint supply chain or newspaper printing and distribution channels, our operating results may be adversely affected.\nA significant number of our employees are unionized, and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if labor agreements were to further restrict our ability to maximize the efficiency of our operations.\nApproximately 43% of our full-time equivalent employees were represented by unions as of December 29, 2019, including editorial employees at Wirecutter who formed a union in 2019. As a result, we are required to negotiate the wage, benefits and other terms and conditions of employment with many of our employees collectively. Our results could be adversely affected if future labor negotiations or contracts were to further restrict our ability to maximize the efficiency of our operations, or if a larger percentage of our workforce were to be unionized. If we are unable to negotiate labor contracts on reasonable terms, or if we were to experience labor unrest or other business interruptions in connection with labor negotiations or otherwise, our ability to produce and deliver our products could be impaired. In addition, our ability to make adjustments to control compensation and benefits costs, change our strategy or otherwise adapt to changing business needs may be limited by the terms and duration of our collective bargaining agreements.\nTHE NEW YORK TIMES COMPANY - P. 13\nWe are subject to payment processing risk.\nWe accept payments using a variety of different payment methods, including credit and debit cards and direct debit. We rely on internal systems as well as those of third parties to process payments. Acceptance and processing of these payment methods are subject to certain certifications, rules and regulations. To the extent there are disruptions in our or third-party payment processing systems, material changes in the payment ecosystem, failure to recertify and/or changes to rules or regulations concerning payment processing, we could be subject to fines and/or civil liability, or lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments, which would harm our reputation and adversely impact our results of operations.\nDefects, delays or interruptions in the cloud-based hosting services we utilize could adversely affect our reputation and operating results.\nWe currently utilize third party subscription-based software services as well as public cloud infrastructure services to provide solutions for many of our computing and bandwidth needs. Any interruptions to these services generally could result in interruptions in service to our subscribers and advertisers and/or the Company\u2019s critical business functions, notwithstanding any business continuity or disaster recovery plans or agreements that may currently be in place with these providers. This could result in unanticipated downtime and/or harm to our reputation and operating results.\nOur business may suffer if we cannot protect our intellectual property.\nOur business depends on our intellectual property, including our valuable brands, content, services and internally developed technology. We believe our proprietary trademarks and other intellectual property rights are important to our continued success and our competitive position. Unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise unlawfully obtain and use our content, services, technology and other intellectual property, and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights will prevent any misappropriation or confusion among consumers and merchants, or unauthorized use of these rights.\nAdvancements in technology have made the unauthorized duplication and wide dissemination of content easier, making the enforcement of intellectual property rights more challenging. In addition, as our business and the risk of misappropriation of our intellectual property rights have become more global in scope, we may not be able to protect our proprietary rights in a cost-effective manner in a multitude of jurisdictions with varying laws.\nIf we are unable to procure, protect and enforce our intellectual property rights, including maintaining and monetizing our intellectual property rights to our content, we may not realize the full value of these assets, and our business and profitability may suffer. In addition, if we must litigate in the United States or elsewhere to enforce our intellectual property rights or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others, such litigation may be costly.\nWe have been, and may be in the future, subject to claims of intellectual property infringement that could adversely affect our business.\nWe periodically receive claims from third parties alleging infringement, misappropriation or other violations of their copyright, patent, trademark and similar intellectual property rights. These third parties include rights holders seeking to monetize intellectual property they own or otherwise have rights to through asserting claims of infringement or misuse. Even if we believe that these claims of intellectual property infringement are without merit, defending against the claims can be time-consuming, be expensive to litigate or settle, and cause diversion of management attention.\nThese intellectual property infringement claims, if successful, may require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms, use more costly alternative technology or otherwise incur substantial monetary liability. Additionally, these claims may require us to significantly alter certain of our operations. The occurrence of any of these events as a result of these claims could result in substantially increased costs or otherwise adversely affect our business.\nThe terms of our credit facility impose restrictions on our operations that could limit our ability to undertake certain actions.\nIn September 2019, we entered into a $250.0 million five-year unsecured credit facility (the \u201cCredit Facility\u201d). Certain of our domestic subsidiaries have guaranteed our obligations under the Credit Facility. As of December 29,\nP. 14 - THE NEW YORK TIMES COMPANY\n2019, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d for a description of the Credit Facility.\nThe Credit Facility contains various customary affirmative and negative covenants, including certain financial covenants and various incurrence-based negative covenants imposing potentially significant restrictions on our operations. These covenants restrict, subject to various exceptions, our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur debt (directly or by third party guarantees);\n\u2022\ngrant liens;\n\u2022\npay dividends;\n\u2022\nmake investments;\n\u2022\nmake acquisitions or dispositions; and\n\u2022\nprepay debt.\nAny of these restrictions and limitations could make it more difficult for us to execute our business strategy.\nWe may not have access to the capital markets on terms that are acceptable to us or may otherwise be limited in our financing options.\nFrom time to time the Company may need or desire to access the long-term and short-term capital markets to obtain financing. The Company\u2019s access to, and the availability of, financing on acceptable terms and conditions in the future will be impacted by many factors, including, but not limited to: (1) the Company\u2019s financial performance; (2) the Company\u2019s credit ratings or absence of a credit rating; (3) liquidity of the overall capital markets and (4) the state of the economy. There can be no assurance that the Company will continue to have access to the capital markets on terms acceptable to it.\nIn addition, macroeconomic conditions, such as volatility or disruption in the credit markets, could adversely affect our ability to obtain financing to support operations or to fund acquisitions or other capital-intensive initiatives.\nOur Class B Common Stock is principally held by descendants of Adolph S. Ochs, through a family trust, and this control could create conflicts of interest or inhibit potential changes of control.\nWe have two classes of stock: Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock. Holders of Class A Common Stock are entitled to elect 30% of the Board of Directors and to vote, with holders of Class B Common Stock, on the reservation of shares for equity grants, certain material acquisitions and the ratification of the selection of our auditors. Holders of Class B Common Stock are entitled to elect the remainder of the Board of Directors and to vote on all other matters. Our Class B Common Stock is principally held by descendants of Adolph S. Ochs, who purchased The Times in 1896. A family trust holds approximately 90% of the Class B Common Stock. As a result, the trust has the ability to elect 70% of the Board of Directors and to direct the outcome of any matter that does not require a vote of the Class A Common Stock. Under the terms of the trust agreement, the trustees are directed to retain the Class B Common Stock held in trust and to vote such stock against any merger, sale of assets or other transaction pursuant to which control of The Times passes from the trustees, unless they determine that the primary objective of the trust can be achieved better by the implementation of such transaction. Because this concentrated control could discourage others from initiating any potential merger, takeover or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be beneficial to our businesses, the market price of our Class A Common Stock could be adversely affected.\nAdverse results from litigation or governmental investigations can impact our business practices and operating results.\nFrom time to time, we are party to litigation, including matters relating to alleged libel or defamation and employment-related matters, as well as regulatory, environmental and other proceedings with governmental authorities and administrative agencies. See Note 20 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements regarding certain matters. Adverse outcomes in lawsuits or investigations could result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition as well as our ability to conduct our business as it is presently being conducted. In addition, regardless of merit or outcome, such proceedings can have an adverse impact on the Company as a result of legal costs, diversion of management and other personnel, and other factors.\nTHE NEW YORK TIMES COMPANY - P. 15", "PERMNO": 47466, "SIC": 2711, "TIC": "NYT"}
