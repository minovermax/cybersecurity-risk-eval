RISK FACTORS\nThis Item outlines specific risks that could affect the ability of our various businesses to compete, change our risk profile, or materially impact our operating results or financial condition. Our operating environment continues to evolve and new risks continue to emerge. To address that challenge we have a risk management governance structure that oversees processes for monitoring evolving risks and oversees various initiatives designed to manage and control our potential exposure.\nThe following discussion highlights risks which could impact us in material ways by causing our future\nresults to differ materially from our past results, by causing future results to differ materially from current expectations, or by causing material changes in our financial condition. In this Item we have outlined risks that we believe are important to us at the present time. However, other risks may prove to be important in the future, and new risks may emerge at any time. We cannot predict with certainty all potential developments which could materially affect our financial performance or condition.\nTABLE OF ITEM 1A TOPICS\nTopic Page\nForward-Looking Statements\nCompetition Risks\nRisk From Economic Downturns and Changes\nRisks Associated with Monetary Events\nStrategic and Macro Risks\nRisks Related to Businesses We May Exit\nLegacy Mortgage Business Risks\nReputation Risks\nCredit Risks\nOperational Risks\nService Risks\nTopic Page\nRegulatory, Legislative, and Legal Risks\nRisks of Expense Control\nGeographic Risks\nInsurance\nLiquidity and Funding Risks\nCredit Ratings\nInterest Rate and Yield Curve Risks\nAsset Inventories and Market Risks\nAccounting & Tax Risks\nTax Reform Law Risks\nRisks of Holding our Stock\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis report on Form 10-K and our 2017 Annual Report, including materials incorporated into either of them, may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 with respect to our beliefs, plans, goals, expectations, and estimates. Forward-looking statements are not a representation of historical information, but instead pertain to future operations, strategies, financial results or other developments. The words \u201cbelieve,\u201d \u201cexpect,\u201d \u201canticipate,\u201d \u201cintend,\u201d \u201cestimate,\u201d \u201cshould,\u201d \u201cis likely,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201cgoing forward,\u201d and other expressions that indicate future events and trends identify forward-looking statements.\nForward-looking statements are necessarily based upon estimates and assumptions that are inherently subject to significant business, operational, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control, and many of which, with respect to future business decisions and actions\n(including acquisitions and divestitures), are subject to change. Examples of uncertainties and contingencies include, among other important factors: global, general, and local economic and business conditions, including economic recession or depression; the stability or volatility of values and activity in the residential housing and commercial real estate markets; potential requirements for us to repurchase, or compensate for losses from, previously sold or securitized mortgages or securities based on such mortgages; potential claims alleging mortgage servicing failures, individually, on a class basis, or as master servicer of securitized loans; potential claims relating to participation in government programs, especially lending or other financial services programs; expectations of and actual timing and amount of interest rate movements, including the slope and shape of the yield curve, which can have a significant impact on a financial services institution; market and monetary fluctuations, including fluctuations in mortgage\nmarkets; inflation or deflation; customer, investor, competitor, regulatory, and legislative responses to any or all of these conditions; the financial condition of borrowers and other counterparties; competition within and outside the financial services industry; geopolitical developments including possible terrorist activity; natural disasters; effectiveness and cost-efficiency of our hedging practices; technological changes; fraud, theft, or other incursions through conventional, electronic, or other means affecting us directly or affecting our customers, business counterparties, or competitors; demand for our product offerings; new products and services in the industries in which we operate; the increasing use of new technologies to interact with customers and others; and critical accounting estimates. Other factors are those inherent in originating, selling, servicing, and holding loans and loan-based assets including prepayment risks, pricing concessions, fluctuation in U.S. housing and other real estate prices, fluctuation of collateral values, and changes in customer profiles. Additionally, the actions of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), the U.S. Department of the\nTreasury (Treasury), the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB), the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the Financial Stability Oversight Council (Council), the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), and other regulators and agencies; pending, threatened, or possible future regulatory, administrative, and judicial outcomes, actions, and proceedings; current or future Executive orders; changes in laws and regulations applicable to us; and our success in executing our business plans and strategies and managing the risks involved in the foregoing, could cause actual results to differ, perhaps materially, from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements.\nWe assume no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements that are made in this report on Form 10-K, in our 2017 Annual Report, or in any other statement, release, report, or filing from time to time. Actual results could differ and expectations could change, possibly materially, because of one or more factors, including those factors listed above or presented below, in other Items of this report, or in material incorporated by reference into this report. Readers of this report, including our 2017 Annual Report, should carefully consider the factors discussed in this Item 1A below, among others, in evaluating forward-looking statements and assessing our prospects.\nCompetition Risks\nWe are subject to intense competition for customers, and the nature of that competition is changing quickly. Our primary areas of competition for customers include: consumer and commercial deposits, commercial loans, consumer loans including home mortgages and lines of credit, financial planning and wealth management, fixed income products and services, and other consumer and commercial financial products and services. Our competitors in these areas include national, state, and non-US banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, consumer finance companies, trust companies, investment counseling firms, money market and other mutual funds, insurance companies and agencies, securities firms, mortgage banking companies, hedge funds, and other financial services companies (traditional and otherwise) that serve the markets which we serve.\nSome competitors are traditional banks, subject to the same regulatory framework as we are, while others are not banks and in many cases experience a significantly different or reduced degree of regulation. Long-standing examples of less-regulated activity include check-cashing and independent ATM services. A\nrecent example of unregulated activity is so-called \u201cpeer-to-peer\u201d lending, where investors provide debt capital directly to borrowers.\nThrough technological innovations and changes in customer habits, the manner in which customers use financial services is changing. We provide a large number of services remotely (desktop, online, or mobile), and physical branch utilization has been in long-term decline throughout the industry for many years. Technology has helped us reduce costs and improve service, but also has allowed disruptors to enter traditional banking areas. Some traditional consumer banking services are largely provided through retailers, especially grocery stores and so-called super-stores which customers visit frequently. Companies as disparate as PayPal (an online payment clearinghouse) and Starbucks (a large chain of cafes) provide payment and exchange services which compete directly with banks in ways not possible until recent times.\nAlso, the nature of technology-driven competition is starting to change. A number of recent technologies\nhave worked with the existing financial system and traditional banks, such as the evolution of ATM cards into debit/credit cards and the evolution of debit/credit cards into smart phones. These sorts of technologies often have expanded the market for banking services overall while siphoning a portion of the revenues from those services away from banks and disrupting prior methods of delivering those services. But some recent innovations may tend to replace traditional banks as financial service providers rather than merely augment those services\nFor example, companies which claim to offer applications and services based on artificial intelligence are beginning to compete much more directly with traditional financial services companies in areas involving personal advice, including high-margin services such as financial planning and wealth management. The low-cost, high-speed nature of these \u201crobo-advisor\u201d services can be especially attractive to younger, less-affluent customers and potential customers.\nSimilarly, crypto-currencies and other inventions based on blockchain technology eventually may be the foundation for greatly enhancing transactional security throughout the banking industry, but also may eventually greatly reduce the need for banks as financial deposit-keepers and intermediaries.\nWe expect that competition will continue to grow more intense with respect to most of our products and services. Heightened competition tends to put downward pressure on revenues from affected items, upward pressure on marketing and other promotional costs, or both. For additional information regarding competition for customers, refer to the \u201cCompetition\u201d heading of Item 1 beginning on page 14 of this report.\nWe compete for talent. Our most significant competitors for customers also are our most significant competitors for top talent. See \u201cOperational Risks\u201d beginning on page 25 of this Item 1A for additional information concerning this risk.\nWe compete to raise capital in the equity and debt markets. See \u201cLiquidity and Funding Risks\u201d beginning on page 29 of this Item 1A for additional information concerning this risk.\nRisk from Economic Downturns and Changes\nGenerally in an economic downturn our credit losses increase, demand for our products and services declines, and the credit quality of our loan portfolio declines. Delinquencies and credit losses generally increase during economic downturns due to an increase in liquidity problems for customers and downward pressure on collateral values. Likewise, demand for loans (at a given level of creditworthiness), deposit and other products, and financial services may decline during an economic downturn, and may be adversely affected by other national, regional, or local economic factors that impact demand for loans and\nother financial products and services. Such factors include, for example, changes in employment rates, interest rates, real estate prices, or expectations concerning rates or prices. Accordingly, an economic downturn or other adverse economic change (local, regional, national, or global) can hurt our financial performance in the form of higher loan losses, lower loan production levels, lower deposit levels, compression of our net interest margin, and lower fees from transactions and services. Those effects can continue for many years after the downturn technically ends.\nRisks Associated with Monetary Events\nThe Federal Reserve has implemented significant economic strategies that have impacted interest rates, inflation, asset values, and the shape of the yield curve, and currently is transitioning from many years of easing to what may be an uneven, but extended, period of tightening. In recent years, in response to the recession in 2008 and the following uneven recovery, the Federal Reserve implemented a series of domestic monetary initiatives. Several of these have emphasized so-called quantitative easing strategies, the most recent of which ended during 2014. Since then the Federal Reserve raised rates five times during 2015-2017, in each case by a modest 25 basis points. Further rate changes reportedly are dependent on the Federal Reserve\u2019s assessment of economic data as it becomes available. This data-dependent process, now in its fourth year, may represent a fitful transition to a tightening trend, or it may represent merely an\ninterim period during which rates have little clear up or down long-term trend.\nFederal Reserve strategies can, and often are intended to, affect the domestic money supply, inflation, interest rates, and the shape of the yield curve. Effects on the yield curve often are most pronounced at the short end of the curve, which is of particular importance to us and other banks. Among other things, easing strategies are intended to lower interest rates, flatten the yield curve, expand the money supply, and stimulate economic activity, while tightening strategies are intended to increase interest rates, steepen the yield curve, tighten the money supply, and restrain economic activity. Other things being equal, a transition from easing to tightening should tend to diminish or reverse downward pressure on rates, and to diminish or end the stimulus effect that low rates tend to have on the economy. Many external\nfactors may interfere with the effects of these plans or cause them to be changed unexpectedly. Such factors include significant economic trends or events as well as significant international monetary policies and events. An example of the former is the substantial drop in oil prices experienced during 2015 and the first half of 2016. An example of the latter is the July 2016 United Kingdom referendum calling for the U.K. to leave the European Union. Such strategies also can affect the U.S. and world-wide financial systems in ways that may be difficult to predict. For example, recent tightening by the Federal Reserve has at times flattened, rather than steepened, the yield curve due in part to high non-US demand for US-dollar fixed income securities. Risks associated with interest rates and the yield curve are discussed in this Item 1A under the caption \u201cInterest Rate and Yield Curve Risks\u201d beginning on page 31.\nWe may be adversely affected by economic and political situations outside the U.S. The U.S. economy, and the businesses of many of our customers, are linked significantly to economic and market conditions outside the U.S., especially in North America, Europe, and Asia, and increasingly in Central\nand South America. Although we have little direct exposure to non-US-dollar-denominated assets or non-US sovereign debt, in the future major adverse events outside the U.S. could have a substantial indirect adverse impact upon us. Key potential events which could have such an impact include (i) sovereign debt default (default by one or more governments in their borrowings), (ii) bank and/or corporate debt default, (iii) market and other liquidity disruptions, and, if stresses become especially severe, (iv) the collapse of governments, alliances, or currencies, and (v) military conflicts. The methods by which such events could adversely affect us are highly varied but broadly include the following: an increase in our cost of borrowed funds or, in a worst case, the unavailability of borrowed funds through conventional markets; impacts upon our hedging and other counterparties; impacts upon our customers; impacts upon the U.S. economy, especially in the areas of employment rates, real estate values, interest rates, and inflation/deflation rates; and impacts upon us from our regulatory environment, which can change substantially and unpredictably from possible political response to major financial disruptions.\nStrategic and Macro Risks\nWe may be unable to successfully implement our strategy to grow our consumer and commercial banking businesses and our fixed income business. In 2007 and 2008 we modified our strategy in response to substantial and rapid changes in business conditions. In 2008 we sold our national mortgage platforms and closed our national lending operations. Since then we have closed a number of other units and sold loans and servicing assets, further reducing our exposure to legacy operations. More importantly, we renewed our emphasis on traditional banking and fixed income products and services.\nAlthough our current strategy is expected to evolve as business conditions continue to change, at present our strategy is primarily to invest resources in our banking and fixed income businesses. Growth is expected to be coordinated with a focus on stronger and more stable returns on capital. In the past three years we have created a mix of organic growth, several tactical acquisitions, and a strategic acquisition (Capital Bank).\nOrganically, we have enhanced our market share in our traditional banking markets with targeted hires and marketing, expanded into other southeast U.S. markets with similar characteristics, and expanded with commercial lending and private client banking in the Houston, Texas market. We have made similar moves in our fixed income business.\nOur acquisitions in the past three years have included two banks, commercial loan portfolios, a commercial loan placement and servicing business, and a fixed income firm specializing in government guaranteed loans. The Capital Bank transaction late in 2017 re-introduced us to the consumer mortgage business, though that business is much more modest than the \u2018national\u2019 mortgage businesses we exited in 2008.\nIn the future, we expect to pursue acquisitions if appropriate opportunities, within or outside of our current markets, present themselves, and we expect to continue to nurture profitable organic growth as well. We believe that the successful execution of our strategy depends upon a number of key elements, including:\n\u25cf our ability to attract and retain customers in our banking market areas;\n\u25cf our ability to achieve and maintain growth in our earnings while pursuing new business opportunities;\n\u25cf in our fixed income business, our ability to maintain or strengthen our existing customer relationships while at the same time identifying and successfully executing upon opportunities to provide new or existing products and services to new or existing customers;\n\u25cf our ability to maintain a high level of customer service while reducing our physical branch count due to changing customer demand, all while expanding our remote banking services and expanding or enhancing our information processing, technology, compliance, and other operational infrastructures effectively and efficiently;\n\u25cf our ability to manage the liquidity and capital requirements associated with growth, especially organic growth and cash-funded acquisitions; and\n\u25cf our ability to manage effectively and efficiently the changes and adaptations necessitated by a complex, burdensome, and evolving regulatory environment.\nWe have in place strategies designed to achieve those elements that are significant to us at present. Our challenge is to execute those strategies and adjust them, or adopt new strategies, as conditions change.\nTo the extent we engage in bank or non-bank business acquisitions, we face various additional risks, including:\n\u25cf our ability to identify, analyze, and correctly assess the execution, credit, contingency, and other risks in the acquisition and to price the transaction appropriately;\n\u25cf our ability to integrate the acquired company into our operations quickly and cost-effectively;\n\u25cf our ability to manage any operational or cultural assimilation risks associated with growth through acquisitions;\n\u25cf our ability to integrate the franchise value of the acquired company with our own;\n\u25cf our ability to retain core customers and key employees of the acquired company; and,\n\u25cf under current laws, the prospect of substantially increased regulatory burdens and costs if we exceed $50 billion in asset size.\nA type of strategic acquisition-a so-called \u201cmerger of equals\u201d where the company we nominally acquire has similar size, operating contribution, or value-presents unique opportunities but also unique risks. Those special risks include:\n\u25cf the potential for elevated and duplicative operating expenses if we are unable to integrate the two companies efficiently in a reasonable amount of time; and,\n\u25cf a significant increase in the time horizon that may be needed before any substantial economies of scale are realized.\nJust as disruptive business changes driven by new technologies and new customer preferences can adversely impact us and our entire industry, similar events can adversely impact our commercial customers. In time, a major business disruption can cause long-standing or dominant businesses to fail, and can shrink or even end entire lines of business. An example of this is the business failure of the Blockbuster video distribution chain and most other video distribution stores, and the rise of Netflix. Many other examples of this kind of process are ongoing today in many industries, including publishing, retail sales, news, and the creation as well as distribution of audio and video entertainment. To the extent disruptions impact our customers, we may experience elevated loan losses and loss of ongoing business which we may not be able to recapture with new commercial customers.\nRisks Related to Businesses We May Exit\nWe may be unable to successfully implement a disposition of businesses or units which no longer fit our strategic plans. We could have closures and divestitures as we continue to adapt to a changing business and regulatory environment. Key risks associated with exiting a business include:\n\u25cf our ability to price a sale transaction appropriately and otherwise negotiate acceptable terms;\n\u25cf our ability to identify and implement key customer, technology systems, and other transition\nactions to avoid or minimize negative effects on retained businesses;\n\u25cf our ability to assess and manage any loss of synergies that the exited business had with our retained businesses; and\n\u25cf our ability to manage capital, liquidity, and other challenges that may arise if an exit results in significant legacy cash expenditures or financial loss.\nLegacy Mortgage Business Risks\nWe have risks from the mortgage-related businesses we exited, including mortgage loan repurchase and loss-reimbursement risk, claims of improper foreclosure practices, claims of non-compliance with contractual and regulatory requirements, and the risk of higher default rates on loans made by our former businesses. In 2008 we exited our national mortgage and national specialty lending businesses. However, we still retain as assets a significant amount of loans that those businesses created. Most of those\nloans are secured by residential or other real estate situated across the U.S. We retain the risk of liability to customers and contractual parties with whom we dealt in the course of operating those businesses. These legacy assets and obligations continue to impose risks on us. Key risks include:\n\u25cf We experienced elevated losses related to claims that we did not comply with contractual or other legal requirements when we sold mortgage loans.\nLosses may continue, irregularly. Although our expenses related to these matters have declined substantially, and in recent years we have experienced reserve releases, new information could be received in the future resulting in adverse adjustments related to exposures. Our total repurchase and foreclosure provision expense was $170.0 million for 2013, negative $4.3 million for 2014, zero for 2015, negative $32.7 million for 2016, and negative $22.5 million for 2017.\n\u25cf We are defending litigation matters associated with claims arising out of our former mortgage securitization activities. The outcome of those matters is uncertain; losses in excess of current accruals (reserves) could be material.\n\u25cf The trustee for those securitizations could demand repurchase of loans placed into securitizations or make-whole damages if we breached contractual requirements or obligations, or could demand that we indemnify the trustee if the trustee is sued. We have received one such indemnity demand, for expenses.\n\u25cf We have responded to investigations and inquiries by various parties, including government agencies, related to mortgage loans we originated. Inquiries have been wide ranging. A few have led to litigation. One investigation, involving the FHA insurance program, led to a settlement of $212.5 million in 2015.\n\u25cf We could be subject to claims that servicing-related actions were done improperly, or improperly were not done. Although we may be able to demand indemnity in cases where servicing was performed on our behalf by another institution, there is risk that such an indemnity demand could be refused by the institution or rejected by an appropriate court.\nOther trends adverse to us may emerge from this legacy business. Additional information concerning risks related to our former mortgage businesses and our management of them, all of which is incorporated into this Item 1A by this reference, is set forth: under the captions \u201cRepurchase Obligations, Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, and Other Contractual Obligations\u201d beginning on page 61, \u201cRepurchase and Foreclosure Liability\u201d beginning on page 65, and \u201cRepurchase and Foreclosure Liability\u201d beginning on page 68 of the Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of our 2017 Annual Report, which is part of the material from that report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of this report; and under the captions \u201cMaterial Matters\u201d and \u201cObligations from Legacy Mortgage Businesses\u201d beginning on pages 141 and 142, respectively, which is part of the material from our\nAnnual Report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 8 of this report.\nWe have exposures related to the mortgage servicing obligations and assets which we retained after we generally sold our mortgage businesses in 2008, especially in relation to the subservicing arrangements we made between 2008 and the sale of substantially all our remaining servicing assets completed in 2014. When we sold our origination and servicing businesses in 2008 we retained significant servicing obligations and assets. At that time we engaged as our subservicer the purchaser of our business. In 2011 that engagement expired and we engaged a new subservicer. Our 2008 subservicer experienced significant losses in connection with its servicing business. Our 2008 subservicer has informed us that it expects us to reimburse it for a significant portion of its losses and costs under our subservicing agreement. We disagree with our 2008 subservicer\u2019s position and have made no reimbursements. We also believe that certain amounts billed us by agencies for penalties and curtailments of claims by the subservicer prior to the 2011 subservicing transfer but billed after that date are owed by the subservicer. This disagreement has the potential to result in litigation and, in any such future litigation, the claim against us may be substantial.\nIn addition, our 2011 subservicer has asserted several categories of contractual indemnity obligations under agreements we have with that subservicer. Although no litigation is pending, this matter has the potential to result in a substantial claim against us.\nAdditional information concerning risks related to former servicing and foreclosure practices and our management of them, all of which is incorporated into this Item 1A by this reference, is set forth: under the captions \u201cRepurchase and Foreclosure Liability\u201d beginning on page 65, \u201cForeclosure Practices\u201d beginning on page 67, and \u201cRepurchase and Foreclosure Liability\u201d beginning on page 68 of the Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of our 2017 Annual Report, which is part of the material from that report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of this report; and under the captions \u201cServicing Obligations\u201d and \u201cRepurchase and Foreclosure Liability\u201d in Note 17-Contingencies and Other Disclosures, beginning on pages 143 and 144, respectively, of our 2017 Annual Report, which is part of the material from that report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 8 of this report.\nSeveral large purchasers of mortgage-backed securities have filed suits against the trustees for those securitizations asserting various theories of liability. The trustee of our securitizations is defending\nsuch matters, and many of our securitizations are among those alleged to have been purchased by the plaintiffs. The claims for damages are based in part on allegations that the trustee did not properly or timely act against the originators of the securitizations or the servicers of the loans, and further assert that the trustee has affirmative duties to act which were not set forth in\nthe legal trust documents. Some of the legal theories advanced are untested or unsettled. Although we are not a defendant in these proceedings, these complex suits may progress or evolve so as to compel us to defend ourselves or our trustee, and could create financial exposure for us.\nReputation Risks\nOur ability to conduct and grow our businesses, and to obtain and retain customers, is highly dependent upon external perceptions of our business practices and financial stability. Our reputation is, therefore, a key asset for us. Our reputation is affected principally by our business practices and how those practices are perceived and understood by others. Adverse perceptions regarding the practices of our competitors, or our industry as a whole, also may adversely impact our reputation. In addition, negative perceptions relating to parties with whom we have important relationships may adversely impact our reputation. Senior management oversees processes for reputation risk monitoring, assessment, and management.\nDamage to our reputation could hinder our ability to access the capital markets or otherwise impact our liquidity, could hamper our ability to attract new customers and retain existing ones, could impact the market value of our stock, could create or aggravate regulatory difficulties, and could undermine our ability to attract and retain talented employees, among other things. Adverse impacts on our reputation, or the reputation of our industry, may also result in greater regulatory and/or legislative scrutiny, which may lead to laws or regulations that change or constrain our business or operations. Events that result in damage to our reputation also may increase our litigation risk.\nCredit Risks\nWe face the risk that our customers may not repay their loans and that the realizable value of collateral may be insufficient to avoid a charge-off. We also face risks that other counterparties, in a wide range of situations, may fail to honor their obligations to pay us. In our business some level of credit charge-offs is unavoidable and overall levels of credit charge-offs can vary substantially over time. To take the most recent example, net charge-offs were $131.8 million in 2007, and increased to $572.8 million and $832.3 million in 2008 and 2009, respectively. Beginning in 2010, net charge-offs began to decline, reaching $31.2 million in 2015, $19.2 million in 2016, and $12.5 million in 2017. In recent years, our loan loss reserves also have declined from high levels. The allowance for loan loss was $189.6 million as of December 31, 2017, down substantially from $896.9 million and $849.2 million at year-end 2009 and 2008, respectively.\nOur ability to manage credit risks depends primarily upon our ability to assess the creditworthiness of loan customers and other counterparties and the value of any collateral, including real estate, among other things. We further manage lending credit risk by diversifying our loan portfolio, by managing its granularity, by following per-relationship lending limits, and by recording and managing an allowance for loan losses based on the factors mentioned above and in accordance with applicable accounting rules.\nWe further manage other counterparty credit risk in a variety of ways, some of which are discussed in other parts of this Item 1A and all of which have as a primary goal the avoidance of having too much risk concentrated with any single counterparty.\nWe record loan charge-offs in accordance with accounting and regulatory guidelines and rules. As indicated in this Item 1A under the caption \u201cAccounting & Tax Risks\u201d beginning on page 32, these guidelines and rules could change and cause provision expense or charge-offs to increase, or to be recognized on an accelerated basis, for reasons not always related to the underlying performance of our portfolio. Moreover, the SEC or PCAOB could take accounting positions applicable to our holding company that may be inconsistent with those taken by the Federal Reserve, OCC, or other banking regulators.\nA significant challenge for us is to keep the credit and other models and approaches we use to originate and manage loans updated to take into account changes in the competitive environment, in real estate prices and other collateral values, in the economy, and in the regulatory environment, among other things, based on our experience originating loans and servicing loan portfolios. Changes in modeling could have significant impacts upon our reported financial results and condition. In addition, we use those models and approaches to manage our loan portfolios and lending\nbusinesses. To the extent our models and approaches are not consistent with underlying real-world conditions, our management decisions could be misguided or otherwise affected with substantial adverse consequences to us.\nA significant subset of our home equity lines of credit were originated prior to our mortgage platform sale in 2008. A large number of those loans recently have been and (through 2018) will be switching from interest-only payments to full amortization payments of principal and interest combined. In reserving for potential loss in this portfolio we model an increased rate of default associated with the higher monthly payment requirements when that switch occurs. Our modeling is based, among other things, on our experience with this portfolio, but risk remains that actual default rates could exceed our modeling.\nThe low-interest rate environment has elevated the traditional challenge for lenders and investors to balance taking on higher risk against the desire for higher income or yield. This challenge applies not only to credit risk in lending activities but also to default and rate risks regarding investments.\nAs interest rates rise, default risk also rises. As borrowers\u2019 obligations to pay interest increase, financial weaknesses become more evident. Initially this will result in lower consumer credit scores and lower commercial loan grading, and eventually will result in higher default rates.\nThe composition of our loan portfolio inherently increases our sensitivity to certain credit risks. At December 31, 2017, approximately 58% of total loans consisted of the commercial, financial, and industrial (C&I) category, while approximately 23% consisted of the consumer real estate category.\nThe largest component of the C&I category at year end was loans to finance and insurance companies, a component which represented about 18% of the C&I category at that time. The second largest component was loans to mortgage companies. As a result, approximately 31% of the C&I category was sensitive to impacts on the financial services industry. As discussed elsewhere in this Item 1A with respect to our company, the financial services industry is more sensitive to interest rate and yield curve changes, monetary policy, regulatory policy, changes in real estate and other asset values, and changes in general economic conditions, than many other industries. Negative impacts on the industry could dampen new lending in these lines of business and could create credit impacts for the loans in our portfolio.\nThe consumer real estate category contains a number of concentrations which affect credit risk assessment of the category.\n\u25cf Product concentration. The consumer real estate category consists primarily of consumer installment loans, and much of the remainder consists of home equity lines of credit.\n\u25cf Collateral concentration. This entire category is secured by residential real estate. Approximately 24% of the category consists of loans secured on a second-lien basis.\n\u25cf Geographic concentration. At year end about 51% of the category related to Tennessee customers, 16% related to North Carolina, 13% related to Florida, 4% related to California, and no other state represented more than 3% of the category.\n\u25cf Legacy concentration. We still have more than $1 billion of loans originated before 2009 by our legacy national mortgage lending business. Those include loans we originated and did not sell, along with loans we have repurchased in the course of resolving claims with loan buyers. Our legacy loan portfolio continues to shrink, but the rate of shrinkage is slowing.\nThe consumer real estate category is highly sensitive to economic impacts on consumer customers and on residential real estate values. Job loss or downward job migration, as well as significant life events such as divorce, death, or disability, can significantly impact credit evaluations of the portfolio. Also, in the current environment regulatory changes, discussed above and elsewhere in this Item 1A, are more likely to affect the consumer category and our accounting estimates of credit loss than other loan types.\nOur exposure to the volatile oil & gas industry is modest but growing. Our Houston office specializes in commercial lending, which in that office significantly focuses on three areas: energy, commercial real estate (CRE), and commercial, financial, & industrial (C&I). Much of our Houston business is connected, at least in part, to the energy industry, especially oil and gas production and distribution. In addition to general credit and other risks mentioned elsewhere in this Item 1A, the energy business and related assets are sensitive to a number of factors specific to that industry. Key among those is global demand for energy and other products from oil and gas in relation to supply. The shifting balance between demand and supply is expressed most simply in prices. Although the financial impact from recent oil-price volatility on our overall loan business was relatively modest, we did experience elevated charge-offs. The impact was moderate in part because we did not have a substantial portfolio in the industry before prices started to fall. Going forward, volatility in oil prices could impact our financial performance and growth of our Houston-based lending business.\nAdditional information concerning credit risks and our management of them is set forth under the captions \u201cAsset Quality\u201d beginning on page 31, \u201cCommercial Loan Portfolios\u201d beginning on page 31, \u201cConsumer Loan Portfolios\u201d beginning on page 38, \u201cCredit Risk Management\u201d beginning on page 57, and \u201cAllowance for Loan Losses\u201d beginning on page 67 of the\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of our 2017 Annual Report, which is part of the material from that report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of this report.\nOperational Risks\nOur ability to conduct and grow our businesses is dependent in part upon our ability to create, maintain, expand, and evolve an appropriate operational and organizational infrastructure, manage expenses, and recruit and retain personnel with the ability to manage a complex business. Operational risk can arise in many ways, including: errors related to failed or inadequate physical, operational, information technology, or other processes; faulty or disabled computer or other technology systems; fraud, theft, physical security breaches, electronic data and related security breaches, or other criminal conduct by employees or third parties; and exposure to other external events. Inadequacies may present themselves in myriad ways. Actions taken to manage one risk may be ineffective against others. For example, information technology systems may be insufficiently redundant to withstand a fire, incursion, malware, or other major casualty, and they may be insufficiently adaptable to new business conditions or opportunities. Efforts to make such systems more robust may also make them less adaptable. Also, our efforts to control expenses, which is a significant priority for us, increases our operational challenges as we strive to maintain customer service and compliance at high quality and low cost.\nA serious information technology security (cybersecurity) breach can cause significant damage and at the same time be difficult to detect even after it occurs. Among other things, that damage can occur due to outright theft or extortion of our funds, fraud or identity theft perpetrated on customers, or adverse publicity associated with a breach and its potential effects. Perpetrators potentially can be employees, customers, and certain vendors, all of whom legitimately have access to some portion of our systems, as well as outsiders with no legitimate access. Because of the potentially very serious consequences associated with these risks, our electronic systems and their upgrades need to address internal and external security concerns to a high degree, and our systems have to comply with applicable banking and other regulations pertaining to bank safety and customer protection. Although many of our defenses are systemic and highly technical, others are much older and more basic. For example, periodically we train all our employees to recognize red flags associated with\nfraud, theft, and other electronic crimes, and we educate our customers as well through regular and episodic security-oriented communications. We expect our systems and regulatory requirements to continue to evolve as technology and criminal techniques also continue to evolve.\nThe operational functions we outsource to third parties may experience similar disruptions that could adversely impact us and over which we may have limited control and, in some cases, limited ability to obtain quickly an alternate vendor. To the extent we rely on third party vendors to perform or assist operational functions, the challenge of managing the associated risks becomes more difficult.\nThe operational functions of business counterparties may experience disruptions that could adversely impact us and over which we may have limited or no control. For example, in recent years several major U.S. retailers, a major electronic mail provider, and a major credit reporting firm all experienced data systems incursions reportedly resulting in the thefts of credit and debit card information, online account information, and other data of millions of customers. Retailer incursions affect cards issued and deposit accounts maintained by many banks, including our Bank. Although our systems are not breached in retailer incursions, these events can increase account fraud and can cause us to reissue a significant number of account cards and take other costly steps to avoid significant theft loss to our Bank and our customers. Our ability to recoup our losses may be limited legally or practically in many situations. Other possible points of incursion or disruption not within our control include internet service providers, social media portals, distant-server (\u201ccloud\u201d) service providers, electronic data security providers, telecommunications companies, and smart phone manufacturers.\nFailure to build and maintain the necessary operational infrastructure, failure of that infrastructure to perform its functions, or failure of our disaster preparedness plans if primary infrastructure components suffer damage, can lead to risk of loss of service to customers, legal actions, and noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards. Additional information concerning\noperational risks and our management of them, all of which is incorporated into this Item 1A by this reference, appears under the caption \u201cOperational Risk Management\u201d beginning on page 56 of the Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of our 2017 Annual Report, which is part of the material from that report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of this report.\nThe delivery of financial services to customers and others increasingly depends upon technologies, systems, and multi-party infrastructures which are new, creating or enhancing several risks discussed elsewhere. Examples of the risks created or enhanced by the widespread and rapid adoption of relatively untested technologies include: security incursions; operational malfunctions or other disruptions; and legal claims of patent or other intellectual property infringement.\nCompetition for talent is substantial and increasing. Moreover, revenue growth in some business lines increasingly depends upon top talent. In the past three years the cost to us of hiring and retaining top\nrevenue-producing talent has increased, and that trend is likely to continue. The primary tools we use to attract and retain talent are: salaries; commission, incentive, and retention compensation programs; retirement benefits; change in control severance benefits; health and other welfare benefits; and our corporate culture. To the extent we are unable to use these tools effectively, we face the risk that, over time, our best talent will leave us and we will be unable to replace those persons effectively.\nIncentives might operate poorly or have unintended adverse effects. Incentive programs are difficult to design well, and even if well-designed often they must be updated to address changes in our business. A poorly designed incentive program-where goals are too difficult, too easy, or not well related to desired outcomes-could provide little useful motivation to key employees, could increase turnover, and could impact customer retention. Moreover, even where those pitfalls are avoided, incentive programs may create unintended adverse consequences. For example, a program focused entirely on revenue production, without proper controls, may result in costs growing faster than revenues.\nService Risks\nWe provide a wide range of services to customers, and the provision of these services may create claims against us that we provided them in a manner that harmed the customer or a third party, or was not compliant with applicable laws or rules. Our services include lending, loan servicing, fiduciary, custodial, depositary, funds management, insurance, and advisory services, among others. We manage these risks primarily through training programs, compliance programs, and supervision processes. Additional\ninformation concerning these risks and our management of them, all of which is incorporated into this Item 1A by this reference, appears under the captions \u201cOperational Risk Management\u201d and \u201cCompliance Risk Management,\u201d beginning on pages 56 and 57, respectively, of the Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of our 2017 Annual Report, which is part of the material from that report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of this report.\nRegulatory, Legislative, and Legal Risks\nThe regulatory environment is challenging. We operate in a heavily regulated industry. The regulatory environment changed significantly as a result of Dodd-Frank. Our regulatory burdens, including both operating restrictions and ongoing compliance costs, are substantial.\nWe are subject to many banking, deposit, insurance, securities brokerage and underwriting, and consumer lending regulations in addition to the rules applicable to all companies publicly traded in the U.S. securities markets and, in particular, on the New York Stock Exchange. Failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in financial, structural, and operational penalties. In addition, efforts to comply with applicable regulations may increase our costs\nand/or limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities. See \u201cSupervision and Regulation\u201d in Item 1 of this report, beginning on page 6, for additional information concerning financial industry regulations. Federal and state regulations significantly limit the types of activities in which we, as a financial institution, may engage. In addition, we are subject to a wide array of other regulations that govern other aspects of how we conduct our business, such as in the areas of employment and intellectual property. Federal and state legislative and regulatory authorities increasingly consider changing these regulations or adopting new ones. Such actions could further limit the amount of interest or fees we can charge, could further restrict our ability to collect loans or realize on\ncollateral, could affect the terms or profitability of the products and services we offer, or could materially affect us in other ways. Additional federal and state consumer protection regulations also could expand the privacy protections afforded to customers of financial institutions, restricting our ability to share or receive customer information and increasing our costs.\nThe following paragraphs highlight certain specific important risk areas related to regulatory matters currently. These paragraphs do not describe these risks exhaustively, and they do not describe all such risks that we face currently. Moreover, the importance of specific risks will grow or diminish as circumstances change.\nWe and our Bank both are required to maintain certain regulatory capital levels and ratios. In 2013 regulators adopted enhancements to U.S. capital standards based on international standards known as \u201cBasel III.\u201d They are discussed in Item 1 of this report, in tabular and narrative form, under the caption \u201cCapital Adequacy\u201d starting on page 8.\nPressures to maintain appropriate capital levels and address business needs in the current economy may lead to actions that could be dilutive or otherwise adverse to our shareholders. Such actions could include: reduction or elimination of dividends; the issuance of common or preferred stock, or securities convertible into stock; or the issuance of any class of stock having rights that are adverse to those of the holders of our existing classes of common or preferred stock.\nAdditional information concerning these risks and our management of them, all of which is incorporated into this Item 1A by this reference, appears: under the captions \u201cCapital Adequacy\u201d and \u201cPrompt Corrective Action (PCA)\u201d in Item 1 of this report beginning on pages 8 and 9, respectively; under the captions \u201cCapital-2017 Compared to 2016,\u201d \u201cCapital Management and Adequacy,\u201d and \u201cMarket Uncertainties and Prospective Trends\u201d beginning on pages 26, 56, and 66, respectively, of the Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of our 2017 Annual Report, which is part of the material from that report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of this report; and under the caption \u201cRegulatory Capital\u201d in Note 12-Regulatory Capital and Restrictions, beginning on page 131 of our 2017 Annual Report, which is part of the material from that report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 8 of this report.\nWe are required to conduct and submit annual stress tests, the outcomes of which could further increase our capital requirements and could\ndamage our reputation and our ability to obtain credit. Stress testing processes require banks to estimate the impact on capital, liquidity, and other measures of safety of certain assumed environmental shocks. A failure to satisfy regulatory stress testing, or another significant risk management standard, could result in the imposition of operating restrictions on us and require us to raise capital, which could adversely affect operating results or be dilutive to our shareholders. In addition, a summary of a portion of the stress results must be made public. A poor result could impact our reputation generally and our ability to borrow funds.\nStress-testing may create unintended adverse incentives which may promote counter-productive tactics. Stress testing includes \u201crate shocks\u201d which model the financial impact of sudden large increases in market interest rates upon us. In practical effect this encourages banks to shorten the \u201cduration\u201d of their assets (loans and investments), discouraging long-term assets. Shortening duration should improve a bank\u2019s ability to withstand a very large rate shock. However, it also can reduce the effective yield a bank receives from its assets, which would put downward pressure on revenues, margins, and earnings.\nLegal disputes are an unavoidable part of business, and the outcome of pending or threatened litigation cannot be predicted with any certainty. We face the risk of litigation from customers, employees, vendors, contractual parties, and other persons, either singly or in class actions, and from federal or state regulators. We manage those risks through internal controls, personnel training, insurance, litigation management, our compliance and ethics processes, and other means. However, the commencement, outcome, and magnitude of litigation cannot be predicted or controlled with any certainty.\nTypically we are unable to estimate our loss exposure from claims against us until relatively late in the litigation process, which can make our financial recognition of loss from litigation unpredictable and highly uneven from one period to the next. Currently we are defending a number of legal matters. For most of them we have established either no accrual (reserve) or no significant reserve. Financial accounting guidance requires that litigation loss be both estimable and probable before a reserve may be established (recorded as a liability on our balance sheet). For most litigation matters, under that guidance reserves typically are not established until after preliminary motions to dismiss or narrow the case are resolved, after discovery is substantially in process, and (in many cases) after preliminary overtures regarding settlement have occurred. Potentially significant cases often are pending for years before any loss is recognized and a reserve is established. Moreover, it is\nnot uncommon for a case to experience relatively little progress toward resolution for a long period followed by a brief period of rapid development. Lastly, although most cases are resolved with little or no loss to us, for the others loss typically is recognized either all at once (near the time of resolution) or very unevenly over the life of the case.\nAdditional information concerning litigation risks and our management of them, all of which is incorporated into this Item 1A by this reference, appears: under the caption \u201cLegacy Mortgage Business Risks\u201d beginning on page 21 of this report; under the captions \u201cRepurchase Obligations, Off-Balance Sheet\nArrangements, and Other Contractual Obligations,\u201d \u201cRepurchase and Foreclosure Liability,\u201d \u201cMarket Uncertainties and Prospective Trends,\u201d and \u201cContingent Liabilities\u201d beginning on pages 61, 65, 66, and 70, respectively, of the Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of our 2017 Annual Report, which is part of the material from that report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of this report; and under the caption \u201cContingencies\u201d in Note 17-Contingencies and Other Disclosures, beginning on page 140 of our 2017 Annual Report, which is part of the material from that report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 8 of this report.\nRisks of Expense Control\nOur ability to successfully manage expenses is important to our long-term survival and prosperity but in part is subject to risks beyond our control. Many factors can influence the amount of our expenses, as well as how quickly they grow. As our businesses change, either by expansion or contraction, additional expenses can arise from asset purchases, structural reorganization, evolving business strategies, and changing regulations, among other things. The importance of managing expenses has been amplified in the recent slow growth, low net interest margin business environment. In the past five years our noninterest expense generally has grown less quickly than our assets and revenues. However, noninterest expense has been made more volatile year-to-year, and especially quarter-to-quarter, by idiosyncratic charges related to legacy mortgage activities as discussed in this Item 1A under the caption \u201cLegacy Mortgage Business Risks\u201d beginning on page 21. Noninterest expense in 2017 deviated from our recent trend, primarily due to expenses related to strategic acquisitions and tax reform legislation.\nWe manage controllable expenses and risk through a variety of means, including selectively outsourcing or multi-sourcing various functions and procurement coordination and processes. In recent years we have actively sought to make strategic businesses more\nefficient primarily by investing in technology, re-thinking and right-sizing our physical facilities, and re-thinking and right-sizing our workforce and incentive programs. These efforts usually entail additional near-term expenses in the form of technology purchases and implementation, facility closure or renovation costs, and severance costs, while expected benefits typically are realized with some uncertainty in the future.\nWe have also re-focused our attention on the economic profit generated by our business activities and prospects rather than merely revenues or ordinary profit. Economic profit analysis attempts to relate ordinary profit to the capital employed to create that profit with the goal of achieving higher (more efficient) returns on capital employed overall. Activities with higher capital usage bear a greater burden in economic profit analysis. The process is intended to allow us to more efficiently manage investment of our resources. Economic profit analysis involves significant judgment regarding capital allocation. Mistakes in those judgments could result in a misallocation of resources and diminished profitability over the long run.\nDespite our efforts, our costs could rise due to adverse structural changes or market shifts. For example, the overall cost of our health insurance benefit is highly dependent upon regulatory factors and market forces beyond our control.\nGeographic Risks\nWe are subject to risks of operating in various jurisdictions. To a significant degree our banking business is exposed to economic, regulatory, natural disaster, and other risks that primarily impact Tennessee and neighboring states where we do our traditional banking business. If the southeastern U.S. were to experience adversity not shared by other parts\nof the country, we are likely to experience adversity to a degree not shared by those competitors which have a broader or different regional footprint. Examples of these kinds of risks include: earthquakes in Memphis; hurricanes in south Florida or coastal Texas; a major change in health insurance laws impacting the many\nhealthcare companies in middle Tennessee; and automotive industry plant closures.\nWe have international assets in the form of loans and letters of credit. Holding non-U.S. assets creates a number of risks: the risk that taxes, fees, prohibitions, and other barriers and constraints may be created or increased by the U.S. or other countries that would impact our holdings; the risk that currency exchange rates could move unfavorably so as to diminish the U.S. dollar value of assets, or to enlarge the U.S. dollar\nvalue of liabilities; and the risk that legal recourse against foreign counterparties may be limited in unexpected ways. Our ability to manage those and other risks depends upon a number of factors, including: our ability to recognize and anticipate differences in legal, cultural, and other expectations applicable to customers, regulators, vendors, and other business partners and counterparties; and our ability to recognize and manage any exchange rate risks to which we are exposed.\nInsurance\nOur property and casualty insurance may not cover or may be inadequate to cover the risks that we face, and we are or may be adversely affected by a default by the insurers that provide us mortgage and bank-owned life insurance. We use insurance to manage a number of risks, including damage or destruction of property as well as legal and other liability. Not all such risks are insured, in any given insured situation our insurance may be inadequate to cover all loss, and many risks we face are uninsurable. For those risks that are insured, we also face the risks that the insurer may default on its obligations or that the insurer may refuse to honor them. We treat the former risk as a type of credit risk, which we manage by reviewing the insurers that we use and by striving to use more than one insurer when practical. The risk of refusal, whether due to honest disagreement or bad faith, is inherent in any contractual situation.\nA portion of our consumer loan portfolio involves mortgage default insurance. If a default insurer were to experience a significant credit downgrade or were to become insolvent, that could adversely affect the carrying value of loans insured by that company, which could result in an immediate increase in our loan loss provision or write-down of the carrying value of those loans on our balance sheet and, in either case, a corresponding impact on our financial results. If many default insurers were to experience downgrades or\ninsolvency at the same time, the risk of a financial impact would be amplified.\nWe own certain bank-owned life insurance policies as assets on our books. Some of those policies are \u201cgeneral account\u201d and others are \u201cseparate account.\u201d The general account policies are subject to the risk that the carrier might experience a significant downgrade or become insolvent. The separate account policies are less susceptible to carrier risk, but do carry a higher risk of value fluctuations in securities which underlie those policies. Both risks are managed through periodic reviews of the carriers and the underlying security values. However, particularly for the general account policies, our ability to liquidate a policy in anticipation of an adverse carrier event is significantly limited by applicable insurance contracts and regulations as well as by a substantial tax penalty which could be levied upon early policy termination.\nWhen we self-insure certain exposures, our estimates of future expenditures may be inadequate for actual expenditures that occur. For example, we self-insure our employee health-insurance benefit program. We estimate future expenditures and establish accruals (reserves) based on the estimates. If actual expenditures were to exceed our estimates in a future period, our future expenses could be adversely and unexpectedly increased.\nLiquidity and Funding Risks\nLiquidity is essential to our business model and a lack of liquidity or an increase in the cost of liquidity may materially and adversely affect our businesses, results of operations, financial conditions and cash flows. In general, the costs of our funding directly impact our costs of doing business and, therefore, can positively or negatively affect our financial results. Our funding requirements in 2017 were met principally by deposits, by financing from\nother financial institutions, and by funds obtained from the capital markets.\nDeposits traditionally have provided our most affordable funds and by far the largest portion of funding. However, deposit trends can shift with economic conditions. As the economy improves and market rates rise, deposit levels in our Bank might fall, perhaps fairly quickly if a tipping point is reached, as depositors become more comfortable with risk and seek higher returns in other vehicles. This could\npressure us to raise our deposit rates, which could shrink our net interest margin if loan rates do not rise correspondingly.\nThe market among banks for deposits may be impacted by the Basel III capital rules. Those rules generally provide favorable treatment for core deposits. Moreover, institutions with more than $50 billion of assets are required to maintain a minimum Liquidity Coverage ratio. Larger banks covered by this rule may be incented to compete for core deposits vigorously. Although mid-sized banks, like ours, are not directly impacted by this rule, if some large banks in our markets take aggressive actions we could lose deposit share or be compelled to adjust our deposit pricing and practices in ways that could increase our costs.\nWe also depend upon financing from private institutional or other investors by means of the capital markets. In 2014 we issued $400 million of senior Bank notes due 2019, and in 2015 we issued $500 million of senior holding-company notes due 2020. The 2015 notes refinanced an earlier five-year notes issue. Presently we believe we could access the capital markets again if we desired to do so. Risk remains, however, that capital markets may become unavailable to us for reasons beyond our control.\nA number of more general factors could make funding more difficult, more expensive, or unavailable on affordable terms, including, but not limited to, our financial results, organizational or political changes, adverse impacts on our reputation, changes in the\nactivities of our business partners, disruptions in the capital markets, specific events that adversely impact the financial services industry, counterparty availability, changes affecting our loan portfolio or other assets, changes affecting our corporate and regulatory structure, interest rate fluctuations, ratings agency actions, general economic conditions, and the legal, regulatory, accounting, and tax environments governing our funding transactions. In addition, our ability to raise funds is strongly affected by the general state of the U.S. and world economies and financial markets as well as the policies and capabilities of the U.S. government and its agencies, and may remain or become increasingly difficult due to economic and other factors beyond our control.\nUncertainties about the future of LIBOR and other benchmark rates may impact our costs and our ability to manage our assets and liabilities to maintain our net interest margin. In 2017 international proposals were made to change, or no longer officially use, certain benchmark interest rates to which many loans and securities are linked. We cannot predict how or when LIBOR and other benchmarks may change nor the impact such changes may have on us, our customers, or the market for our notes or preferred stock.\nEvents affecting interest rates, markets, and other factors may adversely affect the demand for our products and services in our fixed income business. As a result, disruptions in those areas may adversely impact our earnings in that business unit.\nCredit Ratings\nOur credit ratings directly affect the availability and cost of our unsecured funding. FHN and the Bank currently receive ratings from several rating agencies for unsecured borrowings. A rating below investment grade typically reduces availability and increases the cost of market-based funding. A debt rating of Baa3 or higher by Moody\u2019s Investors Service, or BBB- or higher by Fitch Ratings, is considered investment grade for many purposes. At December 31, 2017, both rating agencies rated the unsecured senior debt of FHN and of the Bank as investment grade. The ratings outlook from Fitch was positive, and stable from Moody\u2019s for both FHN and the Bank. To the extent that in the future we depend on institutional borrowing and the capital markets for funding and capital, we could experience reduced liquidity and increased cost of unsecured funding if our debt ratings were lowered further, particularly if lowered below investment grade. In addition, other actions by ratings agencies can create uncertainty about our ratings in the future and thus can adversely affect the cost and\navailability of funding, including placing us on negative outlook or on watchlist. Please note that a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities, is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time, and should be evaluated independently of any other rating.\nReductions in our credit ratings could result in counterparties reducing or terminating their relationships with us. Some parties with whom we do business may have internal policies restricting the business that can be done with financial institutions, such as the Bank, that have credit ratings lower than a certain threshold.\nReductions in our credit ratings could allow counterparties to terminate and immediately force us to settle certain derivatives agreements, and could force us to provide additional collateral with respect to certain derivatives agreements. At this time, those of our ISDA master agreements which have ratings triggers reference the lower of Standard & Poor\u2019s Financial Services LLC or\nMoody\u2019s ratings. Based on those ratings, for some time we have been required to post collateral in the amount of our derivative liability positions with most derivative counterparties. Should a credit rating\ndowngrade occur, the maximum additional collateral we would have been required to post is approximately $1 million as of December 31, 2017.\nInterest Rate and Yield Curve Risks\nWe are subject to interest rate risk because a significant portion of our business involves borrowing and lending money, and investing in financial instruments. A significant portion of our funding comes from short-term and demand deposits, while a significant portion of our lending and investing is in medium-term and long-term instruments. Changes in interest rates directly impact our revenues and expenses, and could expand or compress our net interest margin. We actively manage our balance sheet to control the risks of a reduction in net interest margin brought about by ordinary fluctuations in rates.\nA flat or inverted yield curve may reduce our net interest margin and adversely affect our lending and fixed income businesses. The yield curve simply shows the interest rates applicable to short and long term debt. The curve is steep when short-term rates are much lower than long-term rates; it is flat when short-term rates are nearly equal to long-term rates; and it is inverted when short-term rates exceed long-term rates. Historically, the yield curve usually is positively sloped. However, the yield curve can be relatively flat or inverted. A flat or inverted yield curve tends to decrease net interest margin, which would adversely impact our lending businesses, and it tends to reduce demand for long-term debt securities, which would adversely impact the revenues of our fixed income business.\nWe may be in a transitional period, from a low-rate environment to one with more normal, or at least somewhat higher, rates. The yield curve eventually may steepen, though at least in the short term it has tended to flatten as short-term rates have risen somewhat faster than long-term ones. With higher rates and (eventually) a steeper yield curve, the new environment eventually should be positive for us, overall. However, some effects may be negative and the timing of various effects will be uneven. Examples include: (i) rising rates may create transitory\nbut significant outflows of deposits, which in turn could necessitate additional (and more costly) borrowing or raising deposit rates more quickly than anticipated; (ii) rising rates are likely to dampen consumer demand for mortgages, which could quickly reduce demand for our mortgage warehouse lending products; (iii) mortgage demand may change unevenly, with a brief uptick (to lock in still-low rates) followed by a more pronounced down-trend; and (iv) long-term rate changes may continue to lag short-term changes due to external factors such as high foreign demand for U.S. dollar fixed income securities.\nAlthough our overall balance sheet remains asset-sensitive, we have partially moderated that sensitivity, which would somewhat diminish the benefits we otherwise would realize from a general rise in interest rates. Our asset-liability management has positioned our balance sheet to be \u201casset-sensitive.\u201d As such, a general rise in rates should benefit us if, as we expect, the deposit and other rates we pay tend to rise more slowly than the rates we charge or receive on our assets. We believe an asset sensitive balance sheet remains appropriate. However, as short-term rates continue to rise from near zero, the risk of a future lowering of interest rates becomes more significant. The acquisition of Capital Bank has moderated our asset sensitivity slightly, which will somewhat diminish the benefits we otherwise would have realized from a general rise in interest rates. We believe an asset sensitive balance sheet remains appropriate, as we balance the market\u2019s expectations for further rate increases against our exposure to, and the likelihood of, falling interest rates.\nExpectations by the market regarding the direction of future interest rate movements can impact the demand for fixed income investments which in turn can impact the revenues of our fixed income business. That risk is most apparent during times when strong expectations have not yet been reflected in market rates, or when expectations are especially weak or uncertain.\nAsset Inventories and Market Risks\nThe trading securities inventories and loans held for sale in our fixed income business are subject to market and credit risks. In the course of that business we hold trading securities inventory and loan positions for purposes of distribution to customers, and we are exposed to certain market risks attributable principally\nto credit risk and interest rate risk associated with these assets. We manage the risks of holding inventories of securities and loans through certain market risk management policies and procedures, including, for example, hedging activities and Value-at-Risk (\u201cVaR\u201d) limits, trading policies, modeling, and stress analyses.\nAverage fixed income trading securities (long positions) were $1.2 billion for 2017, $1.2 billion for 2016, and $1.3 billion for 2015. Average fixed income trading liabilities (short positions) were $.8 billion, $.8 billion, $.7 billion for 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. Average loans held for sale in our fixed income business were $.3 billion for 2017, and were insignificant for earlier years. Additional information concerning these risks and our management of them, all of which is incorporated into this Item 1A by this reference, appears under the caption \u201cMarket Risk Management\u201d beginning on page 53 of the Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of our 2017 Annual Report, which is part of the material from that Report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of this report.\nDeclines, disruptions, or precipitous changes in markets or market prices can adversely affect our fees and other income sources. We earn fees and other income related to our brokerage business and our management of assets for customers. Declines, disruptions, or precipitous changes in markets or market prices can adversely affect those revenue sources.\nSignificant changes to the securities market\u2019s performance can have a material impact upon our assets, liabilities, and financial results. We have a number of assets and obligations that are linked, directly or indirectly, to major securities markets. Significant changes in market performance can have a material impact upon our assets, liabilities, and financial results.\nAn example of that linkage is our obligation to fund our pension plan so that it may satisfy benefit claims in the future. Our pension funding obligations generally depend upon actuarial estimates of benefits claims, the discount rate used to estimate the present values of those claims, and estimates of plan asset values. Our obligations to fund the plan can be affected by changes in any of those three factors. Accordingly, our obligations diminish if the plan\u2019s investments perform better than expectations or if estimates are changed anticipating better performance, and can grow if those\ninvestments perform poorly or if expectations worsen. A rise in interest rates is likely to negatively impact the values of fixed income assets held in the plan, but could also result in an increase in the discount rate used to measure the present value of future benefit payments. Similarly, our obligations can be impacted by changes in mortality tables or other actuarial inputs. We manage the risk of rate changes by investing plan assets in fixed income securities having maturities aligned with the expected timing of payouts. Because there are no new participants, the actuarial-input risk should diminish over time, although very slowly.\nChanges in our funding obligation generally translate into positive or negative changes in our pension expense over time, which in turn affects our financial performance. Our obligations and expenses relative to the plan can be affected by many other things, including changes in our participating employee population and changes to the plan itself. Although we have taken actions intended to moderate future volatility in this area, risk of some level of volatility is unavoidable.\nOur hedging activities may be ineffective, may not adequately hedge our risks, and are subject to credit risk. In the normal course of our businesses we attempt to create partial or full economic hedges of various, though not all, financial risks. For example: our fixed income unit manages interest rate risk on a portion of its trading portfolio with short positions, futures, and options contracts; and, we use derivatives, including swaps, swaptions, caps, forward contracts, options, and collars, that are designed to moderate the impact on earnings as interest rates change. Generally, in the latter example these hedged items include certain term borrowings and certain held-to-maturity loans.\nHedging creates certain risks for us, including the risk that the other party to the hedge transaction will fail to perform (counterparty risk, which is a type of credit risk), and the risk that the hedge will not fully protect us from loss as intended (hedge failure risk). Unexpected counterparty failure or hedge failure could have a significant adverse effect on our liquidity and earnings.\nAccounting & Tax Risks\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make significant estimates that affect the financial statements. The estimate that is consistently one of our most critical is the level of the allowance for credit losses. However, other estimates can be highly significant at discrete times or during\nperiods of varying length. Currently those include: the level of reserves for loan repurchase, make-whole, and foreclosure losses; the valuation of our deferred tax assets; and the valuation of our goodwill. Estimates are made at specific points in time; as actual events unfold, estimates are adjusted accordingly. Due to the inherent nature of these estimates, it is possible that, at some time in the future, we may significantly increase the\nallowance for credit losses and/or sustain credit losses that are significantly higher than the provided allowance, or we may recognize a significant provision for impairment of our goodwill or other assets, or we may make some other adjustment that will differ materially from the estimates that we make today. Moreover, in some cases, especially concerning litigation and other contingency matters where critical information is inadequate, we are unable to make estimates until fairly late in a lengthy process.\nWe lack first-hand visibility regarding certain loans, other assets, or liabilities which increases the risk that our estimates may be inaccurate. For example, interagency supervisory guidance related to practices for loans and lines of credit secured by junior liens on 1-4 family residential properties requires that the performance of the first lien should be considered when assessing the collectability and inherent loss of a performing junior lien. Additionally, the OCC has clarified that an institution\u2019s income recognition policy should incorporate management\u2019s consideration of all reasonably available information including, for junior liens, the performance of the associated senior liens as well as trends in other credit quality indicators. We own and service a consumer real estate portfolio that is primarily composed of home equity lines and installment loans. As of December 31, 2017, that amount was $6.4 billion. As of December 31, 2017, approximately $1.4 billion, or 21%, of the consumer real estate portfolio consisted of stand-alone second liens while $.2 billion, or 3%, were second liens whose first liens are owned or serviced by FHN. We are not able to actively monitor the performance status of the first liens that are serviced by others. We obtain first lien performance information from third parties and through loss mitigation activities, and we place a stand-alone second lien loan on nonaccrual if we discover that there are performance issues with the first lien loan. It is possible that if our evaluation methods change or information sources otherwise improve our additions to nonperforming loans may be material.\nChanges in accounting rules can significantly affect how we record and report assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and earnings. Although such changes generally affect all companies in a given industry, in practice changes sometimes have a disparate impact due to differences in the circumstances or business operations of companies within the same industry.\nOne such pending accounting change, ASU 2016-13, \u201cMeasurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,\u201d substantially revises the measurement and recognition of credit losses for certain assets, including most loans, in a manner that could substantially and adversely change when and how we recognize loan loss. Under ASU 2016-13, when we make a new loan that is covered by the standard, we\nwill be required to recognize immediately the \u201ccurrent expected credit loss,\u201d or \u201cCECL,\u201d of that loan. We will also re-evaluate CECL each quarter the loan is outstanding. CECL is the difference between our cost and the net amount we expect to collect over the life of the loan using certain estimation methods and our experience with other, similar loans. In contrast, the current accounting standard delays recognition of credit loss until loss is \u201cprobable\u201d (very likely). As a result, once we adopt ASU 2016-13 and the CECL accounting process (expected for 2020), recognition of estimated credit loss will be significantly accelerated compared to current practice. This change potentially could: result in a significant increase, especially at the time of adoption but also during any period of loan growth, in our loan loss provision (expense) and allowance (reserve); through the increased provision, adversely impact our earnings and, correspondingly, our regulatory capital levels; and, enhance volatility in loan loss provision and allowance levels from quarter to quarter and year to year, especially during times when the economy is in transition.\nChanges in regulatory rules can create significant accounting impacts for us. Because we operate in a regulated industry we prepare regulatory financial reports based on regulatory accounting rules. Changes in those rules can have significant impacts upon us in terms of regulatory compliance. In addition, such changes can impact our ordinary financial reporting, and uncertainties related to regulatory changes can create uncertainties in our financial reporting.\nA reduction in our taxable earnings outlook, reduction in our income tax rate, or both could adversely affect the value of our deferred tax asset. At December 31, 2017 our gross deferred tax asset after valuation allowance was approximately $330.6 million. The value of our deferred tax asset depends in part upon our estimation of our ability to realize the asset during applicable future periods and upon our estimate of our effective tax rate.\nChanges in income tax rates applicable to us can positively or adversely affect the value of our deferred tax asset suddenly. Increases in rates tend to make our deferred tax assets (\u201cDTA\u201d) more valuable, while decreases tend to reduce value. As an example, in response to corporate tax rate cuts enacted late in 2017, we recognized an $82.0 million charge against fourth quarter earnings, a substantial majority of which related to DTA valuation adjustments.\nTax Reform Law Risks\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201cTax Reform Law\u201d), enacted late in 2017, creates the potential for significant operating benefits for us in the long term, but also creates the potential for certain risks. In most cases the actual effects of the Law will not be known for some time.\nAn immediate impact to us of the Tax Reform Law\u2019s reduction in the corporate income tax rate was a substantial charge to earnings in the fourth quarter of 2017, primarily to reflect estimated loss in value of our deferred tax assets. These assets generally represent tax deductions we anticipate taking in the future. The value of any future deduction\ndepends heavily upon the tax rate expected to apply in the future.\nThe Tax Reform Law restricts our ability to deduct FDIC premiums, which effectively increases the cost of this expense. If later we exceed $50 billion in asset size, we will not be able to deduct FDIC premiums at all.\nThe Tax Reform Law limits the ability of a business to deduct net business interest expense. For many businesses, this provision will make the costs of borrowing higher, and therefore could tend to discourage borrowing, especially in those sectors which rely heavily on borrowed capital.\nThe Tax Reform Law may reduce an individual\u2019s ability to deduct home mortgage interest and property taxes. This provision could tend to weaken demand for home mortgage and home equity loans by making the practical costs higher, and for similar\nreasons could adversely affect home values. Those impacts may be higher in high-price, high-income markets and lower in other markets.\nRisks of Holding our Stock\nThe principal source of cash flow to pay dividends on our stock, as well as service our debt, is dividends and distributions from the Bank, and the Bank cannot currently pay dividends to us without regulatory approval. We primarily depend upon common dividends from the Bank for cash to fund dividends we pay to our common and preferred stockholders, and to service our outstanding debt. Regulatory constraints may prevent the Bank from declaring and paying dividends to us in 2018 without regulatory approval. Applying the applicable regulatory rules, as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Bank had negative $156.7 million and negative $132.5 million, respectively, available for dividends. At January 1, 2018, under those rules, the Bank could legally declare cash dividends on the Bank\u2019s common or preferred stock of approximately $51.1 million without obtaining regulatory approval. That amount will improve during 2018 only to the extent that the Bank\u2019s earnings for the year exceed preferred and any common dividends for the year.\nAlso, we are required to provide financial support to the Bank. Accordingly, at any given time a portion of our funds may have to be used for that purpose and therefore would be unavailable for dividends.\nFurthermore, the Federal Reserve and the OCC have issued policy statements generally requiring insured banks and bank holding companies only to pay dividends out of current operating earnings. The Federal Reserve has released a supervisory letter advising bank holding companies, among other things, that as a general matter a bank holding company should inform the Federal Reserve and should eliminate, defer or significantly reduce its dividends if (i) the bank\nholding company\u2019s net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends; (ii) the bank holding company\u2019s prospective rate of earnings is not consistent with the bank holding company\u2019s capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition; or (iii) the bank holding company will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios.\nOur stockholders may suffer dilution if we raise capital through public or private equity financings to fund our operations, to increase our capital, or to expand. If we raise funds by issuing equity securities or instruments that are convertible into equity securities, the percentage ownership of our current common stockholders will be reduced, the new equity securities may have rights and preferences superior to those of our common or outstanding preferred stock, and additional issuances could be at a sales price which is dilutive to current stockholders. We may also issue equity securities directly as consideration for acquisitions we may make that could be dilutive to stockholders.\nProvisions of Tennessee law, and certain provisions of our charter and bylaws, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us or could have the effect of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire control of us. These provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if an acquisition might be at a price attractive to many of our stockholders.", "PERMNO": 36397, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "FHN"}
