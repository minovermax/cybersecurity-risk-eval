{"cik": "882104", "company": "PDL BIOPHARMA, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-11", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider and evaluate all of the information included and incorporated by reference in this Annual Report, including the risk factors listed below. Any of these risks, as well as other risks and uncertainties, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, which in turn could materially and adversely affect the trading price of shares of our common stock. Additional risks not currently known or currently material to us may also harm our business.\nWe are exploring and evaluating potential transactions pursuant to our monetization strategy and plan of complete liquidation and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying or completing any potential transaction or otherwise providing value to our stockholders or successfully implementing the strategy, that any such potential transactions will yield significant value for stockholders or that the process will not have an adverse impact on our business.\nIn September 2019, in an effort to enhance stockholder value, we commenced a review of strategic alternatives, including a possible sale or liquidation of our company. In December 2019, we announced that we had completed the strategic review process that we had initiated in September 2019 and that, as a result, we had decided to halt the execution of its growth strategy, cease additional strategic investments and pursue a formal process that is intended to unlock value by monetizing the Company\u2019s assets and returning any available net proceeds to stockholders. We further announced in December 2019 that we would explore a variety of potential transactions in connection with such monetization strategy, including a sale of our company, divestiture of our assets or businesses, a spin-off transaction, a merger or a combination thereof. In February of 2020, the board of directors approved, consistent with our monetization strategy, a plan of complete liquidation and passed a resolution to seek stockholder approval to dissolve the Company under Delaware law at its next annual stockholder meeting. However, there can be no assurance that the exploration of one or more potential monetization transactions will result in the identification or consummation of any transaction, the period of time it will take to effect the strategy, or that we will be successful in implementing the strategy.\nThe success of our strategy will depend on our ability to identify and complete one or more transactions that will capture value for our assets, and on numerous other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Such factors include market conditions, industry trends, the interest of third parties in our business and assets and the availability of financing to potential buyers. Our stock price or the value of net proceeds we are able to generate from the monetization process may be adversely affected if the process is delayed, does not result in one or more successful transactions or if we are not able to execute the strategy. Even if one or more transactions are completed, there can be no assurance that they will have a positive effect on stockholder value. Our board of directors may determine to modify, amend or terminate the strategy at any time. If our board of directors were to so determine, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and we would need to continue to operate our business and seek to grow it and create stockholder value.\nIn addition, our financial results and operations may be adversely affected by our monetization strategy and by the uncertainty regarding its outcome. Management and our board of directors have been and will continue to focus on our monetization strategy as well as on the continued operations of our business until such time, if any, that the monetization strategy has been successfully executed or abandoned. Additionally, we have directed capital resources to the strategy that otherwise could have been used in our business operations, and we expect to continue to do so until the process is completed or a determination is made that we will no longer pursue the strategy. We expect to incur substantial expenses associated with identifying and evaluating potential transactions, including those related to employee retention payments, equity compensation, severance pay, directors and officers insurance, taxes, and legal, accounting and financial advisory fees. The process of exploring potential transactions is expected to be time consuming and disruptive to our current business operations and, if we are unable to effectively manage the process, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nFurthermore, speculation regarding any developments related to the review of strategic alternatives and perceived uncertainties related to the implementation of the monetization strategy could cause our stock price to fluctuate significantly.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully implement our monetization strategy or that any transaction we may enter into pursuant to the strategy would yield significant value for our stockholders. We also cannot assure you that any potential transaction or other strategic alternative, if identified, evaluated and consummated, will provide greater value to our stockholders than that reflected in the current stock price.\nOur efforts to enhance stockholder value through our monetization strategy may not be successful.\nWe cannot assure you that our efforts to enhance stockholder value through the conduct of our monetization strategy will succeed. There will be risks associated with any potential divestiture transaction, including whether we will attract potential acquirers for\nthe Company, its assets or its businesses, and whether offers made by such potential acquirors, if any, will be at valuations that we deem reasonable. Moreover, we are not able to predict how long it will take to implement our monetization strategy. The timing and terms of any transaction will depend on a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. A delay in, or failure to complete, any such transaction could have a material effect on our stock price and the amount of any potential distributions to our stockholders.\nIf we were to pursue a plan of dissolution, there can be no assurance as to the amount, if any, of cash or other property that could be distributed to our stockholders or the timing of any such future distribution.\nAssuming successful implementation of our monetization strategy and plan of complete liquidation, and an inability to sell the Company as a whole, together with all or less than all of its assets, we expect to pursue a plan of dissolution as the most effective mechanism for wind-down of the Company and resolution of outstanding claims. If such a plan of dissolution were to be approved by our stockholders, once implemented through the filing of a Certificate of Dissolution and in accordance with Delaware law, known liabilities would be paid or provided for, reserves would be established for contingent known and unknown liabilities and any remaining assets would be monetized with net proceeds ultimately distributed to stockholders. The period for claimants to file claims against the Company following the filing of a Certificate of Dissolution is set at three years by Delaware statute. However, to the extent the Company is subject to pending litigation, the Company would potentially continue its existence through the claims resolution process beyond the three-year period, with attendant expenses, until such litigation is resolved. After the filing of a Certificate of Dissolution, it is possible that remaining assets not sold during the pre-dissolution period would be monetized and net proceeds ultimately distributed, subject to the claims resolution process. We expect that we would have limited or no new revenue generation sources or activities and that we would not engage in further business activities following the adoption of a dissolution plan and the filing of a Certificate of Dissolution except for winding up our business, selling or disposing of any of our remaining saleable assets, satisfying and providing for our liabilities and claims, and distributing net proceeds to stockholders. The amount and timing of any distributions to stockholders would be determined by our board of directors (or the trustee of a liquidating trust if our assets and liabilities are transferred to a liquidating trust pursuant to a plan of liquidation and dissolution), in its sole discretion, and would depend, in part, on our ability to settle or otherwise resolve and provide for all of our remaining liabilities and contingencies and convert any remaining assets into cash. In addition, after the filing of a Certificate of Dissolution, the Company expects to follow a process which will involve appearances before the Delaware courts to obtain the court\u2019s confirmation that stockholder distributions are in compliance with Delaware law, including whether the Company has set aside sufficient funds as a reserve for claims, and these proceedings may delay or limit such post-dissolution distributions. If we pursue liquidation and dissolution, uncertainties as to the amount of our liabilities and the disposition value, if any, of our remaining assets make it impractical to predict the net value which might ultimately be distributable to our stockholders. No assurance can be given that available cash and any amounts received on any sale of assets will be adequate to provide for our obligations, liabilities, expenses and claims and to make cash distributions to stockholders. We also cannot assure you that the value of any distribution in liquidation would equal the price or prices at which our common stock has recently traded or may trade in the future.\nWe cannot predict the timing, amount or mechanics of any potential distributions to our stockholders.\nMany unknown variables will affect the amount, timing and mechanics of any potential distributions to stockholders. Factors that could have a material effect on the amount of any potential future distributions include, but are not limited to, decreases in the purchase price that third parties are willing to pay for our assets, a failure to sell our assets, the amount of assets and corporate wind-down related operating and other expenses, the Company\u2019s tax treatment, any required reserves to address potential liabilities, including retained and contingent liabilities (including, but not limited to those arising from any sales of the Company\u2019s assets), and/or other unforeseen events. These and other factors, such as the procedures established under Delaware law for the dissolution of a corporation, could also delay the timing of any potential distributions.\nA delay in the sales of our assets is likely to decrease the funds available for distribution to stockholders.\nPotential liabilities and expenses from operations (including, but not limited to operating costs such as salaries, directors\u2019 fees, directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance, federal and state income taxes, payroll and local taxes, legal, investment banking, consulting and accounting fees and miscellaneous office expenses) will continue to be incurred by us as we seek to sell our assets and wind-down our operations. In the event that any sales of our assets are delayed, we may incur additional liabilities and expenses from operations, that will reduce the net funds ultimately available for distribution to our stockholders.\nFocus on our monetization strategy could materially and adversely affect our existing operating businesses.\nUntil such time, if any, as we are able to successfully implement our monetization strategy, we are subject to operational risks related to our existing business. As a result of our monetization strategy, our management\u2019s focus and attention on such efforts may be diverted, which could cause disruption of our ongoing business or inconsistencies in standards and controls that could negatively affect our ability to maintain third-party relationships. Moreover, we do not anticipate raising additional capital, which could result in a shortfall in our cash resources that would limit our ability to operate our business profitably, and could otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. Management will be required to devote sufficient attention to both the monetization strategy and continued development of our businesses until the strategy is fully executed.\nOur revenues from our Pharmaceutical segment consist entirely of sales of the Noden Products, and our revenues from our Medical Devices segment consist entirely of sales and leasing of the LENSAR Laser System. The success of Noden is dependent upon the success of the prescription pharmaceutical products sold under the brand names Tekturna, Tekturna HCT, Rasilez and Rasilez HCT, and there can be no assurance that in the future we will be able to continue to successfully attain and maintain significant market acceptance of our products among physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the health care community. Failure to do so could adversely affect the value we receive from any sale of such products or businesses as part of our monetization strategy.\nAlso, we have experienced generic product competition for our products, which may increase in the future and reduce our market share. In March 2019, under an agreement with Prasco Laboratories, and in anticipation of the launch of third party generic aliskiren products by Par Pharmaceuticals, we launched in the United States an authorized generic form of Tekturna. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain meaningful revenues from sales of this authorized generic product, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain market acceptance of this authorized generic product.\nIn addition, our acquisition of LENSAR resulted in establishing our Medical Devices segment. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to successfully develop this segment on a commercial scale. Any failures or perceived difficulties in developing these assets on a commercial sale in the future could have an adverse impact on our business, and could limit the value we may realize with respect to LENSAR.\nOur strategic investment in the common stock of Evofem is our sole asset in our Strategic Positions segment. The value of our Evofem common stock is dependent upon the success of the product candidates under development by Evofem. Evofem is a pre-commercial company and, as such, is not yet engaged in revenue-generating activities. As a minority stockholder of Evofem, we have no control or oversight over the management of the Evofem business, and the value of our Evofem common stock will depend on the Evofem management team\u2019s ability to develop, raise capital and successfully market and sell Amphora, the failure of which would have a material adverse effect on our investment and the value thereof. There can be no assurance as to the value we are able to achieve regarding monetization of our investment in Evofem.\nWe are substantially dependent on our key employees to facilitate the consummation of our monetization strategy and to continue to operate our business until the strategy is fully executed, and it may be difficult to retain such employees.\nIn December 2019, we implemented a strategic process to monetize our existing assets and return net proceeds to our stockholders. In order to successfully operate our business prior to finalization of our monetization process, we must retain certain of our key personnel. Certain of our employees have a significant amount of know-how and experience in our company, and the loss of one or more of them could have a material and adverse effect on our operations or ability to implement our monetization strategy. In an effort to retain key personnel for our monetization strategy, we implemented a wind-down retention plan that provides certain benefits to employees in consideration for their continued employment with the company. Despite our efforts to retain these employees, one or more may terminate their employment with us on short notice. The loss of the services of any of these employees could potentially harm our ability to implement our monetization strategy and evaluate and pursue strategic transactions, continue to operate our business during the execution of the strategy and fulfill our reporting obligations as a public company. If we are unsuccessful in retaining qualified personnel, our ability to execute our monetization strategy may be adversely affected.\nDistributions to our stockholders may be treated as a dividend to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits, rather than a distribution in exchange for our stock.\nGenerally, a distribution by us to our stockholders would constitute dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits, as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles. However, distributions by us to our stockholders in \u201ccomplete liquidation\u201d would be treated as payment in exchange for our stock. The term \u201ccomplete liquidation\u201d is not defined in the Internal Revenue Code. While we expect our monetization strategy to be implemented in a manner so as to cause distributions to our stockholders to qualify as one or more distributions in \u201ccomplete liquidation\u201d for federal income tax purposes, there can be no assurance that efforts to do so will be successful or that the Internal Revenue Service will not take a contrary position. To the extent that any distributions do not qualify as distributions in \u201ccomplete liquidation\u201d, they will be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as dividends to our stockholders to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits.\nOur results of operations and/or our monetization strategy could be materially negatively affected by market fluctuations, business or economic disruptions or public health risks.\nOur results of operations and/or our monetization strategy could be materially negatively affected by economic conditions generally, both in the United States and elsewhere around the world. Concerns over inflation, energy costs, geopolitical issues, public health emergencies, the availability and cost of credit, and the U.S. financial markets have in the past contributed to, and may continue in the future to contribute to, increased volatility and diminished expectations for the economy and the markets. For example, in December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus surfaced in Wuhan, China. The coronavirus has impacted the global economy, including limiting business activities in China and South Korea, and may impact our operations including, among other things, sales to international customers (including those in China and South Korea) and the potential interruption of LENSAR\u2019s supply chain. Further, entities in which we have invested, including Evofem, may be negatively impacted by the coronavirus, which could decrease the value of our investment and impact our ability to liquidate our investment on favorable terms, or at all. The extent to which public health issues or pandemics, including the coronavirus, will impact our results of operations and the results of operations of the entities in which we have invested will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the coronavirus and the actions to contain the coronavirus or treat its impact, among others. In addition, domestic and international equity and debt markets have experienced and may continue to experience heightened volatility and turmoil based on domestic and international economic conditions and concerns. In the event these economic conditions and concerns continue or worsen and the markets continue to remain volatile, our results of operations could be adversely affected by those factors in many ways and our stock price or the value of our assets may decline. In addition, we maintain significant amounts of cash and cash equivalents at one or more financial institutions that are not federally insured. If economic instability continues, we cannot provide assurance that we will not experience losses on these investments. The occurrence of any of the foregoing events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and/or our ability to return value to our stockholders, including through our monetization strategy.\nOur ability to successfully complete our monetization strategy could be materially negatively affected by public health risks such as the recent outbreak of the coronavirus.\nWe are exploring and evaluating potential transactions in furtherance of our monetization strategy, the success of which may be impacted by the growing spread of the coronavirus globally. In order to successfully monetize our assets, we must identify and complete one or more transactions with third parties. The business and assets and the availability of potential buyers of our company or certain of our assets may be significantly impacted by public health issues or pandemics, including the coronavirus. The uncertain severity and impact of the coronavirus could result in reduced demand for our assets by third parties globally as well as potentially affect our own ability to operate.\nEven if we are able to identify potential transactions in furtherance of our monetization strategy, such buyers may be operationally constrained or unable to locate financing on attractive terms or at all, which risk may be heightened due to the uncertainty of the coronavirus and its impact. We are subject to increased risk that the growing spread of the coronavirus will affect the geographies, both in the near term and in the future, of any third parties we identify as possible counterparties to any monetization transaction. If financing is unavailable to potential buyers of our company or assets, or if potential buyers are unwilling to engage in various transactions due to the uncertainty in the market, our ability to complete such acquisition would be significantly impaired.\nAny negative impact on such third parties due to any of the foregoing events could cause costly delays and have a material adverse effect on our ability to return value to our stockholders, including our ability to realize full value from a sale or other disposition of our assets as part of our monetization strategy. In addition, if members of our management team were to be affected by COVID-19, this could significantly delay or impair our ability to execute our monetization strategy.\nOur ability to realize value from our investments in Evofem and LENSAR may depend on whether they can successfully develop, gain approval for and commercialize products. Failure of Evofem to successfully develop, gain approval or commercialize Amphora for prevention of pregnancy would likely cause its business to fail, which would diminish or\neliminate the value of our investment in Evofem. Failure of LENSAR to successfully continue its development and commercialization of a next generation cataract laser surgery system could negatively affect our ability to realize full value from a sale or other disposition of the business as part of our asset monetization strategy.\nThe value of our investment in Evofem and LENSAR may be dependent on their ability to successfully develop their respective products.\nEvofem resubmitted an NDA for Amphora for the prevention of pregnancy in 2019; however, there is no assurance that the FDA will approve Amphora for this indication or for any other indication. Evofem has not received regulatory approval for any product. Even though Evofem was able to successfully complete its clinical trial for Amphora for prevention of pregnancy, it may be unable to obtain regulatory approval for Amphora for prevention of pregnancy. The state of development of Amphora, including the FDA review and approval process, at the time we determine optimal to dispose of our investment position in Evofem will have a significant impact in the potential value realized and is entirely out of our control. The commercial success of Amphora will also depend in significant measure upon Evofem\u2019s ability to obtain marketing approval from the FDA or other regulatory authorities including an indication and labeling of sufficient scope to be commercially meaningful. Failure to achieve marketing approval from the FDA or other regulatory authorities of a commercially meaningful indication and labeling may substantially limit Evofem\u2019s ability to market and promote Amphora and our ability to monetize or otherwise dispose of our investment in Evofem. In addition, to obtain marketing approval of Amphora on schedule, manufacturing facilities operated by third parties with which Evofem has contracted for the purpose of the supply of Amphora will need to pass a regulatory inspection. Failure of the FDA to approve manufacture of Amphora at such third party facilities may delay approval, and consequently affect the value of our investment in Evofem. Evofem will also likely incur significant costs associated with launching and Amphora, including the development of a successful commercial team and strategy. The failure of Evofem to successfully develop, gain marketing approval and commercialize Amphora would have a material adverse impact on our investment in Evofem and could limit any upside, or result in a loss, on our investment, or limit our ability to generate significant value for stockholders in connection with the potential disposition of our investment in furtherance of our monetization strategy.\nLENSAR is developing and intends to commercialize a next generation cataract laser surgery system. The value we are able to obtain from our investment in LENSAR may depend on the value investors and/or potential acquirors perceive in the next generation system, which may not be in condition for approval or commercialization prior to our monetization of LENSAR. The development process for new devices in the eye care industry and more general healthcare industry can sometimes be expensive, prolonged and entail considerable uncertainty. Because of the complexities and uncertainties associated with ophthalmic research and development in particular, and healthcare related research and development in general, products LENSAR is currently developing, or that may be developed in the future, are subject to the risk that LENSAR may not complete the development process or obtain the regulatory approvals required to market such products successfully. These complexities and risks could significantly reduce the value we are able to achieve during the monetization process from our investment in LENSAR.\nWe may be unable to monetize our investment in Evofem due to the illiquidity of our shares, and our position in Evofem may be subject to dilution and fluctuations in value, each of which could have a material and adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and/or ability to monetize or otherwise dispose of our position.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we held approximately 28% of the shares of common stock of Evofem. Our shares of Evofem were acquired in a private placement and, absent registration, are deemed to be restricted stock. A such, it may be difficult to sell our Evofem shares in connection with our monetization strategy, and any such sale may be delayed due to the lead time required to register such shares with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nFurthermore, it is expected that Evofem will seek to raise significant additional capital to finance its operations in the future. Raising additional capital may cause substantial dilution in our investment and such financing activities could limit our ability to generate a meaningful return or sell our investment as we attempt to monetize or otherwise dispose of our position.\nWe account for our investment in Evofem using the fair value method. Because a mark to market valuation will occur at the end of each quarterly reporting period, changes in fair value will vary based upon the volatility of the stock price, and such changes in fair value could have a material and adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we do not meet the requirements for continued listing on The Nasdaq Stock Market, our common stock could be delisted which would adversely affect the ability of our stockholders to sell shares of our common stock.\nOur common stock is currently listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market. The Nasdaq Stock Market imposes continued listing requirements that companies must meet to remain listed on that market. These requirements include, among other things,\nminimum levels of assets and revenues. The Nasdaq Stock Market also considers factors like the number of employees of a company and a company\u2019s ongoing revenue generating operations and plans. If we do not meet the requirements for continued listing on The Nasdaq Stock Market, whether as a result of our monetization and distribution of net proceeds to stockholders or otherwise, our common stock could be delisted. Further, upon dissolution, we anticipate that our stock would then be delisted from Nasdaq and our stock transfer books closed, after which time it would not be possible for stockholders to publicly trade our stock. At that point, the proportionate interests of all of our stockholders will be fixed on the basis of their respective stock holdings at the close of business on the final record date, and, after the final record date, in general any distributions made by us will be made solely to the stockholders of record at the close of business on the final record date. The delisting of our common stock would have an adverse effect on the liquidity of our common stock, such as the ability of our stockholders to sell their shares of our common stock, and its trading price. If our common stock ceases to be traded or quoted on any of the NYSE, the NASDAQ Global Select Market or the NASDAQ Global Market, a \u201cfundamental change\u201d under each of our convertible notes indentures would occur, which entitles the holders of the convertible notes issued under such indentures to require us to repurchase the convertible notes of such holders. Delisting could also have other negative results, including, but not limited to, the potential loss of confidence by employees, the loss of institutional investor interest and fewer opportunities with counterparties to potential monetization transactions.\nIf we remain an independent company, we may need to obtain funds from additional financings or other sources for our business activities. If we do not receive these funds, we may need to reduce, delay or eliminate some of our expenditures.\nIf we are not successful in implementing, or the board of directors decides to terminate, the monetization strategy, and we were to therefore remain an independent company, we may need to raise additional capital to accomplish our business plan over the next several years through debt or equity financing, joint ventures, license agreements, sale of assets, as well as various other financing arrangements. If we obtain additional funds by issuing equity securities, dilution to stockholders may occur. There can be no assurance as to the availability or terms upon which such financing and capital might be available.\nThrough our investments in Noden and Evofem, and our acquisition of LENSAR, we have a significant investment in the commercialization of products worldwide, and our returns from these assets are subject to a number of risks associated with international operations that could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows and/or our ability to monetize or otherwise dispose of such assets.\nAs a result of our Noden and LENSAR operating businesses, and our strategic investment in Evofem, we are directly and indirectly subject to a number of risks related to the sale of products worldwide, including:\n\u2022\ninternational regulatory requirements for drug and medical device marketing and pricing in foreign countries;\n\u2022\nvaried standards of care in various countries that could complicate the commercial success of products;\n\u2022\nvaried drug and medical device import and export rules;\n\u2022\nvarying standards for the protection of intellectual property rights which may result in reduced or compromised exclusivity in certain countries;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers and regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nvaried reimbursement systems and different competitive drugs indicated to treat the indications for which Noden Products are being commercialized and medical devices indicated to treat the indications for which LENSAR products are being commercialized;\n\u2022\neconomic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets;\n\u2022\nwidespread outbreak of health epidemics that could impact international sales and operations;\n\u2022\ncompliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws applicable to foreign operations;\n\u2022\ncompliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d), the UK Bribery Act, and other anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws;\n\u2022\nforeign taxes and duties;\n\u2022\nforeign currency fluctuations and other obligations incident to doing business in another country;\n\u2022\nworkforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States;\n\u2022\nreliance on management, contract services organizations and other third parties that may be less experienced with manufacturing and commercialization than the party from whom the Noden Products were acquired;\n\u2022\npotential liability resulting from product liability laws or the activities of foreign distributors; and\n\u2022\nbusiness interruptions resulting from geopolitical actions, including war and terrorism, or natural disasters.\nIn addition, our international operations could be affected by capital and exchange controls, expropriation and other restrictive government actions as well as by political unrest, unstable governments and legal systems and inter-governmental disputes. Any of these circumstances could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows, as well as adversely affect our ability to monetize or dispose of such assets and/or reduce the proceeds we realize in such a monetization or disposition.\nThe terms of our convertible notes indentures could negatively affect our ability to execute the monetization strategy.\nIn addition to the requirement under our convertible notes indentures for us to repurchase the convertible notes upon the election of the holders of such convertible notes upon a \u201cfundamental change,\u201d each of the convertible notes indentures includes a merger covenant that requires any successor company that purchases \u201csubstantially all\u201d of our property and assets to assume the obligations under such convertible notes indenture. There is no precise established definition of the phrase \u201csubstantially all\u201d under New York law, the law which governs each of our convertible notes indentures, and whether a transaction or series of transactions constitutes \u201csubstantially all\u201d of our property and assets depends on the consideration of both quantitative and qualitative factors. Consequently, depending on the transactions pursued by us in connection with the monetization strategy and the sequencing and timing of these transactions, our monetization strategy could result in a transfer of \u201csubstantially all\u201d of our properties and assets under each of our convertible notes indentures, which would require the transferee under such monetization strategy to assume the obligations under such convertible notes indenture and could thus negatively affect our ability to execute the monetization strategy. In order to minimize the impact of the merger covenants in our convertible notes indentures on our ability to execute the monetization strategy, we could either conduct a tender offer for our outstanding convertible notes or could solicit consents from the holders of our outstanding convertible notes to waive the requirements of such merger covenants, or could pursue a combination of tender offers and consent solicitations, but we cannot assure you that any such tender offers or consent solicitations would become effective or that they would be agreed upon on commercially acceptable terms.\nWe have in the past and are currently involved in, and expect that in the future we will from time to time be involved in, litigation, either as a defendant or a plaintiff, which could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and cash flows and/or our monetization strategy.\nMonitoring and defending against or prosecuting legal actions is time-consuming for our management, will require litigation related expenses, and may detract from our ability to fully focus our internal resources on our operations and monetization strategy. Moreover, we may be subject to additional litigation as we pursue potential transactions in furtherance of our monetization strategy, and expect to be subject to increased risk of litigation following the completion of the divestiture of all or a portion of our assets or businesses, a spin-off transaction, a merger, or any combination thereof. In addition, the stock markets have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices for the common stock of companies. These broad market fluctuations as well a broad range of other factors, including the realization of any of the risks described in these \u201cRisk Factors,\u201d may cause the market price of our common stock to decline. In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company involved in significant corporate transaction or following a decline in the market price of its securities. Legal fees and costs incurred in connection with litigation may be significant. Depending on the nature of the lawsuit, a decision adverse to our interests could result in the payment of substantial damages and could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow, results of operations, financial position and ability to return value to stockholders, or impact our rights in an adverse way. In addition, if we elect to file a certificate of dissolution, we may be subject to litigation with potential or unknown claimants, which litigation will have an effect on the timing and ability of the Company to make distributions to stockholders, and will be accompanied by litigation related costs and operations.\nWe rely on third-party manufacturers to manufacture our pharmaceutical products, and these third parties may not perform adequately.\nWe do not have any operating manufacturing facilities for Noden Products, and do not expect to independently manufacture our products under the Pharmaceutical segment. We currently rely on Novartis for a specified period of time to manufacture and package the Noden Products.\nRisks arising from reliance on third-party manufacturers include:\n\u2022\nreduced control and additional burdens of oversight as a result of using third-party manufacturers for all aspects of manufacturing activities, including regulatory compliance and quality control and assurance;\n\u2022\ntermination or non-renewal of manufacturing and supply agreements with third parties in a manner or at a time that may negatively impact commercialization activities; and\n\u2022\ndisruption in the operations of third-party manufacturers or suppliers unrelated to our products, including the bankruptcy of the manufacturer or supplier or a catastrophic event affecting the third manufacturers or suppliers.\nIn addition, difficulties or delays in product manufacturing and reliance on third-party manufacturing could adversely affect performance of Noden and the Noden Products by virtue of regulatory actions, shut-downs, approval delays, withdrawals, recalls, penalties, supply disruptions or shortages or force majeure events, reputational harm, product liability, unanticipated costs or otherwise. Examples of such difficulties or delays include, but are not limited to, the possibility that the supply of incoming materials may be delayed or become unavailable or be subject to increased costs and that the quality of incoming materials may be substandard and not detected; the possibility that third-party manufacturers may fail to maintain appropriate quality standards throughout the internal and external supply network and/or comply with cGMPs and other applicable regulations such as tracking and tracing of products in the supply chain to enhance patient safety; risks to supply chain continuity as a result of natural or man-made disasters at a supplier or vendor; or failure to maintain the integrity of the supply chains against intentional and criminal acts such as economic adulteration, product diversion, product theft, and counterfeit goods. Any of these events could adversely affect our ability to successfully commercialize our products and/or our ability to sell our products as part of our monetization strategy or realize expected value in such a sale.\nOur products are subject to the risks and uncertainties of branded pharmaceutical and medical device products.\nIf our products become subject to problems such as changes in prescription growth rates, product utilization, product liability litigation, unexpected side effects, regulatory proceedings, manufacturing issues, publicity affecting doctor or patient confidence, pressure from existing competitive products, changes in labeling, loss of patent protection (when applicable), or, if a new, more effective treatment should be introduced, the adverse impact on our revenues could be significant. The occurrence of any of the foregoing problems, or additional problems that may arise in the future, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, and/or our ability to successfully monetize the underlying assets pursuant to our monetization strategy.\nFor as long as we own our Noden business, we will continue to depend upon a limited number of wholesalers for a significant portion of our revenues from the Noden Products, and the loss of, or significant reduction in sales to, any one of these wholesalers could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition and/or our ability to sell Noden or its assets, as well as materially reduce the amount of value we could realize in such a sale.\nWe sell the Noden Products primarily to wholesalers. Wholesalers sell the Noden Products to hospitals and pharmacies. We do not promote the Noden Products to wholesalers, and they do not set or determine demand for Noden Products. Our ability to successfully commercialize Noden Products will depend, in part, on the extent to which we are able to provide adequate distribution of the Noden Products to patients. Although we have contracted with a number of wholesalers, they are expected generally to carry a very limited inventory and may be reluctant to be part of our distribution network in the future if demand for the product does not increase.\nThe use of pharmaceutical wholesalers involves certain risks, including, but not limited to, risks that these pharmaceutical wholesalers will not provide us accurate or timely information regarding their inventories, demand from wholesaler customers buying the Noden Products or complaints about the Noden Products, that these wholesalers will reduce their efforts or discontinue to sell or support or otherwise not effectively sell or support the Noden Products, or not devote the resources necessary to sell the Noden Products in the volumes and within the time frames that we expect.\nFurther, it is possible that these wholesalers could decide to change their policies or fees, or both, at some time in the future. This could result in their refusal to carry smaller volume products such as Noden Products, or lower margins or the need to find alternative methods of distributing the Noden Products. Although we believe we can find alternative channels to distribute the Noden Products on relatively short notice, our revenue during that period of time may suffer and we may incur additional costs to replace any such wholesaler. The loss of any large wholesaler as part of our distribution network, a significant reduction in sales we make to wholesalers, or any failure to pay for the Noden Products we have shipped to them could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition and/or our ability to sell Noden, as well as materially reduce the amount of value we could realize in such a sale.\nCertain of our income generating assets are secured by collateral, and we may be, or may become, under-secured by the collateral, or such collateral may not have a value equal to our investment in the event of a default by our counterparties, or may lose value, each of which could negatively affect our ability recuperate our capital expenditures in such income generating assets.\nAmong our current income generating assets, the Wellstat Diagnostics loan and the CareView loan have exposed us to credit risk due to default or potential default by the counterparty. To mitigate this risk at the initiation of the loans, we obtained security\ninterests as collateral in the assets of such counterparty. Our credit risk in respect of such counterparty may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount we are due pursuant to the terms of the particular credit agreement. This could occur in circumstances where the original collateral was not sufficient to cover a complete loss (e.g., our interests were only partially secured) or may result from the deterioration in value of the collateral, so that, in either such case, we are unable to recover our full capital outlay and any anticipated return. Obligations under these credit agreements are secured by a pledge of substantially all the assets of the borrower and any of its subsidiaries and, in the instance of Wellstat Diagnostics, by assets held by its affiliates. Although these loans are secured, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to collect all or part of the amounts owed to us. If we are unable to collect any amount, or amounts collected are not equal to our investment in the event of default by our counterparties, the value of our assets may decrease, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, and/or our ability to successfully monetize the underlying assets pursuant to our monetization strategy. Additionally, we may face difficulty in collection efforts with respect to the Wellstat Diagnostics and CareView loans. Such difficulties with the CareView loan could lead to litigation or other legal procedures which may or may not be successful, and which will require significant financial and management resources to address. We have been engaged in multiple legal proceedings with Wellstat Diagnostics and its affiliates related to their credit agreement default, which is described in more detail in Note 25, Legal Proceedings, of this Annual Report. Any such losses resulting therefrom could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are exposed to the credit risk of some of our customers, which could result in material losses.\nIn our Medical Devices segment, customers may finance through leasing the acquisition of certain devices, and we believe there has been an increase in demand for customer financing through leasing in recent years. We may experience loss from a customer\u2019s failure to make payments according to the contractual lease terms. Our exposure to the credit risks relating to our lease financing arrangements may increase if our customers are adversely affected by changes in healthcare laws, coverage and reimbursement, economic pressures or uncertainty, or other customer-specific factors. The factors affecting our customers\u2019 ability to make timely payments according to the contractual lease terms are out of our control, and as a result, exposes us to additional risks that may materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. The occurrence of any such factors affecting our customers may cause delays in payments or, in some cases, defaults on payment obligations, which could result in material losses.\nAlthough we have programs in place that are designed to monitor and mitigate the associated risk, there can be no assurance that such programs will be effective in reducing credit risks relating to these lease financing arrangements. If the level of credit losses we experience in the future exceed our expectations, such losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations or adversely affect our ability to sell such assets as part of our monetization strategy.\nWe, our licensees, borrowers and royalty-agreement counterparties and the companies in which we invest may be unable to maintain regulatory approvals for currently licensed products, or to obtain regulatory approvals or favorable pricing for new products, and we or they may voluntarily remove currently licensed products from marketing and commercial distribution. Any of such events, whether due to safety issues or other factors, could reduce our revenues or return on investments, and could limit our ability to generate expected returns from the monetization of such assets.\nWe and our licensees, borrowers and royalty-agreement counterparties and companies in which we have invested, are subject to stringent regulation with respect to product safety and efficacy by various international, federal, state and local authorities. Of particular significance are the FDA requirements covering research and development, testing, manufacturing, quality control, labeling and promotion of drugs and medical devices for human use in the United States. As a result of these requirements, the length of time, the level of expenditures and the laboratory and clinical information required for approval of a biologic license application or new drug application and approval or clearance of a medical device are substantial and can require a number of years. In addition, even if our products, our licensees\u2019, borrowers\u2019 and royalty-agreement counterparties\u2019 products or products of companies in which we invest receive regulatory approval, we and they will remain subject to ongoing FDA and other international regulations including, but not limited to, obligations to conduct additional clinical trials or other testing, changes to the product label, new or revised regulatory requirements for manufacturing practices, written advisements to physicians and/or a product recall or withdrawal. We, our licensees, borrowers and royalty-agreement counterparties and the companies in which we invest may not maintain necessary regulatory approvals for our or their existing licensed products or we or our licensees may not obtain necessary regulatory approvals on a timely basis, if at all, for any of our products, or the licensed products our licensees are developing or manufacturing. Moreover, the current political environment in the United States is focused on potential reductions in pricing for pharmaceutical and other healthcare products, which may negatively impact any existing or new products from which our revenues would be derived. We are unable to control the pricing strategies used by our licensees, borrowers and royalty-agreement counterparties and may have limited influence over the pricing strategies used by companies in which we invest, and if they fail to use appropriate pricing strategies, or receive negative reactions to their pricing strategies, it could negatively impact our revenues or return on investment. We may also select pricing strategies for our own products and medical\ndevices that are less competitive than those of our competitors, or we may fail to obtain acceptable prices or an adequate level of reimbursement for products or medical devices from third-party payors or governmental agencies, which could negatively impact our revenues or return on investment and could limit our ability to generate expected returns from the monetization of such assets.\nIn addition, communications from government officials regarding pricing for pharmaceutical and other health care products could have a negative impact on our stock price or the value of the assets we are seeking to monetize, even if such communications do not ultimately impact our products, our licensees\u2019, borrowers\u2019 and royalty-agreement counterparties\u2019 products or the products of companies in which we invest. The occurrence of adverse events reported by any licensee, borrower or royalty-agreement counterparty or company in which we invest may result in the revocation of regulatory approvals or decreased sales of the applicable product due to a change in physicians\u2019 willingness to prescribe, or patients\u2019 willingness to use the applicable product. We, our licensees, borrowers and royalty-agreement counterparties and the companies in which we invest could also choose to voluntarily remove licensed products from marketing and commercial distribution. For example, in November 2011, the FDA removed the indication for breast cancer from Avastin\u2019s label. In 2005, Tysabri was temporarily suspended and then returned to the market. In any of these cases, our revenues or return on investment could be materially and adversely affected. Moreover, any value we may receive upon the potential sale of our company or other potential transaction in furtherance of our monetization strategy could be materially and adversely affected.\nIn addition, the current regulatory framework could change, or additional regulations could arise at any stage during our licensees\u2019 or invested company\u2019s product development or marketing which may affect their ability to obtain or maintain approval of their respective products. Delays in our licensees or the companies in which we have invested receiving regulatory approval for their respective products or their failure to maintain existing regulatory approvals could have a material adverse effect on our business or our ability to successfully implement our monetization strategy.\nMany of our pharmaceutical products, investments, medical devices and income generating assets are in companies or assets that have limited commercialized revenue-generating products or are dependent on the actions of unrelated third parties, which may negatively impact the value we are able to realize as part of our monetization strategy.\nOur ability to realize full value for certain of our assets (including in connection with executing a successful monetization strategy) depends on the progress of such assets towards commercialization, and the ability to further the development in a competitive and highly regulated market. Our or our counterparties or their licensees inability to do so would negatively affect our investment returns and could limit our ability to generate expected returns from the monetization of such assets.\nIn addition, in connection with our income generating assets and our investments in our Strategic Positions segment, we are dependent, to a large extent, on third parties to enforce certain rights for our benefit. For example, when we acquired certain royalty rights from Assertio (formerly Depomed), which, as the licensor of certain patents, retains various rights, including the contractual right to audit its licensees and to ensure those licensees are complying with the terms of the underlying license agreements. Assertio also retained full responsibility to protect and maintain the intellectual property rights underlying the licenses. While we have contractual rights to require Assertio to take action regarding many of these rights, because Assertio\u2019s economic interest in the license agreements is limited, it may not enforce or protect those rights as it otherwise would have had it retained the full economic interest in the payments under the license agreements. Moreover, in respect of the royalty stream relating to the Glumetza diabetes medication that we acquired from Assertio, which is the royalty right producing the highest revenues from our Assertio acquired royalties, a single generic manufacturer was approved by the FDA in February 2013 and in August 2016, two additional generic manufacturers were approved by the FDA to enter the US as provided for in settlement agreements between Assertio and these generic manufacturers. In February 2016, Lupin Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and in August 2017, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., and in July 2018, Sun Pharmaceutical, Inc., each launched a generic equivalent approved product. We were aware of these settlement agreements, considered them in the cost of the acquiring this asset and expected the entry of these generic products to reduce our Glumetza revenues. We are further aware of additional approved generic extended release metformin products, which could negatively affect Glumetza revenues.\nWe and our companies\u2019 licensees, borrowers and royalty-agreement counterparties face significant market pressures with respect to our and their products, and the amount of revenues from our or their pharmaceutical products or medical devices, or from our income generating assets that we receive are subject to various competitive and market factors that may be outside of our control.\nWe and our companies, licensees, borrowers and royalty-agreement counterparties face competition from other pharmaceutical, biotechnology, device and diagnostic companies. The introduction of new competitive products may result in lost market share for us or our licensees, borrowers and royalty-agreement counterparties, reduced use of our or their products or devices, lower prices and/or reduced sales, any of which could reduce our royalty revenues, or the revenues on which we rely to produce the returns on\nour acquisitions, and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Any such reduction to revenues could further limit any realized value we may obtain in connection with the evaluation of potential transactions to monetize such assets.\nThe amount of any royalties or revenues, and the subsequent returns on our investments that we receive from our pharmaceutical products, medical devices and/or income generating assets will depend on many factors, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe timing and availability of generic product or devices competition for our products or devices, and our licensees\u2019, borrowers\u2019 and royalty-agreement counterparties\u2019 products or devices;\n\u2022\npotential challenges or design-arounds to product, use or manufacturing related patents which provide exclusivity for products and assets before their expiration by generic pharmaceutical manufacturers;\n\u2022\nthe size of the market for our products or devices, and our licensees\u2019, borrowers\u2019 and royalty-agreement counterparties\u2019 products or devices;\n\u2022\nthe extent and effectiveness of the sales and marketing and distribution support for our licensees\u2019, borrowers\u2019 and royalty-agreement counterparties\u2019 products or devices and commercial infrastructure with respect to our products or devices;\n\u2022\nthe existence of novel or superior products or devices to our products or devices, or our licensees\u2019, borrowers\u2019 and royalty-agreement counterparties\u2019 products or devices;\n\u2022\nthe availability of reduced pricing and discounts applicable to our licensees\u2019, borrowers\u2019 and royalty-agreement counterparties\u2019 products or devices;\n\u2022\nstocking and inventory management practices related to our products or our licensees\u2019, borrowers\u2019 and royalty-agreement counterparties\u2019 products or devices;\n\u2022\nlimitations on indications for which our products or devices or our licensees\u2019, borrowers\u2019 and royalty-agreement counterparties\u2019 products or devices can be marketed; the competitive landscape for approved products or devices and developing therapies that compete with our products or devices or our licensees\u2019, borrowers\u2019 and royalty-agreement counterparties\u2019 products or devices;\n\u2022\nthe ability of patients to be able to afford our products or devices, or our licensees\u2019, borrowers\u2019 and royalty-agreement counterparties\u2019 products or devices or obtain healthcare coverage that covers those products or devices;\n\u2022\nacceptance of, and ongoing satisfaction with, our products or devices and our licensees\u2019, borrowers\u2019 and royalty-agreement counterparties\u2019 products or devices by the care providers, patients receiving therapy and third-party payors; or\n\u2022\nthe unfavorable outcome of any potential litigation relating to our products or devices and our licensees\u2019, borrowers\u2019 and royalty-agreement counterparties\u2019 products or devices.\nFor example, in mid-2019, Bausch Health announced potential price decreases on Glumetza, a royalty-bearing product under our Assertio Royalty Agreement. These price decreases could negatively affect revenues and thus our royalties. Due to the uncertainties caused by changes in pricing by third parties that are outside our control, including as a result of generic competition, we may not be able to accurately estimate the impact on royalties on such sales paid to us for Glumetza or any other product.\nAdditionally, Noden\u2019s \u2019111 Patent, which was previously extended by virtue of pediatric testing requirements, expired in January 2019. While Noden has additional patent coverage related to drug formulation and manufacturing technology which relate to our commercialization of Tekturna in the United States which has not yet expired, the expiration of the composition of matter patents related to our Tekturna products will allow entry of competitors which have been able to design around the remaining formulation patents. For example, in 2018, Noden settled a paragraph IV challenge with Anchen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. which allowed entry into the market of a generic aliskiren product in March 2019, which generic product was subsequently made commercially available through Par Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and competes with Tekturna and our authorized generic product. While we are unaware of the entry of any additional third-party generic product at the present time, we cannot preclude the possibility that another third-party generic version of aliskiren will be available at some time in the future. In March 2019, under an agreement with Prasco Laboratories, we launched in the United States an authorized generic form of Tekturna which currently competes with the Par Pharmaceuticals generic aliskiren product. The increase in competition and additional generic competition may have a material and adverse effect on our ability to realize significant value for stockholders on the disposition or sale of the Noden Products in furtherance of our monetization strategy.\nWe, our licensees and the companies in which we have invested must continue to protect our and their intellectual property rights for us to protect the value of our assets and/or execute a successful monetization strategy.\nOur success in protecting the value of our assets (including in connection with executing a successful monetization strategy) is dependent in significant part on our ability and the ability of third parties in control of the assets in which we\u2019ve invested to\nprotect the scope, validity and enforceability of our and their intellectual property, including the patents, SPCs and license agreements, all of which support our revenues. The scope, validity, enforceability and effective term of patents and SPCs can be highly uncertain and often involve complex legal and factual questions and proceedings. In addition, the legal principles applicable to patents in any given jurisdiction may be altered through changing court precedent and legislative action, and such changes may affect the scope, strength and enforceability of our patent rights or the nature of proceedings which may be brought related to the relevant patent rights. A finding in a proceeding related to patent rights which support our revenues which narrows the scope or which affects the validity or enforceability of some or all of our patent rights could have a material impact on our ability to continue to collect royalty payments from our investments or collect revenue from our sales of our pharmaceutical products and medical devices. If the scope, validity and enforceability of our and their intellectual property were to be negatively impacted prior to monetizing any such assets, our expected return on such assets could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur reliance on sole and single source suppliers could harm our ability to meet demand for our products or devices in a timely manner or within budget.\nSome of the components necessary for the assembly of our Medical Devices segment are currently provided to us by sole-sourced suppliers or single-sourced suppliers. We generally purchase components through purchase orders rather than long-term supply agreements and generally do not maintain large volumes of inventory. While alternative suppliers exist and could be identified for sole-sourced components, the disruption or termination of the supply of components could cause a significant increase in the costs of these components, which could affect our operating results. A disruption or termination in the supply of components could also result in our inability to meet demand for our products, which could harm our ability to generate revenues, lead to customer dissatisfaction and damage our reputation. Furthermore, if we are required to change the manufacturer of a key component of our products, we may be required to verify that the new manufacturer maintains facilities and procedures that comply with quality standards and with all applicable regulations and guidelines. The delays associated with the verification of a new manufacturer could delay our ability to manufacture our products in a timely manner or within budget, which may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows, as well as our ability to successfully monetize or otherwise dispose of such products and/or related businesses.\nRecently enacted and future legislation is expected to increase the difficulty and costs to maintain revenues from our products, and in particular may negatively impact the pricing of our products and/or the ability to realize value as part of our monetization strategy.\nIn the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could, among other things, affect our ability to profitably sell our products.\nFor example, in the United States in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\u201cACA\u201d) was enacted to increase access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and the health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. The law has continued the downward pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medicare program, and increased the industry\u2019s regulatory burdens and operating costs. Among the provisions of the ACA of importance are the following:\n\u2022\nmanufacturers and importers of certain branded prescription drugs with annual sales of more than $5 million made to or covered by specified federal healthcare programs are required to pay an annual, non-tax deductible fee based on each company\u2019s market share of all such sales in the prior year;\n\u2022\nan increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program for brand and generic drugs;\n\u2022\na new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected;\n\u2022\nextension of manufacturers\u2019 Medicaid rebate liability to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;\n\u2022\nexpansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs in certain states;\n\u2022\na new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries under their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer\u2019s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D. Subsequent legislative amendments have increased the point-of-sale discounted to 70%, effective 2019;\n\u2022\nexpansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program, commonly referred to as the \u201c340B Program\u201d;\n\u2022\na new requirement to annually report drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians, also known as the \u201cPhysicians Payment Sunshine Act\u201d; and\n\u2022\na new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.\nThe potential financial impact of the ACA over the next few years will depend on a number of factors including policies reflected in implementing regulations and guidance and changes in sales volumes for products affected by the new system of rebates, discounts and fees. The taxes imposed by the ACA and the expansion in the government\u2019s role in the U.S. healthcare industry may result in decreased profits to us, lower reimbursement by payors for our products, and/or reduced medical procedure volumes, all of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The Trump Administration and the U.S. Congress may take further action regarding the ACA, including, but not limited to, repeal or replacement. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \u201c2017 Tax Act\u201d) was enacted, which, among other things, removes penalties for not complying with the individual mandate to carry health insurance. On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas, ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the ACA, and therefore, because it was repealed as part of the 2017 Tax Act, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. On December 18, 2019, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the portion of the district court\u2019s ruling declaring the individual mandate unconstitutional and remanded for the district court to conduct analysis in the first instance on which provisions of the statute are severable from it and thus remain intact. On March 2, 2020, the Supreme Court of the United States granted certiorari to hear the case. While the Trump Administration and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services have both stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect, it is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals, including the aforementioned appeal, and other efforts to repeal and replace the ACA will impact the ACA. There may be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future, including continued litigation and legislation, and all or a portion of the ACA and related subsequent legislation may be modified, repealed or otherwise invalidated through judicial challenge. We cannot predict the ultimate content, timing or effect of any healthcare reform legislation or the impact of potential legislation on us and will continue to evaluate the effect that the ACA and its possible repeal and replacement has on our business.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. These changes included automatic aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year as part of the federal budget sequestration under the Budget Control Act of 2011, which went into effect in April 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will remain in effect through 2025 unless additional action is taken by Congress. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers and increased the statute of limitations period in which the government may recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. In addition, recently there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which drug manufacturers set prices for their commercial products and regulatory action aimed at reducing the cost of prescription drugs. For example, in December 2019, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the FDA issued a proposed rule and draft guidance concerning two new pathways for importing lower-cost drugs into the United States. The proposed rule, if finalized, would allow certain prescription drugs to be imported from Canada. The draft guidance describes procedures for drug manufacturers to facilitate the importation of FDA-approved drugs and biologics manufactured abroad and originally intended for sale in a foreign country into the United States. Additionally, President Trump\u2019s administration has proposed to establish an international pricing index that would tie domestic prices for certain drugs and biologics to the prices in other countries with more aggressive drug price regulation. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may limit us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercializing our products, which could have a material adverse effect on business and results of operations.\nIn any event, we expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for pharmaceutical products, which could result in reduced demand for our products or our counterparties\u2019 products or additional pricing pressures on our products or our counterparties\u2019 products, as well as negatively affect our ability to successfully execute our monetization strategy.\nChanges in third-party coverage and reimbursement may affect sales of our products, product sales from which we receive royalty revenues and the products our borrowers sell to generate revenues and the growth of managed care organizations (\u201cMCOs\u201d), is expected to increase pricing pressures on our products in the United States.\nSales of our products, product sales from which we receive royalties and the products our borrowers sell to generate revenues will depend significantly on the extent to which reimbursement for the cost of such products and related treatments will be available to physicians and patients from various levels of United States and international government health authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. Third-party payers and government health administration authorities increasingly attempt to limit and/or regulate the coverage and reimbursement of medical products and services, including branded prescription drugs. Changes\nin government legislation or regulation, such as the ACA, and changes in formulary or compendia listing or changes in private third-party payers\u2019 policies toward reimbursement for such products may reduce reimbursement of the cost of such products to physicians, pharmacies and distributors. Decreases in third-party reimbursement could reduce usage of such products and sales to collaborators, which may have a material adverse effect on our revenues derived from our products, those from which we receive royalties from the business of our borrowers. In addition, macroeconomic factors may affect the ability of patients to pay or co-pay for costs or otherwise pay for our products or the products from which we, our royalty counterparties and borrowers generate revenues by, for example, decreasing the number of patients covered by insurance policies or increasing costs associated with such policies. All of these factors could negatively impact our ability to sell or otherwise dispose of our assets or reduce the value we realize as we seek to execute our monetization strategy.\nIn the United States in particular, the influence of MCOs has increased in recent years due to the growing number of patients receiving coverage through MCOs. The growth of MCOs has increased pressure on drug prices as well as revenues for pharmaceutical companies. One objective of MCOs is to contain and, where possible, reduce healthcare expenditures. MCOs typically use formularies as a means to negotiate prices with pharmaceutical providers; physician protocols requiring prior authorization for a branded product if a generic product is available or requiring the patient to first fail on one or more generic products before permitting access to a branded medicine; volume purchasing; and long-term contracts. In addition, by placing branded medicines on higher-tier status in their formularies or non-preferred tier status, MCOs transfer a portion of the cost of those medicines to the patient (through and increase in co-payment requirements), resulting in significant out-of-pocket expenses for the patient. This financial disincentive is a means by which MCOs manage drug costs and influence patients to use medicines preferred by the MCOs.\nExclusion of a product from a formulary or other MCO-implemented restrictions can significantly impact drug usage in the MCO patient population. Consequently, pharmaceutical companies compete to gain access to formularies for their products. Unique product features, such as greater efficacy, better patient ease of use, or fewer side effects, are generally beneficial to achieving access to formularies. Larger pharmaceutical companies have the ability to bundle available products and discounts in an effort to place and maintain products on formulary. We will be responsible for meeting the requirements of MCO\u2019s in the United States and ensuring the competitive use of our products in a highly uncertain and changing environment. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain the level of use of our products, and their inability to do so could have a material adverse impact on the value we receive from any sale of our products or related businesses as part of our asset monetization strategy.\nGeneric products may increase pricing pressures on our products.\nAlthough we believe that our products benefit from issued and/or pending patents as well as proprietary manufacturing technology, one competitive challenge that our branded pharmaceuticals products face is or will be from generic pharmaceutical manufacturers. Upon the expiration or loss of patent protection for a product, especially a small molecule product, the major portion of revenues for that product may be dramatically reduced in a very short period of time. Several such competitors make a regular practice of challenging product patents before their expiration. Also, manufacturers of generic pharmaceutical products may file or have already filed an abbreviated NDA (\u201cANDA\u201d) with the FDA seeking to market generic forms of our products prior to the expiration of relevant patents owned by Noden. In June 2018, Noden Pharma DAC entered into a settlement agreement with Anchen pursuant to which Anchen, the sole ANDA filer for Tekturna of which the Company is aware, was granted a license from Noden to commercialize its generic form of aliskiren starting March 1, 2019. Under their license, Anchen may commercialize their formulation of aliskiren, but is not permitted to commercialize a generic version of aliskiren which closely relates to the formulation of Tekturna. As a result of a settlement with Anchen, Par Pharmaceuticals has commercialized a generic form of aliskiren. Further patent litigation and other challenges to Noden\u2019s patents would be costly and unpredictable, would require extensive management time and resources, and may ultimately deprive us of market exclusivity for our products in a given geographical territory. The FDA ANDA approval process exempts generics from costly and time-consuming clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy, as long as they can scientifically demonstrate that their product performs in the same manner as the innovator drug, thus allowing generic manufacturers to rely on the safety and efficacy data of the innovator\u2019s product. Generic competitors do not generally need to conduct clinical trials and can market a competing version of a product after the expiration or loss of patent or regulatory exclusivity and often charge significantly lower prices. In addition, as noted above, MCOs that focus primarily on the immediate cost of medicines often favor generics over branded drugs. Many governments also encourage the use of generics as alternatives to brand-name drugs in their healthcare programs. Additionally, certain foreign governments have indicated that compulsory licenses to patents may be granted in the case of national emergencies or in other circumstances, which could diminish or eliminate sales and profits from those regions, negatively affect our results of operations and cash flows, lead to an impairment charge of our long-lived assets or result in a material decline of our revenue. In March 2019, under an agreement with Prasco Laboratories, we launched in the United States an authorized generic form of Tekturna which competes with the Par Pharmaceuticals generic aliskiren product. Pricing pressure could reduce the value of the product, and consequently of Noden, as we seek to sell it as part of our monetization strategy.\nOur ability to generate revenue from an authorized generic may be limited in the future.\nIn March 2019, we launched in the United States aliskiren hemifumarate tablets, 150 mg and 300 mg, an authorized generic of Tekturna, through Prasco Laboratories under an agreement with Noden Pharma DAC. Our ability to generate revenue related to our authorized generic may be limited for a number of reasons, including, without limitation, the entry into the market of additional generic products, the ratings for any existing or potential additional generic products, and the effect of increased generic competition on pricing. All of these factors could materially and adversely affect Noden\u2019s business and the value we are able to realize as we seek to sell Noden as part of our asset monetization strategy.\nOur products may develop undesirable side effects or have other properties impacting safety or efficacy.\nUndesirable side effects caused by our products or similar products sold or developed by other companies, could reveal a high and unacceptable severity and prevalence of side effects or adverse events resulting in a number of potentially significant negative consequences, including:\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may withdraw approvals of such product;\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may require additional warnings on the label;\n\u2022\nwe may be required to create a medication guide outlining the risks of such side effects for distribution to patients;\n\u2022\nwe could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients; and\n\u2022\nour reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could result in a material decline of our revenue negatively affecting the value of our assets and the proceeds we realize from a sale of such assets as part of our monetization strategy.\nWe may have significant product liability exposure and our insurance may not cover all potential claims.\nWe are exposed to product liability and other claims in the event that our technologies or products are alleged to have caused harm. Any potential product liability claims could exceed the amount of our insurance coverage or may be excluded from coverage under the terms of our policies. Our insurance may not be renewed at a cost and level of coverage comparable to that then in effect. Any of these events could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, as well as the ability to successfully execute our monetization strategy.\nOur third-party contractors as well as our own employees may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements, which could result in significant liability for us and harm our reputation.\nWe are exposed to the risk of fraud or other misconduct in connection with international business operations and our reliance on third-party contractors to manage and conduct those activities with respect to our products. These risks include potential failures to:\n\u2022\ncomply with FDA regulations or similar regulations of comparable foreign regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\nprovide accurate information to the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\ncomply with manufacturing standards applicable to our products;\n\u2022\ncomply with federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations and similar laws and regulations established and enforced by comparable foreign regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\ncomply with the FCPA, the UK Bribery Act, and other anti-bribery laws;\n\u2022\nreport financial information or data and our business affairs accurately; or\n\u2022\ndisclose unauthorized activities to us.\nOur investment in Noden, an Irish entity, subjects us to both United States and international tax laws with respect to the structure and operations of our business and the business conducted by Noden, which are subject to continued scrutiny and change by governments and may result in additional liabilities that may affect our results of operations or reduce the proceeds we are able to realize as we seek to sell Noden or its assets as part of our monetization strategy.\nNoden is incorporated in Ireland and maintains the performance of certain functions and ownership of certain assets in a more tax-efficient jurisdiction than the United States. Taxing authorities, such as the United States Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d),\nactively audit and otherwise challenge these types of arrangements, and have regularly done so in the pharmaceutical industry. We remain subject to reviews and audits by the IRS and other taxing authorities from time to time, and the IRS or other taxing authority may challenge our structure and intra-company arrangements through an audit or lawsuit. Responding to or defending against those and other challenges from taxing authorities could be expensive and, in any event, would consume time and other resources, and divert management\u2019s time and focus, as well as restrict or delay our ability to sell Noden. We generally cannot predict whether taxing authorities will conduct an audit or file a lawsuit challenging our current structure, the cost involved in responding to any inquiry or audit or lawsuit, or the outcome. If we are unsuccessful, we may be required to consolidate income and pay greater taxes as well as interest, fines or penalties, and may be obligated to pay increased taxes in the future, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or the proceeds we are able to realize from a sale of Noden.\nThe regulatory clearance and approval processes of the FDA are lengthy, time-consuming and inherently unpredictable, and if we are ultimately unable to obtain regulatory clearance or approval for any new product candidates or modifications to existing products, our business or monetization strategy could be harmed.\nThe time required to obtain approval or clearance of a drug or device, respectively, by the FDA is unpredictable but typically takes many years following the commencement of clinical trials, if required, and depends upon numerous factors, including the substantial discretion of the regulatory authorities. In addition, approval or clearance policies, regulations, or the type and amount of clinical data necessary to gain marketing authorization may change during the course of a product candidate\u2019s development and may vary among jurisdictions. We are not permitted to market any new product candidates in the United States until we receive regulatory approval of an NDA for any new drug product candidate or clearance of a 510(k) premarket notification (or approval of a PMA application) for any new medical device from the FDA, unless the device is exempt from such requirements.\nPrior to obtaining approval to commercialize a drug product candidate in the United States or abroad, we or our collaborators must demonstrate with substantial evidence from well-controlled clinical trials, and to the satisfaction of the FDA, that such product candidates are safe and effective for their intended uses. Results from preclinical studies and clinical trials can be interpreted in different ways. Even if we believe the preclinical or clinical data for our product candidates are promising, such data may not be sufficient to support approval by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. The FDA may also require us to conduct additional preclinical studies or clinical trials for our product candidates either prior to or post-approval, or it may object to elements of our clinical development program.\nIn the United States, before we can market a new medical device, or a new use of, new claim for or significant modification to an existing product, we must first receive either clearance under Section 510(k) of the FFDCA or approval of a PMA application from the FDA, unless an exemption applies. In the 510(k) clearance process, before a device may be marketed, the FDA must determine that a proposed device is \u201csubstantially equivalent\u201d to a legally-marketed \u201cpredicate\u201d device, which includes a device that has been previously cleared through the 510(k) process, a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976 (pre-amendments device), a device that was originally on the U.S. market pursuant to an approved PMA and later down-classified, or a 510(k)-exempt device. To be \u201csubstantially equivalent,\u201d the proposed device must have the same intended use as the predicate device, and either have the same technological characteristics as the predicate device or have different technological characteristics and not raise different questions of safety or effectiveness than the predicate device. Clinical data are sometimes required to support substantial equivalence. In the PMA process, the FDA must determine that a proposed device is safe and effective for its intended use based, in part, on extensive data, including, but not limited to, technical, pre-clinical, clinical trial, manufacturing and labeling data. The PMA process is typically required for devices that are deemed to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices.\nModifications to products that are approved through a PMA application generally require FDA approval. Similarly, certain modifications made to products cleared through a 510(k) may require a new 510(k) clearance. Both the PMA approval and the 510(k) clearance process can be expensive, lengthy and uncertain. The FDA\u2019s 510(k) clearance process usually takes from three to 12 months, but can last longer. The process of obtaining a PMA is much costlier and more uncertain than the 510(k) clearance process and generally takes from one to three years, or even longer, from the time the application is filed with the FDA. In addition, a PMA generally requires the performance of one or more clinical trials. Despite the time, effort and cost, we cannot assure you that any particular device will be approved or cleared by the FDA. Any delay or failure to obtain necessary regulatory approvals could harm our business or monetization strategy.\nIn the United States, we have obtained 510(k) premarket clearance from the FDA to market the LENSAR device. An element of our strategy is to continue to add new features and seek new indications. We expect that any such modifications may require new 510(k) clearance; however, future modifications may be subject to the substantially more costly, time-consuming and uncertain PMA process. If the FDA requires us to go through a lengthier, more rigorous examination for future products or modifications to\nexisting products than we had expected, product introductions or modifications could be delayed or canceled, which could cause our sales to decline.\nThe FDA can delay, limit or deny clearance or approval of our product candidates or require us to conduct additional preclinical or clinical testing or abandon a program for many reasons, including:\n\u2022\nthe FDA\u2019s disagreement with the design or implementation of our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nnegative or ambiguous results from our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nresults that may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the FDA for approval or clearance;\n\u2022\nserious and unexpected drug-related adverse events experienced by participants in our clinical trials or by individuals using drugs similar to our product candidates;\n\u2022\nour inability to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA that our product candidates are safe and effective for the proposed indication or, in the case of our medical devices, are substantially equivalent to our proposed predicate device;\n\u2022\nthe FDA\u2019s disagreement with the interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u2022\nour inability to demonstrate that the clinical and other benefits of our product candidates outweigh any safety or other perceived risks;\n\u2022\nthe FDA\u2019s requirement for additional preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe FDA\u2019s disagreement regarding the formulation, labeling or the specifications of our product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe FDA\u2019s agency\u2019s failure to approve the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we contract; or\n\u2022\nthe potential for approval policies or regulations of the FDA to significantly change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval.\nOf the large number of products in development, only a small percentage successfully complete the FDA marketing authorization process and become commercialized. The lengthy process as well as the unpredictability of outcomes from future clinical trials may result in our failing to obtain regulatory authorization to market our product candidates.\nEven if we eventually complete clinical testing and receive approval of an NDA, 510(k), or similar foreign marketing application for our product candidates, the FDA may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly additional clinical trials, including Phase 4 clinical trials, or in the case of our drugs, the implementation of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (\u201cREMS\u201d), which may be required to ensure safe use of the drug after approval. The FDA also may authorize a product candidate for a more limited indication or patient population than we originally requested, and the FDA may not authorize us to market the product with the labeling that we believe is necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of a product candidate. Any delay in obtaining, or inability to obtain, applicable regulatory authorization would delay or prevent commercialization of that product candidate. In addition, our drugs may become subject to class-wide REMS that implicate all manufactures of a particular class of drugs, which could significantly impact our ability to commercialize our drugs and could reduce their market potential.\nThe safety and efficacy of our medical device products is not yet supported by long-term clinical data, which could limit sales, and our products might therefore prove to be less safe or effective than initially thought.\nOur medical device products have received premarket clearance under Section 510(k) of the FFDCA. In the 510(k) clearance process, before a device may be marketed the FDA must determine that a proposed device is \u201csubstantially equivalent\u201d to a legally-marketed \u201cpredicate\u201d device, which includes a device that has been previously cleared through the 510(k) process, a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976 (pre-amendments device), a device that was originally on the U.S. market pursuant to an approved PMA application and later down-classified, or a 510(k)-exempt device. This process is typically shorter and generally requires the submission of less supporting documentation than the FDA\u2019s PMA application process and does not always require long-term clinical studies.\nIn the European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d) manufacturers of medical devices are required by the Medical Devices Directive to collect post-marketing clinical data in relation to their CE marked medical devices. Post-market surveillance includes the conduct of post-market clinical follow-up studies permitting manufacturers to gather information concerning quality, safety or performance of medical devices after they have been placed on the market in the EEA. All information collected as part of the post-market surveillance process must be reviewed, investigated and analyzed on a regular basis in order to determine whether trending conclusions can be made concerning the safety or performance of the medical device and decisions must be taken in relation to the continued marketing of medical devices currently on the market. If development of these products is continued by\nus, we would expect to incur ongoing costs to comply with these post-market clinical obligations in EEA markets for so long as we continue to market and sell products in those markets.\nGiven the foregoing regulatory environment in which we operate, we lack the breadth of published long-term clinical data supporting the safety and efficacy of our medical devices and the benefits they offer that might have been generated in connection with other approval processes. For these reasons, the market may be slow to adopt our products, we may not have comparative data that our competitors have or are generating, and we may be subject to greater regulatory and product liability risks.\nIn addition, while our LENSAR\u00ae Laser Systems were first cleared in 2010 in the United States and in 2013 in EEA, we have limited complication or patient success rate data with respect to uses of our products. In addition, if future studies and experience indicate that our products cause unexpected or serious complications or other unforeseen negative effects, we could be subject to mandatory product recalls or suspension or withdrawal of clearance in the United States or the EEA, and our reputation with physicians, patients and healthcare providers may suffer.\nThe misuse or off-label use of our products may harm our reputation in the marketplace, result in injuries that lead to product liability suits or result in costly investigations, fines or sanctions by regulatory bodies if we are deemed to have engaged in the promotion of these uses, any of which could be costly to our business.\nOur products have been approved or cleared by the FDA for specific indications. Our marketing does not promote our products for uses outside of these cleared or approved indications for use, known as \u201coff-label uses.\u201d We cannot, however, prevent a physician from using or prescribing our products off-label, when in the physician\u2019s independent professional medical judgment he or she deems it appropriate. There may be increased risk of injury to patients if physicians prescribe or use our products off-label. Furthermore, the use of our products for indications other than those cleared or approved by the FDA or any foreign regulatory body may not effectively treat such conditions, which could harm our reputation in the marketplace among physicians and patients.\nIf the FDA or any foreign regulatory body determines that our promotional materials or training constitute promotion of an off-label use, it could request that we modify our training or promotional materials or subject us to regulatory or enforcement actions, including the issuance or imposition of a warning letter or an untitled letter, which is used for violators that do not necessitate a warning letter, injunction, seizure, civil fine or criminal penalties. It is also possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action under other regulatory authority, such as false claims laws, if they consider our business activities to constitute promotion of an off-label use, which could result in significant penalties, including, but not limited to, criminal, civil and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs and the curtailment of our operations.\nMoreover, if our products do not comply with regulatory requirements, including with respect to labeling and promotion, or are misused or used with improper technique, we may become subject to costly litigation. Product liability claims could divert management\u2019s attention from our core business, be expensive to defend and result in sizeable damage awards against us that may not be covered by insurance. In addition, any of the events described above could harm our business and/or negatively affect our ability to monetize such assets or the value we may receive from such a monetization.\nEven though we have received regulatory approval for our drug product candidates and clearance of a premarket notification for our devices, we are subject to ongoing regulatory obligations and continued regulatory review, which results in significant additional expense, and we may be subject to penalties, if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or experience unanticipated problems with our product candidates.\nAny regulatory approvals or clearances that we receive may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or the conditions of approval, or contain requirements for potentially costly post-market testing and surveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of the product candidate. The FDA may also require a REMS as a condition of approval of our product candidates, which could include requirements for a medication guide, physician communication plans or additional elements to ensure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools.\nIn addition, once the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority authorizes a product for marketing, the manufacturing processes, labeling, packaging, distribution, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion, import, export and recordkeeping are subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration, as well as continued compliance with cGMPs and GCP requirements for any clinical trials that we conduct post-approval. For example, we are subject to the medical device reporting requirements for our medical device products, which require us to report to the FDA when we receive or become aware of\ninformation that reasonably suggests that one or more of our medical devices may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that, if the malfunction were to recur, it could cause or contribute to a death or serious injury. The timing of our obligation to report is triggered by the date we become aware of the adverse event as well as the nature of the event. We may fail to report adverse events of which we become aware within the prescribed timeframe. We may also fail to recognize that we have become aware of a reportable adverse event, especially if it is not reported to us as an adverse event or if it is an adverse event that is unexpected or removed in time from the use of the product. If we fail to comply with our reporting obligations, the FDA could take enforcement action against us. We are subject to similar post-market reporting requirements with respect to our drug products.\nLater discovery of previously unknown problems with our product candidates, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with our third-party manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in, among other things:\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of our product candidates, withdrawal of the product from the market, or voluntary or mandatory product recalls;\n\u2022\nfines, warning letters or holds on clinical trials;\n\u2022\nrefusal by the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us or suspension or revocation of approvals;\n\u2022\nproduct seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of our product candidates; and\n\u2022\ninjunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nThe FDA\u2019s and other regulatory authorities\u2019 policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could impact our business. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may fail to obtain any marketing approvals, lose any marketing approval that we have obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe also cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad. For example, certain policies of the Trump administration may impact our business and industry. Namely, the Trump administration has taken several executive actions, including the issuance of a number of Executive Orders, that could impose significant burdens on, or otherwise materially delay, the FDA\u2019s ability to engage in routine regulatory and oversight activities such as implementing statutes through rulemaking, issuance of guidance, and review and approval of marketing applications. If these executive actions impose constraints on FDA\u2019s ability to engage in oversight and implementation activities in the normal course, our business may be negatively impacted.\nWe are subject to extensive healthcare laws, regulation and enforcement, and our failure to comply with those laws could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to potential risk of civil and criminal enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments due to the acquisitions of Noden and LENSAR. Our business practices and relationships with providers are subject to scrutiny under these laws. We are also be subject to privacy and security regulation related to patient, customer, employee and other third-party information by both the federal government and the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. The laws, regulations and codes that may affect us in the United States include:\n\u2022\nthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce, or in return for, the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. The U.S. government has interpreted this law broadly to apply to the marketing and sales activities of manufacturers. Moreover, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. Violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute may result in civil monetary penalties plus up to three times the remuneration involved. Civil penalties for such conduct can further be assessed under the federal False Claims Act. Violations can also result in criminal penalties and imprisonment of up to 10 years. Similarly, violations can result in exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid;\n\u2022\nfederal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent. Private individuals can bring False Claims Act \u2018\u2018qui tam\u2019\u2019 actions, on behalf of the government and such individuals, commonly known as \u2018\u2018whistleblowers,\u2019\u2019 may share in amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. When an entity is determined to have violated the federal civil False Claims Act, the government may impose civil fines and penalties for each false claim, plus treble damages, and exclude the entity from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs;\n\u2022\nthe federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which prohibits, among other things, offering or transferring remuneration to a federal healthcare beneficiary that a person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary\u2019s decision to order or receive items or services reimbursable by the government from a particular provider or supplier;\n\u2022\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\u201cHIPAA\u201d), which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and making false statements relating to healthcare matters. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation;\n\u2022\nHIPAA, as amended by the Health Information for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (\u201cHITECH\u201d), and its implementing regulations, which imposes certain requirements on certain covered healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses as well as their business associates that perform services for them that involve individually identifiable health information, relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information, without appropriate authorization, including mandatory contractual terms as well as directly applicable privacy and security standards and requirements. Failure to comply with the HIPAA privacy and security standards can result in civil monetary penalties for each violation and, in certain circumstances, criminal penalties with fines for each violation and/or imprisonment. State attorneys general can also bring a civil action to enjoin a HIPAA violation or to obtain statutory damages on behalf of residents of his or her state;\n\u2022\nthe federal physician sunshine requirements under the ACA, which require manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies to report annually to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\u201cCMS\u201d), information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians, other healthcare providers, and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and other healthcare providers and their immediate family members. Applicable manufacturers are required to submit annual reports to CMS. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately, and completely reported in an annual submission, and may result in liability under other federal laws or regulations;\n\u2022\nguidelines promulgated by the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services related to pharmaceutical and medical device company regulatory compliance programs and the PhRMA Code on Interactions with Healthcare Professionals and the AdvaMed Code of Ethics, as amended;\n\u2022\nforeign and state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as the FCPA, anti-kickback and false claims laws that may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers;\n\u2022\nstate laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources;\n\u2022\nstate laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and\n\u2022\nstate laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nThese laws and regulations, among other things, constrain our business, marketing and other promotional activities by limiting the kinds of financial arrangements, including sales programs, we may have with hospitals, physicians or other potential purchasers of our products. Due to the breadth of these laws, the narrowness of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors available, and the range of interpretations to which they are subject, it is possible that some of our current or future practices might be challenged under one or more of these laws.\nTo enforce compliance with the healthcare regulatory laws, certain enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. Responding to investigations can be time-and resource-consuming and can divert management\u2019s attention from the business. Additionally, as a result of these investigations, healthcare providers and entities may have to agree to additional compliance and reporting requirements as part of a consent decree or corporate integrity\nagreement. Any such investigation or settlement could increase our costs or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business. Even an unsuccessful challenge or investigation into our practices could cause adverse publicity and be costly to respond to.\nWe do not have experience in establishing the compliance programs necessary to comply with this complex and evolving regulatory environment and our reliance on Noden and LENSAR to operate and address these requirements appropriately increases the risks that we may be found to violate the applicable laws and regulations. If we are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations, we may be subject to penalties, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, imprisonment, contractual damages, reputational harm, disgorgement and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could materially and adversely affect interests in our products, including having a material adverse effect on our financial results or our ability to monetize such products or related businesses as part of our monetization strategy.\nAn impairment charge with respect to intangible assets could have a material impact on our results of operations and/or negatively affect our monetization strategy.\nWe periodically evaluate our intangible assets to determine whether all or a portion of their carrying values may be impaired, in which case a charge to earnings may be necessary. The occurrence of certain events, changes in business strategy, government regulations or economic or market conditions may cause us to remeasure the fair value of certain assets and liabilities. Our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on, among other things, legal factors, market conditions, and operational performance. If an event or events occur that would cause us to revise our estimates and assumptions used in analyzing the value of our intangible assets, such revision could result in an impairment charge that could have a material impact on our results of operations in the period in which the impairment occurs. For example, at December 31, 2019, we recorded an impairment charge of $22.5 million for the Noden intangible assets related to our monetization strategy and updated forecasts for Noden. As a result of this impairment charge, which was based on the estimated fair value of the assets, the remaining carrying value of these intangible assets were determined to be $10.1 million. For additional information on the impairment charge, see Note 10, Intangible Assets.\nWe may use a certain amount of cash from time to time in order to repurchase or satisfy obligations relating to our convertible notes. The maturity or conversion of any of our convertible notes could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are required to repay the full principal amount of approximately $19.2 million in principal amount outstanding under the 2.75% Convertible Senior Notes due December 1, 2021 (the \u201cDecember 2021 Notes\u201d) and approximately $11.5 million in principal amount outstanding plus an additional accreted amount of $1.5 million under the 2.75% Convertible Senior Notes due December 1, 2024 (the \u201cDecember 2024 Notes\u201d) if not previously converted or repurchased.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on, to pay any cash due upon conversion of, or to refinance, our indebtedness, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other\nfactors beyond our control. Our business may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations.\nHolders of the December 2021 Notes may convert their notes at their option under the following conditions at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding June 1, 2021: (i) during any fiscal quarter (and only during such fiscal quarter) commencing after the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2017, if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive), in the period of 30 consecutive trading days, ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter, exceeds 130% of the conversion price for the notes on each applicable trading day; (ii) during the five business day period immediately after any five consecutive trading-day period (the measurement period), in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of the December 2021 Notes for each trading day of that measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate for the notes for each such trading day; or (iii) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. Holders of the December 2024 Notes may convert their notes at their option under the following conditions at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding June 1, 2024: (i) during any fiscal quarter (and only during such fiscal quarter) if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive), in the period of 30 consecutive trading days, ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter, exceeds 130% of the\nconversion price for the notes on each applicable trading day; (ii) during the five business day period immediately after any five consecutive trading-day period (the measurement period), in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of the December 2024 Notes for each trading day of that measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate for the notes for each such trading day; or (iii) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events.\nThe December 2021 Notes and the December 2024 Notes may be settled by paying or delivering, as applicable, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election. During the year ended December 31, 2019 we repurchased approximately $44.8 million in principal amount of our December 2021 Notes and approximately $74.6 million in principal amount of our December 2024 Notes. In furtherance of our monetization strategy, we expect to use a certain amount of cash from time to time in order to repurchase or satisfy obligations relating to our convertible notes which could adversely affect the amount or timing of any distribution to our stockholders.\nThe conversion or any future exchanges of any of the December 2021 Notes or the December 2024 Notes into shares of our common stock would have a dilutive effect that could cause our stock price to go down.\nUntil June 1, 2021, the December 2021 Notes are convertible into shares of our common stock only if specified conditions are met and thereafter convertible at any time, at the option of the holder. Until June 1, 2024, the December 2024 Notes are convertible into shares of our common stock only if specified conditions are met and thereafter convertible at any time, at the option of the holder. We have reserved shares of our authorized common stock for issuance upon conversion of the December 2021 Notes and the December 2024 Notes. Upon conversion, the principal amount of our convertible notes may be settled in, at our option, cash, common stock or a combination of cash and common stock. If any or all of these convertible notes are converted into shares of our common stock, our existing stockholders will experience immediate dilution of voting rights and our common stock price may decline. Furthermore, the perception that such dilution could occur may cause the market price of our common stock to decline. If our stock price is negatively impacted, any value we may receive upon the potential sale of our company or other potential transaction in furtherance of our monetization strategy could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe entered into capped call transactions in connection with the issuance of our December 2021 Notes and our December 2024 Notes that may affect the value of our common stock and any desired dilution mitigation will be limited to the extent that our stock price rises above the cap price of the applicable capped call transactions.\nIn connection with the issuance of our December 2021 Notes and our December 2024 Notes, we entered into capped call transactions, with hedge counterparties, which we expect to reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the December 2021 Notes and the December 2024 Notes in the event that the market price per share of our common stock, as measured under the terms of the applicable capped call transaction, at the time of exercise is greater than the strike price of the applicable capped call transaction, which corresponds to the initial conversion price of the applicable notes and is subject to certain adjustments similar to those contained in the applicable notes. If, however, the market price per share of our common stock, as measured under the terms of the applicable capped call transaction, exceeds the cap price of the applicable capped call transaction, there would nevertheless be dilution to the extent that such market price exceeds the cap price of the applicable capped call transaction.\nIn connection with hedging the capped call transactions, the hedge counterparties or their affiliates:\n\u2022\nexpect to purchase our common stock in the open market and/or enter into various derivatives and/or enter into various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock; and\n\u2022\nmay enter into or unwind various derivatives and/or purchase or sell our common stock in secondary market transactions.\nThese activities could have the effect of increasing or preventing a decline in the price of our common stock concurrently with or following the pricing of the applicable notes and could have the effect of decreasing the price of our common stock during the period immediately prior to a conversion of the applicable notes.\nThe hedge counterparties or their affiliates are likely to modify their hedge positions in relation to the capped call transactions from time to time prior to conversion or maturity of the applicable notes by purchasing and selling our common stock, other of our securities, or other instruments they may wish to use in connection with such hedging.\nIn addition, we intend to exercise options we hold under the capped call transaction whenever the notes are converted. In order to unwind its hedge positions with respect to those exercised options, the counterparties or affiliates thereof expect to sell our common stock in secondary market transactions or unwind various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock during the period immediately prior to conversion of the applicable notes. We have also agreed to indemnify the hedge\ncounterparties and affiliates thereof for losses incurred in connection with a potential unwinding of their hedge positions under certain circumstances.\nThe effect, if any, of any of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time, but any of these activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock. For further information regarding the mechanics of our capped call transactions, refer to our discussion in Note 13, Convertible Senior Notes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe have implemented a corporate structure taking into consideration our limited operations and potentially applicable tax impact on our royalty and other income, and any changes in applicable tax laws and regulations or enforcement positions of tax authorities may negatively impact our financial condition and operating results.\nWe have established our corporate structure to be closely aligned with the financial nature of our business. There can be no assurance that the applicable tax laws and regulations will continue in effect or that the taxing authorities in any or all of the applicable jurisdictions will not challenge one or more aspects or characterizations of our corporate structure and the treatment of transactions or agreements within our corporate structure, or determine that the manner in which we operate our business is not consistent with our corporate structure. For example, recently enacted U.S. tax legislation may result in an increased tax liability as a result of our current corporate structure. We may also have disputes with one or more state tax authorities regarding whether we are subject to that state\u2019s tax and, if we are subject to such state\u2019s tax, what proportion of our revenues is subject to taxation in such state. For example, we are currently subject to an audit by the California Franchise Tax Board and, while we may disagree with their conclusions regarding such issues, the proceedings may extend over a long period of time and we may ultimately be required to pay taxes either in a settlement or upon a final decision of an agency or court. In addition, an inability to resolve our audit with the Franchise Tax Board in a satisfactory manner without extensive legal proceedings may result in an extended period of operation prior to wind-down or dissolution. Any unfavorable changes in laws and regulations or positions by tax authorities could harm our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may have exposure to additional tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to taxes in the United States and other jurisdictions. Tax rates in these jurisdictions may be subject to significant change due to economic and/or political conditions. A number of other factors may also impact our future effective tax rate including:\n\u2022\nthe jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed;\n\u2022\nthe resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities;\n\u2022\nchanges in valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;\n\u2022\nincreases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including write-offs of acquired intangibles and impairment of goodwill in connection with acquisitions;\n\u2022\nchanges in availability of tax credits, tax holidays, and tax deductions;\n\u2022\nchanges in share-based compensation; and\n\u2022\nchanges in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws and changes in generally accepted accounting principles.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. federal government enacted the 2017 Tax Act. The 2017 Tax Act significantly changed the existing U.S. corporate income tax laws by, among other things, lowering the corporate tax rate (from a top rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21%), implementing elements of a territorial tax system, and imposing a one-time deemed repatriation transition tax on cumulative undistributed foreign earnings, for which we have not previously paid U.S. taxes. The Company recognized in its Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2017 estimated tax impacts related to the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. The ultimate impact did not differ materially from these provisional amounts after additional analysis, changes in interpretations and assumptions the Company made and additional regulatory guidance that was issued. The accounting was completed when the Company\u2019s 2017 U.S. corporate income tax return was filed in 2018. We have made a policy election with respect to our treatment of potential GILTI to account for taxes on GILTI as a current-period expense as incurred.\nIn addition, certain activities conducted by our foreign subsidiaries may give rise to United States corporate income tax, even if there are no distributions to the United States. These taxes would be imposed on us when our subsidiaries that are controlled foreign corporations generate income that is subject to Subpart F of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (\u201cSubpart F\u201d) or Global intangible low-taxed income (\u201cGILTI\u201d). Passive income, such as rents, royalties, interest and dividends, is among the types of income subject to taxation under Subpart F. Any income taxable under Subpart F or GILTI is taxable in the United States at federal corporate income tax rates of 21%. Subpart F income that is taxable to us, even if it is not distributed to us, may also include income from intercompany transactions between our U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries, or where our non-U.S. subsidiaries\nmake an \u201cinvestment in U.S. property,\u201d within the meaning of Subpart F, such as holding the stock in, or making a loan to, a U.S. corporation.\nWhile we may mitigate this increase in our effective tax rate through claiming a foreign tax credit against our U.S. federal income taxes or potentially have foreign or U.S. taxes reduced under applicable income tax treaties, we are subject to various limitations on claiming foreign tax credits and we may lack treaty protections in certain jurisdictions that will potentially limit any reduction of the increased effective tax rate. A higher effective tax rate may also result to the extent that losses are incurred in non-U.S. subsidiaries that do not reduce our U.S. taxable income.\nOur ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nAt December 31, 2019, we had federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $108.6 million, $63.9 million and $125.6 million, respectively, and federal and state tax credit carryforwards of $2.2 million and $19.3 million, respectively. There may be limitations on our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards or other tax assets. For example, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d (generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period), the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income may be limited. We or our subsidiaries may have experienced, or may in the future experience, \u201cownership changes\u201d as a result of shifts in stock ownership. Tax attributes acquired from LENSAR may be subject to separate return limitations that may limit the corporation\u2019s ability to use the acquired net operating losses and credits. Any limitations on our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax assets could materially and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, under the 2017 Tax Act, although the treatment of tax losses generated in taxable years ending before December 31, 2017 has generally not changed, tax losses generated in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 may only be utilized to offset 80% of taxable income annually. This change may require us to pay additional federal income taxes in future years.\nWe depend on our licensees and royalty-agreement counterparties for the determination of royalty payments. While we have rights to audit our licensees and royalty-agreement counterparties, the independent auditors may have difficulty determining the correct royalty calculation, we may not be able to detect errors and payment calculations may call for retroactive adjustments. We may have to exercise legal remedies to resolve any disputes resulting from the audit or otherwise related to non-performance by a licensee or royalty counterparty.\nThe royalty payments we receive are determined by our licensees based on their reported sales. Each licensee\u2019s calculation of the royalty payments is subject to and dependent upon the adequacy and accuracy of its sales and accounting functions, and errors may occur from time to time in the calculations made by a licensee. Our license and royalty agreements provide us the right to audit the calculations and sales data for the associated royalty payments; however, our right to conduct such audits may be limited in terms of the covered periods, and such audits may occur many months following our recognition of the royalty revenue, may require us to adjust our royalty revenues in later periods and may require incurring additional expenses on our part. Further, our licensees and royalty-agreement counterparties may be uncooperative or have insufficient records, which may complicate and delay the audit process.\nAlthough we regularly exercise our royalty audit rights, and reference publicly available information in the assessment of the paid royalties, we rely in the first instance on our licensees and royalty-agreement counterparties to accurately report sales and calculate and pay applicable royalties and, upon exercise of such royalty audit rights, we rely on licensees\u2019 and royalty-agreement counterparties\u2019 cooperation in performing such audits. In the absence of such cooperation, we may be forced to exercise legal remedies to enforce our agreements.\nWe may experience increases and decreases in our revenues due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and we may be unsuccessful in our attempts to mitigate this risk.\nOur operating results are subject to volatility due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Our primary exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relates to revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fluctuations in foreign currency rates, particularly the Euro, relative to the U.S. dollar can significantly affect our revenues and operating results. While foreign currency conversion terms vary by license agreement, generally most agreements require that royalties first be calculated in the currency of sale and then converted into U.S. dollars using the average daily exchange rates for that currency for a specified period at the end of the calendar quarter. For example, when the U.S. dollar weakens in relation to other currencies, the converted amount is greater than it would have been had the U.S. dollar exchange rates remained unchanged. Our revenues may fluctuate due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and is subject to foreign currency exchange risk.\nTo compensate for Euro currency fluctuations, we may hedge Euro currency exposures with Euro forward and option contracts, to offset the risks associated with these Euro currency exposures. We may suspend the use of these contracts from time to time or we may be unsuccessful in our attempt to hedge our Euro currency risk. We will continue to experience foreign currency related fluctuations in our royalty revenues in certain instances when we do not enter into foreign currency exchange contracts or where it is not possible or cost effective to hedge our foreign currency related exposures. Currency related fluctuations in our royalty revenues will vary based on the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, whether we have entered into foreign currency exchange contracts to offset these exposures and other factors. All of these factors could materially impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flows, the timing of which is variable and generally outside of our control.\nLegislative or regulatory reforms in the United States or the EU may make it more difficult and costly for us to obtain regulatory clearances or approvals for our medical device products or to manufacture, market or distribute our products after clearance or approval is obtained.\nFrom time to time, legislation is drafted and introduced in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the regulation of medical devices. In addition, the FDA may change its clearance and approval policies, adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations, or take other actions, which may prevent or delay approval or clearance of our future products under development or impact our ability to modify our currently cleared products on a timely basis. Over the last several years, the FDA has proposed reforms to its 510(k) clearance process, and such proposals could include increased requirements for clinical data and a longer review period, or could make it more difficult for manufacturers to utilize the 510(k) clearance process for their products. For example, in November 2018, FDA officials announced forthcoming steps that the FDA intends to take to modernize the premarket notification pathway under Section 510(k) of the FFDCA. Among other things, the FDA announced that it planned to develop proposals to drive manufacturers utilizing the 510(k) pathway toward the use of newer predicates. These proposals included plans to potentially sunset certain older devices that were used as predicates under the 510(k) clearance pathway, and to potentially publish a list of devices that have been cleared on the basis of demonstrated substantial equivalence to predicate devices that are more than 10 years old. In May 2019, the FDA solicited public feedback on these proposals. These proposals have not yet been finalized or adopted, and the FDA may work with Congress to implement such proposals through legislation. Accordingly, it is unclear the extent to which any proposals, if adopted, could impose additional regulatory requirements on us that could delay our ability to obtain new 510(k) clearances, increase the costs of compliance, or restrict our ability to maintain our current clearances, or otherwise create competition that may negatively affect our business or monetization strategy.\nMore recently, in September 2019, the FDA finalized guidance describing an optional \u201csafety and performance based\u201d premarket review pathway for manufacturers of \u201ccertain, well-understood device types\u201d to demonstrate substantial equivalence under the 510(k) clearance pathway by showing that such device meets objective safety and performance criteria established by the FDA, thereby obviating the need for manufacturers to compare the safety and performance of their medical devices to specific predicate devices in the clearance process. The FDA intends to develop and maintain a list of device types appropriate for the \u201csafety and performance based\u201d pathway and will continue to develop product-specific guidance documents that identify the performance criteria for each such device type, as well as the testing methods recommended in the guidance documents, where feasible. The FDA may establish performance criteria for classes of devices for which we or our competitors seek or currently have received clearance, and it is unclear the extent to which such performance standards, if established, could impact our ability to obtain new 510(k) clearances or otherwise create competition that may negatively affect our business or monetization strategy.\nIn addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the FDA in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. Any new statutes, regulations or revisions or reinterpretations of existing regulations may impose additional costs or lengthen review times of any future products or make it more difficult to obtain clearance or approval for, manufacture, market or distribute our products. We cannot determine what effect changes in regulations, statutes, legal interpretation or policies, when and if promulgated, enacted or adopted may have on our business in the future. Such changes could, among other things, require: additional testing prior to obtaining clearance or approval; changes to manufacturing methods; recall, replacement or discontinuance of our products; or additional record keeping.\nOn April 5, 2017, the European Parliament passed the Medical Devices Regulation (Regulation 2017/745), which repeals and replaces the EU Medical Devices Directive and the Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive. Unlike directives, which must be implemented into the national laws of the EEA member states, the regulations would be directly applicable, i.e., without the need for adoption of EEA member state laws implementing them, in all EEA member states and are intended to eliminate current differences in the regulation of medical devices among EEA member States. The Medical Devices Regulation, among other\nthings, is intended to establish a uniform, transparent, predictable and sustainable regulatory framework across the EEA for medical devices and ensure a high level of safety and health while supporting innovation.\nThe Medical Devices Regulation will, however, only become applicable three years after publication (in 2020). Once applicable, the new regulations will among other things:\n\u2022\nstrengthen the rules on placing devices on the market and reinforce surveillance once they are available;\n\u2022\nestablish explicit provisions on manufacturers\u2019 responsibilities for the follow-up of the quality, performance and safety of devices placed on the market;\n\u2022\nimprove the traceability of medical devices throughout the supply chain to the end-user or patient through a unique identification number;\n\u2022\nset up a central database to provide patients, healthcare professionals and the public with comprehensive information on products available in the EU;\n\u2022\nstrengthened rules for the assessment of certain high-risk devices, such as implants, which may have to undergo an additional check by experts before they are placed on the market.\nThese modifications may have an effect on the way we conduct our business in the EEA.\nOur agreements with Facet may not reflect terms that would have resulted from arm\u2019s-length negotiations between unaffiliated third parties.\nThe agreements associated with the spin-off of Facet in December 2008 (the \u201cSpin-Off\u201d), including the Separation and Distribution Agreement, Tax Sharing and Indemnification Agreement and Cross License Agreement, were negotiated in the context of the Spin-Off while Facet was still part of us and, accordingly, may not reflect more favorable terms that may have resulted from arm\u2019s-length negotiations between unaffiliated third parties.\nWe may have obligations for which we may not be able to collect under our indemnification rights from Facet.\nUnder the terms of the Separation and Distribution agreement with Facet, we and Facet agreed to indemnify the other from and after the Spin-Off with respect to certain indebtedness, liabilities and obligations that were retained by our respective companies. These indemnification obligations could be significant. The ability to satisfy these indemnities, if called upon to do so, will depend upon our future financial strength. We cannot assure you that, if Facet has to indemnify us for any substantial obligations, Facet will have the ability to satisfy those obligations. If Facet does not have the ability to satisfy those obligations, we may be required to satisfy those obligations instead. For example, in connection with the Spin-Off, we entered into amendments to the leases for the facilities in Redwood City, California, which formerly served as our corporate headquarters, under which Facet was added as a co-tenant under the leases and a Co-Tenancy Agreement under which Facet agreed to indemnify us for all matters related to the leases attributable to the period after the Spin-Off date. Should Facet default under its lease obligations, we would be held liable by the landlord as a co-tenant and, thus, we have in substance guaranteed the payments under the lease agreements for the Redwood City facilities, the disposition of which could have a material adverse effect on the amount or timing of any distribution to our stockholders. As of December 31, 2019, the total lease payments for the duration of the guarantee, which runs through December 2021, are approximately $22.6 million. We would also be responsible for lease-related payments including utilities, property taxes and common area maintenance that may be as much as the actual lease payments. In April 2010, Abbott Laboratories acquired Facet and renamed the company Abbott Biotherapeutics Corp., and in January 2013, Abbott Biotherapeutics Corp. was renamed AbbVie Biotherapeutics, Inc. and spun off from Abbott as a subsidiary of AbbVie Inc. We do not know how Abbott\u2019s acquisition of Facet will impact our ability to collect under our indemnification rights or whether Facet\u2019s ability to satisfy its obligations will change. In addition, we have limited information rights under the Co-Tenancy Agreement. As a result, we are unable to determine definitively whether Facet continues to occupy the space and whether it has subleased the space to another party or the basis upon which our potential co-tenant obligation may be triggered. See \u201cItem 2 - Properties.\u201d\nAs we continue to operate our business and as we implement our monetization strategy, our mix of assets and sources of income may require that we register with the SEC as an \u201cinvestment company\u201d in accordance with the Investment Company Act of 1940.\nWe are not registered and have no intention to register as an \u201cinvestment company\u201d under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the \u201c40 Act\u201d). As a result, we are not and do not expect to become subject to regulation under the 40 Act, including its reporting and corporate governance requirements and restrictions on leverage and affiliate transactions.\nGenerally, to avoid being regulated as an \u201cinvestment company\u201d under the 40 Act an issuer must:\n\u2022\nnot be engaged or hold itself out as being engaged primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities and not own or propose to acquire \u201cinvestment securities\u201d with a value of more than 40% of the value of its total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis; or\n\u2022\nbe able to rely on an exception from the definition of \u201cinvestment company\u201d under the \u201940 Act or an exemptive rule.\n\u201cInvestment securities\u201d are any securities other than U.S. government securities and securities issued by a majority-owned subsidiary that is not itself either an \u201cinvestment company\u201d or a private investment company, meaning a company that is excluded from the definition of \u201cinvestment company\u201d by Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) of the 40 Act.\nWe have in the past and may in the future rely on one or more exceptions to the definition of \u201cinvestment company\u201d under the 40 Act, including the exception under Section 3(c)(5) of the 40 Act. To rely on Section 3(c)(5), as interpreted by the staff of the SEC, we would be required to have at least 55% of our total assets in certain qualifying assets. In a no-action letter issued to Royalty Pharma on August 13, 2010, the SEC staff stated that certain royalty interests of the type we own can be treated as qualifying assets.\nEnsuring that we do not fall within the definition of \u201cinvestment company\u201d under the 40 Act may limit our ability to make certain investments (including divesting certain assets), or require us to take or forego certain actions, that could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation. In addition, if the SEC, its staff or the courts changes their interpretation of certain provisions of the 40 Act, including Section 3(c)(5), we may need to take additional steps in order to avoid becoming subject to regulation under the 40 Act, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation.\nIf we were required to register as an \u201cinvestment company,\u201d the obligations imposed on us by the 40 Act would likely require substantial changes in the way we do business and would result in significant additional regulatory and administrative burdens and costs. In order to remain outside the scope of regulation under the 40 Act, we may need to take various actions which we might otherwise not pursue. These actions may include restructuring our company and modifying our mixture of assets and income, including divesting certain desirable assets immediately, and could have a material and adverse effect on us.\nFailure in our information technology and storage systems could significantly disrupt the operation of our business.\nOur ability to execute our business plan depends, in part, on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) systems. IT systems are vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources, including telecommunications or network failures, malicious human acts and natural disasters. Moreover, despite network security and back-up measures, some of our servers may be vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses and similar disruptive problems. Despite the precautionary measures we have taken to prevent unanticipated problems that could affect our IT systems, sustained or repeated system failures that interrupt our ability to generate and maintain data could adversely affect our ability to operate our business.\nChanges to financial accounting standards may affect our reported results of operations.\nA change in accounting standards or practices can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective. New accounting pronouncements and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future. Changes to existing standards or the reevaluation of current practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business.\nWe use estimates, make judgments, and apply certain methods in measuring the progress of our business in determining our financial results and in applying our accounting policies. As these estimates, judgments, and methods change, our assessment of the progress of our business and our results of operations could vary.\nThe methods, estimates, and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of operations. Such methods, estimates, and judgments are, by their nature, subject to substantial risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, and factors may arise over time may lead us to change our methods, estimates, and judgments. Changes in any of our assumptions may adversely affect our reported financial results.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting in the future, we may not be able to accurately report our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal controls for financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. We are required, under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (\u201cSection 404\u201d), to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting that results in more than a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Section 404 also generally requires an attestation from our independent registered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\nOur compliance with Section 404 requires that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management efforts. Our acquired businesses may have limited experience complying with Section 404 and if in the future we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that there will not be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting in the future. Any failure to maintain internal control over financial reporting could severely inhibit our ability to accurately report our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. If our independent registered public accounting firm determines we have a material weakness or significant deficiency in our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our common stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by Nasdaq, the SEC or other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain other effective control systems required of public companies, could also restrict our future access to the capital markets.", "PERMNO": 77292, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "PDLI"}
