{"cik": "1328015", "company": "Imprivata Inc", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-11", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThese are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Because of the these factors, as well as other variables affecting our operating results, past financial performance should not be considered as a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. These risks are not the only ones facing us. Please also see \u201cSPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\u201d earlier in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion highlights certain risks which may affect future operating results. These are the risks and uncertainties we believe are most important for our existing and potential stockholders to consider. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, which we currently deem immaterial or which are similar to those faced by other companies in our industry or business in general, may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks or uncertainties actually occurs, our business, financial condition and operating results would likely suffer.\nRisks related to our business and industry\nWe have a history of losses, we expect to continue to incur losses and we may not be profitable in the future.\nWe incurred operating and net losses for the year ended December 31, 2014. As of December 31, 2014, we had an accumulated deficit of $107.6 million and we expect to continue to incur operating and net losses for the foreseeable future. Our ability to be profitable in the future depends upon continued demand for our authentication and access management solutions. In addition, our profitability will be affected by, among other things, our ability to develop and commercialize new solutions, and products for those solutions, and enhance existing solutions and products. Further market adoption of our solutions, including increased penetration within our existing customers, depends upon our ability to improve clinical workflows related to the utilization of healthcare information technology systems and increase clinician productivity. We expect to incur significant operating costs relating to our research and development initiatives for our new and existing solutions and products, and for our expansion of our sales and marketing operations as we add additional sales personnel and increase our marketing efforts. Furthermore, we may incur significant losses in the future for a number of reasons, including the other risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown events. As a result, we cannot assure you that we will be able achieve or sustain profitability in the future.\nWe depend on sales of our Imprivata OneSign solution in the healthcare industry for a substantial portion of our revenue, and any decrease in its sales would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA substantial portion of our revenue has been derived from sales of our Imprivata OneSign solution to the healthcare industry. We anticipate that sales of our Imprivata OneSign solution to the healthcare industry will represent a significant portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future. Any decrease in revenue from sales of this solution would have a material adverse effect on our business. Healthcare organizations are currently facing significant budget constraints, increasing demands resulting from a growing number of patients, and impediments to obtaining third-party reimbursements and patient payments for their services. Although healthcare organizations are currently allocating funds for capital and infrastructure improvements to benefit from governmental initiatives, they may not choose to prioritize or implement access or authentication management solutions as part of those efforts at this time, or at all, due to financial and resource constraints. Even if clinicians determine that our Imprivata OneSign solution provides benefits over their existing authentication and access management solutions, their healthcare organizations may not have, or may not be willing to spend, the resources necessary to purchase, install and maintain information technology systems, adopt our Imprivata OneSign solution, add licensed users in other departments or purchase additional products and services from us.\nIn addition, our healthcare customers have been experiencing consolidation in response to developments generally affecting the healthcare industry. As a result, we may lose existing or potential healthcare customers for our solutions. If our existing customers combine with other healthcare organizations that are not our customers, they may reduce or discontinue their purchases of our solutions. In addition, the combined organizations may have greater leverage in negotiating terms with us, and we may be forced to accept terms that are less favorable to us.\nWe do not anticipate that sales of our solutions in non-healthcare industries will represent a significant portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future. As a result, decreased revenue from sales of our Imprivata OneSign solution in the healthcare industry would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to attract new customers and retain and increase sales to our existing customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success and growth strategy depends in part upon the purchase of our Imprivata OneSign solution by new customers. Our sales and marketing efforts seek to demonstrate to potential new customers that our solutions streamline clinician workflow and increase productivity, enhance the value of existing investments in healthcare information technology, and help ensure compliance with complex privacy and security regulations. If we are not able to persuade new customers that our solutions provide these benefits, or if we fail to generate sufficient sales leads through our marketing programs, then we will not be able to attract new customers, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn most cases, our customers initially license our solutions for a limited number of departments within a healthcare organization. After the initial sale, our customers frequently add licensed users in other departments, functional groups and sites and buy additional products and services over time. Factors that may affect our ability to retain and increase sales to our existing customers include the quality of our customer service, training and technology, as well as our ability to successfully develop and introduce new solutions and products. Additionally, our customers may stop using our Imprivata OneSign solution or may not renew agreements for services, including software maintenance, for reasons entirely out of our control, such as a reduction in their budgets. If our efforts to satisfy our existing customers are not successful, we may not be able to retain them or sell additional functionality to them, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to successfully develop and introduce new solutions and products for existing solutions, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur success depends, in part, upon our ability to anticipate industry evolution and introduce or acquire new solutions and products to keep pace with technological developments and market requirements both within our industry and in related industries. However, we may not be able to develop, introduce, acquire and integrate new solutions and products in response to our customers\u2019 changing requirements in a timely manner or on a cost-effective basis, or that sufficiently differentiate us from competing solutions such that customers choose to purchase our solutions. For example, healthcare organizations may shift their existing information technology infrastructure from on-site services to cloud-based services, which may not be compatible with our solutions, requiring us to develop new products or to re-engineer our existing products. In addition, healthcare organizations may adopt mobile applications more quickly than we have anticipated, requiring us to accelerate the development of a mobile version of our authentication and access management solutions. If any of our competitors\u2019 implements new technologies before we are able to implement them or better anticipates the innovation opportunities in related industries, those competitors may be able to provide more effective or more cost-effective solutions than ours. In addition, we may experience technical problems and additional costs as we introduce new solutions, deploy future iterations of our solutions and integrate new solutions with existing customer systems and workflows. If any of these problems were to arise, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nDevelopments in the healthcare industry or regulatory environment could adversely affect our business.\nOur growth strategy is focused on the healthcare industry and a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from the healthcare industry. This industry is highly regulated and is subject to changing political, legislative, regulatory and other influences. Developments generally affecting the healthcare industry, including new regulations or new interpretations of existing regulations, such as reductions in funding, changes in pricing for healthcare services or impediments to third-party reimbursement for healthcare costs, may cause deterioration in the financial or business condition of our customers and cause them to reduce their spending on information technology. As a result, these developments could adversely affect our business.\nIn March 2010, comprehensive healthcare reform legislation was enacted in the United States through the Patient Protection and Affordable Health Care for America Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act. This law is expected to increase health insurance coverage through individual and employer mandates, subsidies offered to lower income individuals, tax credits available to smaller employers and broadening of Medicaid eligibility, and to affect third-party reimbursement levels for healthcare organizations. We cannot predict what effect federal healthcare reform or any future legislation or regulation, or healthcare initiatives, if any, implemented at the state level, will have on us or our healthcare customers.\nIn addition, our healthcare customers\u2019 expectations regarding pending or potential industry developments may also affect their budgeting processes and spending plans with respect to our authentication and access management solutions. The healthcare industry has changed significantly in recent years and we expect that significant changes will continue to occur. However, the timing and impact of developments in the healthcare industry are difficult to predict. We cannot assure you that the markets for our solutions will continue to exist at current levels or that we will have adequate technical, financial and marketing resources to react to changes in those markets.\nSeasonal variations in the purchasing patterns of our customers may lead to fluctuations in our operating results and financial condition.\nWe have experienced and expect to continue to experience seasonal variations in the timing of customers\u2019 purchases of our solutions. Many customers make purchasing decisions based on their fiscal year budgets, which typically coincide with the calendar year and result in increased purchasing in the fourth quarter of the year. Because many of our expenses remain relatively fixed throughout the year, the seasonality of our business requires us to manage our working capital carefully over the course of the year. If we fail to manage our working capital effectively or do not accurately predict customer demand in the fourth quarter of the year, our operating results and financial condition may fluctuate.\nOur sales cycles for new customers can be lengthy and unpredictable, which may cause our revenue and operating results to fluctuate significantly.\nOur sales cycles for new customers can be lengthy and unpredictable. Our sales efforts involve educating our customers about the use and benefits of our authentication and access management solutions, including demonstrating the potential of our solutions in streamlining clinician workflow and increasing productivity. Customers may undertake a significant evaluation process, involving not only our solutions but also the customer\u2019s existing healthcare information technology infrastructure. This assessment can result in a lengthy and unpredictable sales cycle. In addition, purchases of our solutions are frequently subject to budget constraints, multiple approvals, and unplanned administrative, processing and other delays. We spend substantial time, effort and money in our sales efforts without any assurance that our efforts will produce any sales. In addition, cancellation of any implementation after it has begun might result in lost time, effort, and expenses invested in the cancelled implementation process and lost opportunity for implementing paying customers in that same period of time. These factors may contribute to significant fluctuations in our revenue and operating results.\nOur revenue and operating results have fluctuated, and are likely to continue to fluctuate, which may make our quarterly results difficult to predict, cause us to miss analyst expectations and cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nOur revenue and operating results may be difficult to predict, even in the near term, and are likely to fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. Comparisons of our revenue and operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. You should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance. Each of the following factors, among others, could cause our revenue and operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter:\n\u2022\nthe financial health of our healthcare customers and budgetary constraints on their ability to purchase authentication and access management solutions;\n\u2022\nchanges in the regulatory environment affecting our healthcare customers, including impediments to their ability to obtain third-party reimbursement for their services;\n\u2022\nour ability to develop and introduce new solutions and products and enhance existing solutions that achieve market acceptance;\n\u2022\nthe procurement and deployment cycles of our healthcare customers and the length of our sales cycles;\n\u2022\nour ability to forecast demand and manage lead times for the manufacture of hardware used in our solutions;\n\u2022\nthe mix of our product and service revenue and pricing, including discounts by us or our competitors; and\n\u2022\nthe timing of when orders are fulfilled and revenue is recognized.\nThe resulting variability and unpredictability could result in our failure to meet our operating plan or the expectations of investors or analysts for any period. If we fail to meet such expectations for these or other reasons, the market price of our common stock may decline.\nIf we are unable to maintain successful relationships with our channel partners and technology alliance partners, our ability to market, sell and distribute our solutions will be limited and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIn addition to our direct sales force, we rely on our sales partners, consisting of our channel partners and technology alliance partners, to sell our solutions. We derive a substantial portion of our revenue from sales of our products and services through our sales partners, and we expect that sales through sales partners will continue to be a significant percentage of our revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, 8%, 10% and 10%, respectively, of our total revenues were derived from our largest sales partner.\nOur agreements with our sales partners are generally non-exclusive, meaning our sales partners may offer their customers products and services from several different companies, including products and services that compete with ours. We depend on channel partners to supplement our direct sales organization within the United States and internationally. If our channel partners do not effectively market and sell our products and services, choose to use greater efforts to market and sell their own products and services or those of our competitors, or fail to meet the needs of our customers, our ability to grow our business and sell our products and services may be adversely affected. Our channel partners may cease marketing our products and services with limited or no notice and with little or no penalty, and they have no obligation to renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. The loss of a substantial number of our channel partners, our possible inability to replace them, or the failure to recruit additional channel partners could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. New channel partners require extensive training and may take several months or more to achieve productivity for us. Our channel partner structure could also subject us to lawsuits or reputational harm if, for example, a channel partner misrepresents the functionality of our platform to customers or violates applicable laws or our corporate policies applicable to the partner. We work with our technology alliance partners to design go-to-market strategies that combine our solutions with products or services provided by our technology alliance\npartners. The loss of a technology alliance partner may mean that certain of our solutions that were designed to interoperate with the products or services provided by the technology alliance partner may no longer function as intended and require substantial re-engineering or the development of new solutions and products.\nOur ability to generate revenue in the future will depend in part on our success in maintaining effective working relationships with our sales partners, in expanding our indirect sales channel, in training our channel partners to independently sell and deploy our solutions and in continuing to integrate our solutions with the products and services offered by our technology alliance partners. If we are unable to maintain our relationships with these sales partners, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe depend on sole source suppliers and a contract manufacturer for hardware components of our Imprivata OneSign solution. If we are unable to source our components from them or effectively forecast our customer demand to properly manage our inventory, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nWe depend on sole source suppliers for hardware components of our Imprivata OneSign solution. We rely upon Cross Match Technologies, Inc. (formerly DigitalPersona, Inc.) as the only provider of our fingerprint readers. Although we currently purchase all of our proximity cards from RF IDeas, Inc., we believe alternative sources are available. In addition, we depend on a contract manufacturer to produce certain other hardware components for our solutions. Our agreements with RF IDeas, Inc. and our contract manufacturer renew automatically on an annual basis. These agreements do not contain supply commitments. We purchase our fingerprint readers from Avnet on a purchase order basis, and do not have the benefit of a long-term supply agreement or supply commitments. As a result, we cannot assure you that our suppliers and contract manufacturer will be able to meet our requirements, which could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nAny of these suppliers or contract manufacturer could cease production of our components, experience capacity constraints, material shortages, work stoppages, financial difficulties, cost increases or other reductions or disruptions in output, cease operations or be acquired by, or enter into exclusive arrangements with, a competitor. These suppliers and contract manufacturer typically rely on purchase orders rather than long-term contracts with their suppliers. As a result, even if available, an affected supplier or contract manufacturer may not be able to secure sufficient materials at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build our components in a timely manner, forcing us to seek components from alternative sources, which may not have the required specifications, or be available in time to meet demand or on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.\nWe also place orders with our suppliers and contract manufacturer for our inventory based on forecasts of customer demand. Our forecasts are based on multiple assumptions, each of which may introduce errors into our estimates affecting our ability to meet our customers\u2019 demands for our solutions or manage our inventory effectively. We may also be forced to redesign our solutions if a component becomes unavailable in order to incorporate a component from an alternative source, which may increase the cost of providing our solutions. Any of these circumstances could cause interruptions or delays in the delivery of our solutions to our customers, and could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nOur use of third-party off-shore development providers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSince 2006, we have relied upon a third-party development provider in Lviv, Ukraine to assist with software development, quality assurance, testing and automation to reduce costs and to meet our customers\u2019 needs in a timely manner. These services are performed pursuant to statements of work under a master services agreement. The development provider may terminate its agreement with us without cause with 60 days\u2019 notice, unless a statement of work is in progress. While they have been dependable in the past, we have less control over the development provider\u2019s performance than if it was comprised of our employees or if the development provider was located in the United States. As a result, we are subject to the risk that the development provider will not perform as anticipated. Furthermore, in recent periods, Ukraine has experienced civil unrest and political and economic uncertainties. The evolving economic, political and social developments in the Ukraine may materially\nand adversely affect the operations of the development provider in ways beyond their control and may constrain our ability to assert or defend our contractual or other legal rights relating to our relationship with the development provider and its handling of our intellectual property. Since June of 2014, we have also relied upon a third-party developer in Buenos Aires, Argentina to assist with software development, quality assurance, testing and automation to reduce costs and to meet our customers\u2019 needs in a timely manner. These services are performed pursuant to statements of work under a master services agreement. The development provider may terminate its agreement with us without cause with 30 days\u2019 notice, unless a statement of work is in progress. We have less control over the development provider\u2019s performance than if it was comprised of our employees or if the development provider was located in the United States. If we are unable to rely upon either of these development provider for the reasons stated above or for other reasons, we may be required to shift development projects to our employees or to another independent contractor. As a result, we may face increased costs and delays in our ability to introduce new solutions or products or provide services. These risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are not able to manage our growth effectively, or if our business does not grow as we expect, our operating results will be adversely affected.\nWe have experienced significant revenue growth in recent periods. For example, our revenue increased from $22.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, to $97.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. During this period, we significantly expanded our operations and increased the number of our employees from 105 at December 31, 2008 to 378 at December 31, 2014. Our rapid growth has placed, and will continue to place, a significant strain on our management systems, infrastructure and other resources. We plan to hire additional direct sales and marketing personnel domestically and internationally, increase our investment in research and development and acquire complementary businesses, technologies or assets. Our future operating results depend to a large extent on our ability to successfully implement these plans and manage our anticipated expansion. To do so successfully we must, among other things:\n\u2022\nmanage our expenses in line with our operating plans and current business environment;\n\u2022\nmaintain and enhance our operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures;\n\u2022\ndevelop and deliver new solutions and enhancements to existing solutions efficiently and reliably;\n\u2022\nmanage operations in multiple locations and time zones; and\n\u2022\nintegrate acquired businesses, technologies or assets.\nWe expect to incur costs associated with the investments made to support our growth before the anticipated benefits or the returns are realized, if at all. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities or develop new solutions or enhancements to existing solutions. We may also fail to satisfy customer requirements, maintain quality, execute our business plan or respond to competitive pressures, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nChanges in renewal rates in our software maintenance contracts may not be immediately reflected in our operating results.\nWe generally recognize revenue from our software maintenance contracts ratably over the contract term. A portion of the maintenance revenue we report in each quarter is derived from the recognition of deferred revenue relating to software maintenance contracts entered into during previous quarters. In each of the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2014, we retained greater than 90% of the aggregate dollar amount of our software maintenance contracts up for renewal. Consequently, a decline in renewed software maintenance by our customers in any one quarter may not be immediately reflected in our revenue for that quarter. Such a decline, however, will adversely affect our revenue in future quarters. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in our rate of renewals may not be fully reflected in our operating results until future periods.\nWe primarily operate in the rapidly evolving and highly competitive healthcare market, and if we fail to effectively respond to competitive pressures, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.\nThe market for authentication and access management solutions within the healthcare market is highly fragmented, consisting of a significant number of vendors that is rapidly changing. Competition in our market is primarily based on:\n\u2022\nbrand awareness and reputation;\n\u2022\nbreadth of our solutions set and ease of implementation, use and management;\n\u2022\nbreadth of product distribution;\n\u2022\nstrategic relationships and ability to integrate with software and device vendors; and\n\u2022\nproduct innovation and ability to meet customer needs.\nWe believe our primary competitor in the healthcare industry is Caradigm USA LLC, a joint venture of General Electric Company and Microsoft Corporation. We expect competition to intensify in the future with existing competitors and market entrants. Our competitors in the healthcare market for authentication and access management solutions include large, multinational companies with significantly more resources to dedicate to product development and sales and marketing. These companies may have existing relationships within healthcare organizations, which may enhance their ability to gain a foothold in our market. Customers may prefer to purchase a more highly integrated or bundled solution from a single provider or an existing supplier rather than a separate supplier, regardless of performance or features. Increased competition may result in additional pricing pressure, reduced profit margins, higher sales and marketing expenses, lower revenue and the loss of market share, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe market for secure communications in the healthcare market in which our Cortext solution competes is also highly fragmented, consisting of an increasing number of vendors that is rapidly changing. We believe our primary competitor in secure communications in the healthcare market is TigerText, and we expect competition to intensify in the future with existing competitors and market entrants. As in the healthcare market for authentication and access management solutions, competitors in the healthcare market for secure communications include large, multinational companies with significantly more resources to dedicate to product development and sales and marketing.\nIndustry consolidation or new market entrants may result in increased competitive pressure, which could result in the loss of customers or a reduction in revenue.\nSome of our competitors have made or may make acquisitions or may enter into partnerships or other strategic relationships to offer more comprehensive services than they individually had offered or achieve greater economies of scale. We expect these trends to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or maintain their market positions. For example, potential entrants not currently considered to be our competitors, such as providers of electronic health record systems, may enter our market by acquiring or developing their own access or authentication management solutions. In addition, providers of authentication and access management solutions, such as CA, Inc., International Business Machines Corporation, Oracle Corporation and Novell, Inc., may enter the healthcare market. Such potential entrants, if they enter the healthcare market for authentication and access management solutions, may have competitive advantages over us, such as greater name recognition, longer operating histories, more varied services and larger marketing budgets, as well as greater financial, technical and other resources. The companies resulting from combinations or that expand or vertically integrate their business to include the authentication and access management market that we address may create more compelling service offerings and may offer greater pricing flexibility than we can or may engage in business practices that make it more difficult for us to compete effectively, including on the basis of price, sales and marketing programs, technology or service functionality. These pressures could result in a substantial loss of our customers, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur success depends upon our ability to attract, integrate and retain key personnel, and our failure to do so could adversely affect our ability to grow our business.\nOur success depends, in part, on the services of our senior management and other key personnel, and our ability to continue to attract, integrate and retain highly skilled personnel, particularly in engineering, sales and marketing. Competition for highly skilled personnel is intense. If we fail to attract, integrate and retain key personnel, our ability to grow our business could be adversely affected.\nThe members of our senior management and other key personnel are at-will employees, and may terminate their employment at any time without notice. If they terminate their employment, we may not be able to find qualified individuals to replace them on a timely basis or at all and our senior management may need to divert their attention from other aspects of our business. Former employees may also become employees of a competitor. We may also have to pay additional compensation to attract and retain key personnel. We also anticipate hiring additional engineering, marketing and sales, and services personnel to grow our business. Often, significant amounts of time and resources are required to recruit and train these personnel. We may incur significant costs to attract, integrate and retain them, and we may lose them to a competitor or another company before we realize the benefit of our investments in them.\nIf we do not achieve the anticipated strategic or financial benefits from our acquisitions, or if we cannot successfully integrate them, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nWe have acquired, and in the future may acquire, complementary businesses, technologies or assets that we believe to be strategic. We may not achieve the anticipated strategic or financial benefits, or be successful in integrating any acquired businesses, technologies or assets. If we cannot effectively integrate newly-acquired technologies and solutions and successfully market and sell these new product offerings, we may not achieve market acceptance for, or significant revenue from, these new product offerings.\nIntegrating newly-acquired businesses, technologies and assets could strain our resources, could be expensive and time consuming, and might not be successful. If we acquire or invest in additional businesses, technologies or assets, we will be further exposed, to a number of risks, including that we may:\n\u2022\nexperience technical issues as we integrate acquired businesses, technologies or assets into our existing solutions;\n\u2022\nencounter difficulties leveraging our existing sales and marketing organizations, and sales channels, to increase our revenue from acquired businesses, technologies or assets;\n\u2022\nfind that the acquisition does not further our business strategy, that we overpaid for the acquisition or that the economic conditions underlying our acquisition decision have changed;\n\u2022\nhave difficulty retaining the key personnel of acquired businesses;\n\u2022\nsuffer disruption to our ongoing business and diversion of our management\u2019s attention as a result of the negotiation of any acquisition as well as related transition or integration issues and the challenges of managing geographically or culturally diverse enterprises; and\n\u2022\nexperience unforeseen and significant problems or liabilities associated with quality, technology and legal contingencies relating to the acquisition, such as intellectual property or employment matters.\nIn addition, from time to time we may enter into negotiations for acquisitions that are not ultimately consummated. These negotiations could result in significant diversion of management time, as well as substantial out-of-pocket costs. If we were to proceed with one or more significant acquisitions in which the consideration included cash, we could be required to use a substantial portion of our available cash. To the extent we issue shares of capital stock or other rights to purchase capital stock, including options and warrants, the ownership of existing stockholders would be diluted. In addition, acquisitions may result in the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, write-offs or other unanticipated costs, events or circumstances, any of which adversely affect our business and operating results.\nThe software and hardware contained in the Imprivata OneSign solution is complex and may contain undetected errors that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur Imprivata OneSign solution incorporates complex technology, is used in a variety of healthcare settings and must interoperate with many different types of complex devices and information technology systems. While we test our solutions for defects and errors prior to release, we or our customers may not discover a defect or error until after we have deployed our solutions and our customers have commenced general use of the solution. If we cannot successfully integrate our authentication and access management solutions with health information systems as needed or if any hardware or software of these health information systems contains any defect or error, then our solutions may not perform as designed, or may exhibit a defect or error.\nAny defects or errors in, or which are attributed to, our solutions, could result in:\n\u2022\ndelayed market acceptance of our affected solutions;\n\u2022\nloss of customers or inability to attract new customers;\n\u2022\ndiversion of engineering or other resources for remedying the defect or error;\n\u2022\ndamage to our brand and reputation;\n\u2022\nincreased service and warranty costs;\n\u2022\nlegal actions by our customers or third parties, including product liability claims; and\n\u2022\npenalties imposed by regulatory authorities.\nOur solutions are utilized by clinicians in the course of providing patient care. It is possible that our healthcare customers may allege we are responsible for harm to patients or clinicians due to defects in, the malfunction of, the characteristics of, or the use of, our solutions. Although our customer agreements contain disclaimers of liability that are intended to reduce or eliminate our potential liability, we could be required to spend significant amounts of management time and resources to defend ourselves against product liability, tort, warranty or other claims. If any such claims were to prevail, we could be forced to pay damages or stop distributing our solutions. Even if potential claims do not result in liability to us, investigating and defending against these claims could be expensive and time consuming and could divert management\u2019s attention away from our business. We maintain general liability insurance coverage, including coverage for errors and omissions; however, this coverage may not be sufficient to cover large claims against us or otherwise continue to be available on acceptable terms. Further, the insurer could attempt to disclaim coverage as to any particular claim. Such circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur international operations subject us, and may increasingly subject us in the future, to operational, financial, economic and political risks abroad, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAlthough we currently derive a relatively small portion of our revenue from customers outside of the United States, a key element of our growth strategy is to expand internationally. Our international expansion efforts might not be successful in creating demand for our products and services or in effectively selling our solutions in the international markets we enter. In addition, we will face risks in doing business internationally that could adversely affect our business, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulties integrating our solutions with information technology systems and processes with which we do not have experience;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic instability in, or foreign conflicts that involve or affect, the countries where we operate and sell our solution;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing personnel and channel partners;\n\u2022\nthe need to comply with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations, including privacy and security regulations, requirements for export controls for encryption technology, employment laws, changes in tax laws and tax audits by government agencies;\n\u2022\ncompetitors who are more familiar with local markets;\n\u2022\nchallenges associated with delivering services, training and documentation in foreign languages;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in collecting accounts receivable and longer accounts receivable payment cycles; and\n\u2022\nlimited or unfavorable intellectual property protection in some countries.\nIn addition, as we continue to expand our international operations, we have become more exposed to the effects of fluctuations in currency exchange rates. We incur expenses for employee compensation and other operating expenses at our international locations and accept payment from customers in the local currency. Since we conduct business in currencies other than the U.S. dollar but report our operating results in U.S. dollars, we have exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. We do not currently hedge against the risks associated with currency fluctuations but may do so in the future.\nAny of these factors could harm our existing international business and operations, and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks posed by sales to foreign government-operated healthcare organizations could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and operating results.\nWe expect to continue to derive a substantial portion of our international revenues from foreign government-operated healthcare organizations. Sales to governmental entities present risks in addition to those involved in sales to commercial customers, including potential disruption due to changes in appropriation and spending patterns, delays in budget approvals and exposure to penalties in the event of violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. General political and economic conditions, which we cannot accurately predict, directly and indirectly may affect the quantity and allocation of expenditures by governmental entities. In addition, obtaining government contracts may involve long purchase and payment cycles, competitive bidding, qualification requirements, delays or changes in funding, budgetary constraints, political agendas, extensive specification development and price negotiations and milestone requirements. In general, each governmental entity also maintains its own rules and regulations with which we must comply and which can vary significantly among departments. These factors may result in cutbacks or re-allocations in the budget or losses of government sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and operating results.\nIf we fail to offer services that are satisfactory to our customers, our ability to sell our solutions will be adversely affected.\nOur ability to sell our Imprivata OneSign solution is dependent upon our ability to provide high-quality services and support. Our services team assists our customers with their clinical workflow design, authentication and access management solution configuration, training and project management during the pre-deployment and deployment stages. Once our solutions are deployed within a customer\u2019s facility, the customer typically depends on our services team to help resolve technical issues, assist in optimizing the use of our solutions and facilitate adoption of new functionality. A substantial proportion of our Imprivata OneSign customers in the United States rely on our Imprivata OneSign solution as a means to access their electronic health record, or EHR, systems that they implement to meet regulatory standards for adoption, or \u201cmeaningful use,\u201d of EHR technologies. If our solutions do not adequately facilitate our customers\u2019 attainment of meaningful use requirements as defined by the relevant regulatory authorities and interpreted by our customers, or if deployment of our solutions is unsatisfactory, we may incur significant costs to attain and sustain customer satisfaction. As we hire new services personnel, we may inadvertently hire underperforming people who will have to be replaced, or fail to effectively train such employees. If we do not effectively assist our customers in deploying our solutions, succeed in helping our customers resolve technical and other post-deployment\nissues, or provide effective ongoing services, our ability to expand the use of our solutions with existing customers and to sell our solutions to new customers will be harmed. In addition, the failure of channel partners to provide high-quality services in markets outside of the United States could adversely affect sales of our solutions internationally.\nWe face potential liability related to the privacy and security of protected health information accessed or collected through our solutions.\nOur Imprivata OneSign solution customers in the ordinary course of their business handle, access or store protected health information, or PHI. In the United States, the manner in which these customers manage PHI is subject to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH Act, health data privacy, security and breach notification regulations issued pursuant to these statutes, and state privacy, security and breach notification laws and regulations applicable to such health information. These customers rely on our Imprivata OneSign solution as a tool to facilitate their compliance with applicable health data privacy and security standards. Specifically, HIPAA-covered health care providers are required to implement technical data security safeguards, certain of which are supported by Imprivata OneSign. The failure of our Imprivata OneSign solution to perform an essential function for which it was designed could result in a breach of our obligations under our customer contracts, which could result in monetary damages, adverse publicity, and have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe may also directly handle, access or store PHI in connection with our commercial solutions, such as our Imprivata Cortext solution, which is a secure, cloud-based communication platform that provides healthcare organizations and healthcare providers with secure SMS texting and messaging capabilities. Although we are transmitting and storing PHI in encrypted format for such customers, and do not, in the ordinary course of our business, require access to such PHI, we are deemed to be a \u201cbusiness associate\u201d of such customers and as such are directly subject to certain HIPAA and HITECH Act requirements as well as contractual obligations that may be imposed by our customers pursuant to their HIPAA and HITECH Act requirements. These statutes, regulations and contractual obligations impose numerous requirements regarding the use and disclosure of PHI. Our failure to effectively implement the required or addressable health data privacy and security safeguards and breach notification procedures, our failure to accurately anticipate the application or interpretation of these statutes, regulations and contractual obligations as we develop our solutions or an allegation that defects in our products have resulted in noncompliance by our customers could result in a breach of our contractual obligations to our customers, create material civil and/or criminal liability for us, which could result in adverse publicity and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition to complying with applicable U.S. law, the use and disclosure of PHI is subject to regulation in other jurisdictions in which we do business or expect to do business in the future. Those jurisdictions may attempt to apply such laws extraterritorially or through treaties or other arrangements with U.S. governmental entities. We might unintentionally violate such laws, such laws may be modified and new laws may be enacted in the future which may increase the chance that we violate them. Any such developments, or developments stemming from enactment or modification of other laws, or the failure by us to comply with their requirements or to accurately anticipate the application or interpretation of these laws, could discourage us from offering certain of our solutions, such as Imprivata Cortext, to customers outside of the United States, and could create material liability to us, result in adverse publicity and adversely affect our business. A finding that we have failed to comply with applicable laws and regulations regarding the collection, use and disclosure of PHI could create liability for us, result in adverse publicity and materially adversely affect our business.\nIn addition, the costs of compliance with, and the other burdens imposed by, these and other laws or regulatory actions may prevent us from selling our solutions or increase the costs associated with selling our solutions, and may affect our ability to invest in or jointly develop solutions in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. Further, we cannot assure you that our privacy and security policies and practices will be found sufficient to protect us from liability or adverse publicity relating to the privacy and security of PHI.\nFluctuating economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur revenue depends significantly on general economic conditions and the demand for authentication and access management solutions in the healthcare market. Our healthcare customers may experience declining revenues from the decreased utilization of healthcare services and diminishing margins due to impediments in obtaining third-party reimbursement and patient payments. These factors may result in constrained spending on authentication and access management solutions. General economic weakness may also lead to longer collection cycles for payments due from our customers, an increase in customer bad debt, restructuring initiatives and associated expenses, and impairment of investments. Uncertainty about future economic conditions also makes it difficult to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments. Such factors could make it difficult to accurately forecast our sales and operating results and could adversely affect our ability to provide accurate forecasts to our suppliers and contract manufacturer and manage our supplier and contract manufacturer relationships and other expenses. Economic weakness faced by us or our customers, failure of our customers and markets to recover from such weakness, customer financial difficulties, and reductions in spending on authentication and access management technologies could have a material adverse effect on demand for our solutions and consequently on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe market size estimates we have provided publicly may prove to be inaccurate and may not be indicative of our future growth.\nThe healthcare industry is in the early stages of market acceptance of authentication and access management solutions. Because of rapid and significant technological changes, it is difficult to predict the size of the market and the rate at which the market for our products and services will grow or be accepted. While the estimates of the total available market we have provided publicly are made in good faith and are based on assumptions and estimates we believe to be reasonable, these estimates may not prove to be accurate. This is particularly the case with respect to estimating the size of the international component of the market.\nOur Imprivata Cortext solution uses a third-party data service provider for web hosting services. Any operational delay or failure of our Cortext solution could expose us to litigation, harm our relationships with customers and have a material adverse effect on our brand and our business.\nOur Imprivata Cortext solution utilizes a cloud-based third-party data service provider for web hosting services. We exercise limited control over this third-party data service provider, which increases our vulnerability with respect to the technology and information services it provides. In addition, if we are unable to renew the agreement with the third-party data service provider on commercially reasonable terms, we may be required to transfer our services to new data service providers and we may incur significant costs and possible service interruption in connection with doing so. Our Cortext solution provides communication and information to assist healthcare organizations. Any operational delay or failure of our Cortext solution might result in the disruption of patient care and could harm our relationships with customers, expose us to litigation or have a material adverse effect on our brand and our business.\nSales of our Imprivata Confirm ID solution are largely driven by legislation requiring that prescriptions be sent electronically. Any delay in the enactment of such laws could cause sales of Imprivata Confirm ID to be adversely affected.\nOur Imprivata Confirm ID solution simplifies the adoption of regulatory requirements for electronic prescribing of controlled substances (EPCS), thereby helping care providers address the workflow inefficiencies and potential for fraud caused by paper-based prescriptions, We anticipate that sales of Imprivata Confirm ID will be driven primarily by the adoption of state and federal mandates requiring that prescriptions be sent electronically. For example, New York\u2019s I-STOP (Internet System for Tracking Over-Prescribing) law mandates that all patient medications be prescribed electronically. The current deadline for prescribers to comply with I-STOP is\nMarch 27, 2015; however pending legislation may extend this deadline. This delay, and any future delays, may adversely affect sales of Imprivata Confirm ID. In addition, if other states fail to enact legislation requiring that prescriptions be sent electronically, sales of Imprivata Confirm ID may also be adversely affected.\nSales of subscription-based products sold together with perpetual software products may result in revenue fluctuations.\nThe timing of revenue recognition for existing products licensed on a perpetual basis will differ in the event customers elect to purchase both perpetual and subscription-based products together. Revenue for our perpetual software products is recognized upon shipment; however, if sold in a multiple element arrangement with subscription-based products, the revenue associated with the perpetual license will likely be recognized over the period of the subscription to the extent we are unable to determine the vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of undelivered software products. As a result, our growth rate and operating results could be adversely affected and could impact our stock price. The Company is not able to accurately estimate the likelihood or magnitude of these transactions.\nIf we are required to collect sales and use or similar foreign taxes in additional jurisdictions, we might be subject to liability for past sales and our future sales may decrease.\nWe might lose sales or incur significant expenses if states or foreign jurisdictions successfully impose broader guidelines on state sales and use or similar foreign taxes. A successful assertion by one or more states or foreign jurisdictions requiring us to collect sales or other taxes on the licensing of our software or sale of our services could result in substantial tax liabilities for past transactions and otherwise harm our business. Each state or foreign jurisdiction has different rules and regulations governing sales and use or similar foreign taxes, and these rules and regulations are subject to varying complex interpretations that change over time. We review these rules and regulations periodically and, when we believe we are subject to sales and use or similar foreign taxes in a particular state or foreign jurisdiction, engage tax authorities in order to determine how to comply with their rules and regulations. We cannot assure you that we will not be subject to sales and use or similar taxes or related penalties for past sales in states or foreign jurisdictions where we currently believe no such taxes are required.\nVendors of products and services, like us, are typically held responsible by taxing authorities for the collection and payment of any applicable sales and similar taxes. If one or more taxing authorities determines that taxes should have, but have not, been paid with respect to our services, we might be liable for past taxes in addition to taxes going forward. Liability for past taxes might also include substantial interest and penalty charges. Our customer contracts typically provide that our customers must pay all applicable sales and similar taxes. Nevertheless, our customers might be reluctant to pay back taxes and might refuse responsibility for interest or penalties associated with those taxes. If we are required to collect and pay back taxes and the associated interest and penalties, and if our clients fail or refuse to reimburse us for all or a portion of these amounts, we will incur unplanned expenses that may be substantial. Moreover, imposition of such taxes on us going forward will effectively increase the cost of our products and services to our customers and might adversely affect our ability to retain existing customers or to gain new customers in the areas in which such taxes are imposed.\nOur ability to use our net operating losses to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\nIn general, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change net operating losses, or NOLs, to offset future taxable income. If we undergo an ownership change in connection with or after this offering or any future offering, our ability to utilize NOLs could be further limited by Section 382 of the Code. Future changes in our stock ownership, some of which are outside of our control, could result in an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code. Furthermore, our ability to utilize NOLs of companies that we may acquire in the future may be subject to limitations. There is also a risk that due to regulatory changes, such as suspensions on the use of NOLs, or other unforeseen reasons, our existing NOLs could expire or otherwise be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities. For these reasons, we may not be able to utilize a material portion of the NOLs reflected on our balance sheet, even if we attain profitability.\nOur business is subject to the risks of earthquakes, fire, floods and other natural catastrophic events, and to interruption by man-made problems such as power disruptions or terrorism.\nA significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, fire or a flood, occurring at our headquarters, our other facilities or where our contract manufacturer or its suppliers are located, could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, acts of terrorism could cause disruptions in our business, the businesses of our customers and suppliers, or the economy as a whole. We also rely on information technology systems to communicate among our workforce located worldwide, and in particular, our senior management, general and administrative, and research and development activities that are coordinated with our corporate headquarters in the Boston, Massachusetts area and Santa Cruz, California and San Francisco, California offices. Any disruption to our internal communications, whether caused by a natural disaster or by man-made problems, such as power disruptions, in the Boston, Massachusetts area and Santa Cruz, California and San Francisco, California offices could delay our research and development efforts, cause delays or cancellations of customer orders or delay deployment of our solutions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur loan agreement contains operating and financial covenants that may restrict our business and financing activities.\nWe are party to a loan and security agreement relating to a revolving line of credit facility with Silicon Valley Bank. Borrowings under this loan and security agreement are secured by substantially all of our assets. Our loan and security agreement restricts our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\nredeem subordinated indebtedness;\n\u2022\ncreate liens on our assets;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nmake investments;\n\u2022\nsell assets;\n\u2022\nmake material changes in our business or management;\n\u2022\npay dividends, other than dividends paid solely in shares of our common stock, or make distributions on and, in certain cases, repurchase our stock; or\n\u2022\nconsolidate or merge with other entities.\nIn addition, our revolving line of credit requires us to maintain specified adjusted quick ratio tests. The operating and financial restrictions and covenants in the loan and security agreement governing our revolving line of credit, as well as any future financing agreements that we may enter into, may restrict our ability to finance our operations, engage in business activities or expand or fully pursue our business strategies. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, and we may not be able to meet those covenants. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the loan and security agreement, which could cause all of the outstanding indebtedness under the facility to become immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit.\nIf we are unable to generate sufficient cash available to repay our debt obligations when they become due and payable, either when they mature or in the event of a default, we may not be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms, if at all, which may negatively impact our ability to continue as a going concern.\nRisks related to our intellectual property\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, our competitive position could be harmed or we could be required to incur significant expenses to enforce our rights.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to protect our proprietary technology. We seek to protect our proprietary technology through patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark laws in the United States and similar laws in other countries. We also seek to protect our proprietary technology through licensing agreements, nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions. These protections may not be available in all cases or may be inadequate to prevent our competitors from copying, reverse engineering or otherwise obtaining and using our technology, proprietary rights or solutions in an unauthorized manner. The laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the United States, and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate. In addition, third parties may seek to challenge, invalidate or circumvent our patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets, or applications for any of the foregoing. Our competitors may independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent, or superior, to our technology or design around our proprietary rights. In each case, our ability to compete could be significantly impaired.\nTo prevent unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights, it may be necessary to prosecute actions for infringement or misappropriation of our proprietary rights. Any such action could result in significant costs and diversion of our resources and management\u2019s attention, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in such action. Furthermore, many of our current and potential competitors have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to enforce their intellectual property rights than we do. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our intellectual property. While we plan to continue to seek to protect our intellectual property with, among other things, patent protection, there can be no assurance that:\n\u2022\ncurrent or future U.S. or foreign patent applications will be approved;\n\u2022\nour issued patents will adequately protect our intellectual property and not be held invalid or unenforceable if challenged by third parties;\n\u2022\nwe will succeed in protecting our technology adequately in all key jurisdictions in which we or our competitors operate; and\n\u2022\nothers will not design around any patents that may be issued to us.\nOur failure to obtain patents sufficiently broad to cover our technology and possible workarounds, or the invalidation of our patents, or our inability adequately to protect our intellectual property, may weaken our competitive position and harm our business and operating results. We might be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights. We may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights. Any litigation, whether or not it is resolved in our favor, could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel, which may harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nAgreements we have with our employees, consultants and independent contractors may not afford adequate protection for our trade secrets, confidential information and other proprietary information.\nIn addition to patent protection, we also rely on copyright and trademark protection, trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and licensing opportunities. In an effort to maintain the confidentiality and ownership of our trade secrets and proprietary information, we require our employees, consultants and independent contractors to execute confidentiality and proprietary information agreements. However, these agreements may not provide us with adequate protection against improper use or disclosure of confidential information and available remedies in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure may not be adequate. The failure by employees, consultants or independent contractors to maintain the secrecy of our confidential information may compromise or prevent our ability to maintain trade secrets or obtain needed or meaningful\npatent protection. In some situations, our confidentiality and proprietary information agreements may conflict with, or be subject to, the rights of third parties with whom our employees, consultants or independent contractors have prior employment or consulting relationships. Although we require our employees, consultants and independent contractors to maintain the confidentiality of all proprietary information of their previous employers, these individuals, or we, may be subject to allegations of trade secret misappropriation or other similar claims as a result of their prior affiliations. Finally, others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or gain access to our trade secrets. Our failure or inability to protect our proprietary information and techniques may inhibit or limit our ability to compete effectively, or exclude certain competitors from the market.\nWe may not be able to obtain or maintain necessary licenses of third-party technology on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, which could delay product sales and development and have a material adverse effect on product quality and our ability to compete.\nWe have incorporated third-party licensed technology into certain of our solutions. We anticipate that we are also likely to need to license additional technology from third parties in connection with the development of new solutions or enhancements in the future. Third-party licenses may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. The inability to retain any third-party licenses required in our current solutions or to obtain any new third-party licenses to develop new solutions and products could require us to obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at greater cost, and delay or prevent us from introducing these solutions or products, any of which could have a material adverse effect on product quality and our ability to compete.\nClaims of intellectual property infringement could harm our business.\nVigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights has resulted in protracted and expensive litigation for many companies in our industry. Although claims of this kind have not materially affected our business to date, there can be no assurance such claims will not arise in the future. Any claims or proceedings against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, require significant amounts of management time, result in the diversion of significant operational resources, or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements, any of which could harm our business and operating results.\nIntellectual property lawsuits are subject to inherent uncertainties due to the complexity of the technical issues involved, and we cannot be certain that we will be successful in defending ourselves against intellectual property claims. In addition, we may not be able to effectively utilize our intellectual property portfolio to assert defenses or counterclaims in response to patent infringement claims or litigation brought against us by third parties. Further, litigation may involve patent holding companies or other adverse patent owners who have no relevant products and against whom our potential patents may provide little or no deterrence.\nMany potential litigants have the capability to dedicate substantially greater resources to enforce their intellectual property rights and to defend claims that may be brought against them. Furthermore, a successful claimant could secure a judgment that requires us to pay substantial damages or prevents us from distributing certain solutions or performing certain services. We might also be required to seek a license and pay royalties for the use of such intellectual property, which may not be available on commercially acceptable terms or at all. Alternatively, we may be required to develop non-infringing technology, which could require significant effort and expense and may ultimately not be successful.\nOur use of open source and non-commercial software components could impose risks and limitations on our ability to commercialize our solutions.\nOur solutions contain software modules licensed under open source and other types of non-commercial licenses. We also may incorporate open source and other licensed software into our solutions in the future. Use and distribution of such software may entail greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as licenses of\nthese types generally do not provide warranties or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the code. Some of these licenses require the release of our proprietary source code to the public if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in certain manners. This could allow competitors to create similar products with lower development effort and time and ultimately result in a loss of sales for us.\nThe terms of many open source and other non-commercial licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. courts, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our solutions. In such event, in order to continue offering our solutions, we could be required to seek licenses from alternative licensors, which may not be available on a commercially reasonable basis or at all, to re-engineer our solutions or to discontinue the sale of our solutions in the event we cannot obtain a license or re-engineer our solutions on a timely basis, any of which could harm our business and operating results. In addition, if an owner of licensed software were to allege that we had not complied with the conditions of the corresponding license agreement, we could incur significant legal costs defending ourselves against such allegations. In the event such claims were successful, we could be subject to significant damages, be required to disclose our source code, or be enjoined from the distribution of our solutions.\nRisks related to our common stock\nWe do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not currently intend to do so for the foreseeable future. We currently intend to invest our future earnings, if any, to fund our growth. Therefore, you are not likely to receive any dividends on your common stock for the foreseeable future, and the success of an investment in shares of our common stock will depend upon future appreciation in its value, if any. There is no guarantee that shares of our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which our stockholders purchased their shares.\nMarket volatility may affect our common stock price and the value of your investment:\nThe market price of shares of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations as a result of many risks listed in this section, and others beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nour operating performance and the operating performance of similar companies;\n\u2022\nthe overall performance of the equity markets;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of new products, commercial relationships or acquisitions;\n\u2022\nthreatened or actual litigation;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws or regulations relating to the healthcare industry;\n\u2022\nany major change in our board of directors or management;\n\u2022\npublication of research reports or news stories about us, our competitors, or our industry, or positive or negative recommendations or withdrawal of research coverage by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nlarge volumes of sales of our shares of common stock by existing stockholders; and\n\u2022\ngeneral political and economic conditions.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and the market for healthcare information technology companies in particular, has at times experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies.\nSecurities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the market price of a company\u2019s securities. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs, divert our management\u2019s attention and resources, and harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nFuture sales of shares of our common stock by existing stockholders could depress the market price of our common stock.\nThere are 23,782,669 shares of our common stock outstanding, based on the number of shares outstanding as of December 31, 2014. An aggregate of 2,347,615 shares of our common stock are reserved for future issuance under our stock option plans, and 448,000 shares of our common stock are reserved for future issuance under our ESPP. These shares can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance. If a large number of these shares are sold in the public market, the sales could reduce the trading price of our common stock.\nThe concentration of our capital stock ownership with insiders will likely limit your ability to influence corporate matters.\nOur executive officers, directors, current 5% or greater stockholders and entities affiliated with any of them, together beneficially own 64.5% of our common stock outstanding, based on the number of shares outstanding as of December 31, 2014. These stockholders, if they act together, will have significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, and may take actions that may not be in the best interests of our other stockholders. This concentration of ownership could also limit stockholders\u2019 ability to influence corporate matters. Accordingly, corporate actions might be taken even if other stockholders, including those who purchase shares in this offering, oppose them, or may not be taken even if other stockholders view them as in the best interests of our stockholders. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company, may make the approval of certain transactions difficult or impossible without the support of these stockholders and might adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of: the end of the fiscal year in which the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of June 30 of that fiscal year, the end of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of $1 billion or more during such fiscal year, the date on which we issue more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt securities in a three-year period, or the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of this offering.\nUnder the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nWe are taking advantage of exemptions from various other requirements that are available to emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved, and exemptions from the requirements of auditor attestation reports on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We cannot predict whether investors will find our common stock less attractive to the extent we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nWe are subject to financial and other reporting and corporate governance requirements that may be difficult for us to satisfy. Corporate governance and public disclosure regulations may result in additional expenses and continuing uncertainty.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and the rules and regulations of the New York Stock Exchange, which will impose significant compliance obligations upon us, particularly after we are no longer an emerging growth company. These obligations will require a commitment of additional resources and divert our senior management\u2019s time and attention from our day-to-day operations. We may not be successful in complying with these obligations, and compliance with these obligations will be time-consuming and expensive.\nThe Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and operating results. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. We are continuing the costly process of implementing and testing our systems to report our results as a public company, to continue to manage our growth and to implement internal controls. We are and will continue to be required to implement and maintain various other control and business systems related to our equity, finance, treasury, information technology, other recordkeeping systems and other operations. As a result of this implementation and maintenance, management\u2019s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could adversely affect our business.\nIn addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to their application and practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be adversely affected.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research or reports about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will, to some extent, depend on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us and our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our common stock or change their opinion of our common stock, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nOur charter documents and Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or change in our management that stockholders consider favorable and cause our stock price to decline.\nCertain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or change in our management that the stockholders of our company consider favorable. These provisions:\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that our board of directors could issue to increase the number of outstanding shares and to discourage a takeover attempt;\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent, requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice procedures for nominating candidates to our board of directors or proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nlimit the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholders from cumulating their votes for the election of directors;\n\u2022\npermit newly-created directorships resulting from an increase in the authorized number of directors or vacancies on our board of directors to be filled only by majority vote of our remaining directors, even if less than a quorum is then in office;\n\u2022\nprovide that our board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our amended and restated bylaws;\n\u2022\nestablish a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board are elected at one time;\n\u2022\nprovide that our directors may be removed only for \u201ccause\u201d and only with the approval of the holders of at least 75% of our outstanding stock; and\n\u2022\nrequire super-majority voting to amend certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws.\nSection 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which will apply to us, may also discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company.\nWe may not be able to obtain capital when desired on favorable terms, if at all, or without dilution to our stockholders.\nWe may need additional financing to execute on our current or future business strategies, including to:\n\u2022\nhire additional personnel;\n\u2022\ndevelop new or enhance existing products and services;\n\u2022\nexpand our operating infrastructure;\n\u2022\nacquire businesses or technologies; or\n\u2022\notherwise respond to competitive pressures.\nIf we incur additional funds through debt financing, a substantial portion of our operating cash flow may be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on such indebtedness, thus limiting funds available for our business activities. We cannot assure you that additional financing will be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms when we desire them, our ability to fund our operations, take advantage of unanticipated opportunities, develop or enhance our products and services, or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage ownership of our stockholders could be significantly diluted, and these newly-issued securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing stockholders.", "PERMNO": 14723, "SIC": 7372, "TIC": "IMPR"}
