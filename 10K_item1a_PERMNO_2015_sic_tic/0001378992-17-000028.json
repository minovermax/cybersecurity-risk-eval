{"cik": "1378992", "company": "BERRY GLOBAL GROUP INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-11-21", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nOur substantial indebtedness could affect our ability to meet our obligations and may otherwise restrict our activities.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness, which requires significant interest payments. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms, would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur substantial indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, it could:\n\uf0b7\nlimit our ability to borrow money for our working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements or other corporate purposes;\n\uf0b7\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; and\n\uf0b7\nlimit our ability to respond to business opportunities, including growing our business through acquisitions.\nIn addition, the credit agreements and indentures governing our current indebtedness contain, and any future debt instruments would likely contain, financial and other restrictive covenants. As a result of these covenants, we could be limited in the manner in which we conduct our business, and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs. Furthermore, a failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIncreases in resin prices or a shortage of available resin could harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nTo produce our products, we use large quantities of plastic resins. Plastic resins are subject to price fluctuations, including those arising from supply shortages and changes in the prices of natural gas, crude oil and other petrochemical intermediates from which resins are produced. Historically, we have been able to successfully manage the impact of higher raw material costs by increasing our selling prices. However, raw material inflation could materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability in the short term as we attempt to pass through price increases to our customers and in the long term as our customers could seek alternative solutions. We may not be able to arrange for other sources of resin in the event of an industry-wide general shortage of resins used by us, or a shortage or discontinuation of certain types of grades of resin purchased from one or more of our suppliers. Any such shortage may materially negatively impact our competitive position versus companies that are able to better or more cheaply source resin.\nWe may not be able to compete successfully and our customers may not continue to purchase our products.\nWe compete with multiple companies in each of our product lines on the basis of a number of considerations, including price, service, quality, product characteristics and the ability to supply products to customers in a timely manner. Our products also compete with metal, glass, paper, cloth, and other materials. Some of these competitive products are not subject to the impact of changes in resin prices, which may have a significant and negative impact on our competitive position versus substitute products. Our competitors may have financial and other resources that are substantially greater than ours and may be better able than us to withstand higher costs. Competition could result in our products losing market share or our having to reduce our prices, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, since we do not have long-term arrangements with many of our customers, these competitive factors could cause our customers to shift suppliers and/or packaging material quickly. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to respond timely to customer and market changes.\nWe may pursue and execute acquisitions, which could adversely affect our business.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we consider acquisitions that either complement or expand our existing business and create economic value. We cannot assure you that we will be able to consummate any future acquisitions at acceptable prices and terms. Acquired businesses may not achieve the levels of revenue, profit, productivity or otherwise perform as we expect. Acquisitions involve special risks, including the potential assumption of unanticipated liabilities and contingencies as well as difficulties in integrating acquired businesses creating substantial costs, delays or other problems that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, we may not realize all of the synergies we expect to achieve from our current strategic initiatives due to a variety of risks. If we are unable to achieve the synergies that we expect to achieve from our strategic initiatives, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, while we execute these acquisitions and related integration activities, it is possible that our attention may be diverted from our ongoing operations which may have a negative impact on our ongoing operations.\nCurrent and future environmental and other governmental requirements could adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to conduct our business.\nWhile we have not been required historically to make significant capital expenditures in order to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations, we cannot predict our future capital expenditure requirements because of continually changing compliance standards and environmental technology. Furthermore, violations or contaminated sites that we do not know about (including contamination caused by prior owners and operators of such sites or newly discovered information) could result in additional compliance or remediation costs or other liabilities, which could be material. We may also assume significant environmental liabilities in connection with acquisitions. In addition, federal, state, local, and foreign governments could enact laws or regulations concerning environmental matters that increase the cost of producing, or otherwise adversely affect the demand for, plastic products. Legislation that would prohibit, tax or restrict the sale or use of certain types of plastic and other containers, and would require diversion of solid waste such as packaging materials from disposal in landfills, has been or may be introduced in the U.S. Congress, state legislatures, and other legislative bodies. Although we believe that any such laws promulgated to date have not had a material adverse effect on us, there can be no assurance that future legislation or regulation would not have a material adverse effect on us. Furthermore, a decline in consumer preference for plastic products due to environmental considerations could have a negative effect on our business.\nBoth the FDA and the CPSC can require the manufacturer of defective products to repurchase or recall these products and may also impose fines or penalties on the manufacturer. Similar laws exist in some states, cities and other countries in which we sell products. Although we believe our products are in material compliance with all applicable requirements, any fines and penalties imposed in connection with noncompliance or recall of any of our products could have a materially adverse effect on us. See \"Business-Environmental Matters and Government Regulation.\"\nIn the event of a catastrophic loss of one of our key manufacturing facilities, our business would be adversely affected.\nWhile we manufacture our products in a large number of diversified facilities and maintain insurance covering our facilities, including business interruption insurance, a catastrophic loss of the use of all or a portion of one of our key manufacturing facilities due to accident, labor issues, weather conditions, natural disaster or otherwise, whether short or long-term, could have a material adverse effect on us.\nEmployee slowdowns or strikes or the failure to renew collective bargaining agreements could disrupt our business.\nAs of September 30, 2017, approximately 20% of our employees are represented by labor unions or trade councils and worked under collective bargaining agreements. We may not be able to maintain constructive relationships with these labor unions or trade councils. We may not be able to successfully negotiate new collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms in the future. The loss of a substantial number of these employees or a prolonged labor dispute could disrupt our business. Any such disruption could reduce our revenues, increase our costs and result in significant losses.\nWe depend on information technology systems and infrastructure to operate our business, system inadequacies or failures could harm our business.\nWe rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of information technology systems and networks. These systems and networks are potentially vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources, including energy or telecommunications failures, breakdowns, natural disasters, terrorism, war, computer malware or other malicious intrusions, and random attacks. To date, system interruptions have been infrequent and have not had a material impact on the business. However, there can be no assurance that these efforts will prevent future interruptions that would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nGoodwill and other intangibles represent a significant amount of our net worth, and a future write-off could result in lower reported net income and a reduction of our net worth.\nWe are required to evaluate goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets reflected on our balance sheet when circumstances indicate a potential impairment, or at least annually, under the impairment testing guidelines outlined in the standard. Future changes in the market multiples, cost of capital, expected cash flows, or other factors may cause our goodwill to be impaired, resulting in a non-cash charge against results of operations to write off goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets for the amount of impairment. If a future write-off is required, the charge could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated net income in the period of any such write off.\nDisruptions in the overall economy and the financial markets may adversely impact our business.\nOur industry is affected by macroeconomic factors, including national, regional, and local economic conditions, employment levels, and shifts in consumer spending patterns. Disruptions in the overall economy and volatility in the financial markets could reduce consumer confidence in the economy, negatively affecting consumer spending, which could be harmful to our financial position and results of operations. In such event, decreased cash flow generated from our business may adversely affect our financial position and our ability to fund our operations. In addition, major macroeconomic disruptions involving the financial markets could adversely affect our ability to access the credit markets and availability of financing for our operations.\nWe are a holding company and rely on dividends and other payments, advances and transfers of funds from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations and pay dividends.\nBerry Global Group, Inc. has no direct operations and no significant assets other than ownership of 100% of the stock of Berry Global Corporation. Because Berry Global Group, Inc. conducts its operations through its subsidiaries, it depends on those entities for dividends and other payments to generate the funds necessary to meet its financial obligations, and to pay any dividends with respect to our common stock. Legal and contractual restrictions in the agreements governing current and future indebtedness of Berry Global Group, Inc.'s subsidiaries, as well as the financial condition and operating requirements of Berry Global Group, Inc.'s subsidiaries, may limit Berry Global Group, Inc.'s ability to obtain cash from its subsidiaries. The earnings from, or other available assets of, Berry Global Group, Inc.'s subsidiaries may not be sufficient to pay dividends or make distributions or loans to enable Berry Global Group, Inc. to pay dividends going forward.\nOur international operations pose risks to our business that may not be present with our domestic operations.\nWe may continue to expand operations in foreign countries where we have an existing presence or enter new foreign markets and expect to increase sales of products as disposable income increases in developing markets. Foreign operations are subject to certain risks that are unique to doing business in foreign countries. These risks include fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, inflation, economic or political instability, shipping delays in both our products and receiving delays of raw materials, changes in applicable laws, including assessments of income and non-income related taxes, reduced protection of intellectual property and regulatory policies and various trade restrictions including potential changes to export taxes or countervailing and anti-dumping duties for exported products from these countries. Any of these risks could have a negative impact on our ability to deliver products to customers on a competitive and timely basis. This could reduce or impair our net sales, profits, cash flows and financial position. We are also subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-bribery laws that generally bar bribes or unreasonable gifts to foreign governments or officials. We have implemented safeguards and policies to discourage these practices by our employees and agents. However, our existing safeguards and policies to assure compliance and any future improvements may prove to be less than effective and our employees or agents may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible. If employees violate our policies, we may be subject to regulatory sanctions. Violations of these laws or regulations could result in sanctions including fines, debarment from export privileges and penalties and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe hold cash and cash equivalents at various foreign subsidiaries that may not be readily available to meet U.S. cash requirements.\nOur various foreign subsidiaries hold cash and cash equivalents and these balances held outside the U.S. may not be readily available to meet our domestic cash requirements. If we are unable to meet our U.S. cash requirements using cash flows from U.S. operations, cash and cash equivalents held in the U.S., or by settling loans receivable with our foreign subsidiaries, it may be necessary for us to consider repatriation of earnings held outside the U.S. This may require us to record additional income tax expense and remit additional taxes, which could have a material effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be successful in protecting our intellectual property rights, including our unpatented proprietary know-how and trade secrets, or in avoiding claims that we infringed on the intellectual property rights of others.\nIn addition to relying on patent and trademark rights, we rely on unpatented proprietary know-how and trade secrets, and employ various methods, including confidentiality agreements with employees and consultants, customers and suppliers to protect our know-how and trade secrets. However, these methods and our patents and trademarks may not afford complete protection and there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop the know-how and trade secrets or develop better production methods than us. Further, we may not be able to deter current and former employees, contractors and other parties from breaching agreements and misappropriating proprietary information and it is possible that third parties may copy or otherwise obtain and use our information and proprietary technology without authorization or otherwise infringe on our intellectual property rights. Furthermore, no assurance can be given that we will not be subject to claims asserting the infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties seeking damages, the payment of royalties or licensing fees and/or injunctions against the sale of our products. Any such litigation could be protracted and costly and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nNew and stricter legislation and regulations may affect our business and consolidated financial condition and results of operations.\nIncreased legislative and regulatory activity and burdens, and a more stringent manner in which they are applied (particularly in the U.S.), could significantly impact our business and the economy as a whole. This includes, among other things, proposed tax reform in the U.S. which may result in significant changes to U.S. tax rules, compliance costs and enforcement under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, compliance costs and enforcement under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and costs associated with complying with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder.\nWe may not be able to achieve cost savings as a result of our restructuring efforts and productivity and cost reduction initiatives.\nFrom time to time we enter into cost reduction plans designed to deliver cost savings and improve equipment utilization. Our ability to achieve the anticipated cost savings and other benefits from these initiatives within the expected time frame is subject to many estimates and assumptions. Additionally, there are many factors which affect our ability to achieve savings as a result of productivity and cost reduction initiatives, such as difficult economic conditions, increased costs in other areas, the effects of and costs related to newly acquired entities, mistaken assumptions, and the other risk factors set forth herein. In addition, any actual savings may be balanced by incremental costs that were not foreseen at the time of the restructuring or cost reduction initiatives. As a result, anticipated savings may not be achieved on the timetable desired or at all. Additionally, while we execute these restructuring activities to achieve these savings, it is possible that our attention may be diverted from our ongoing operations which may have a negative impact on our ongoing operations.\nThe Clopay transaction is subject to conditions that may not be satisfied or completed on a timely basis, if at all; failure to complete the Clopay transaction could negatively impact our stock price and our future financial results.\nCompletion of the Clopay transaction is subject to a number of conditions, each of which, unless waived, must be fulfilled in order to complete the transaction. The conditions to the closing of the transaction may not be fulfilled in a timely manner or at all, and, accordingly, the transaction may be delayed or may not be completed. Although we expect to complete the Clopay transaction in early calendar 2018, the actual closing date will depend on the satisfaction or waiver of the applicable closing conditions. Any delay in the completion of the Clopay transaction would defer our ability to realize the intended benefits of the Clopay transaction.", "PERMNO": 13604, "SIC": 3080, "TIC": "BERY"}
