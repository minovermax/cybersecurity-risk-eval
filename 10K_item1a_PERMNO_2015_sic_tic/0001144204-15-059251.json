{"cik": "1099290", "company": "Hongli Clean Energy Technologies Corp.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-10-13", "item_1A": "Item 1a. Risk Factors\nThe reader should carefully consider the risks described below together with all of the other information included in this Report. The statements contained in or incorporated into this Report that are not historic facts are forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in or implied by forward-looking statements. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be harmed. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and an investor in our securities may lose all or part of their investment.\nRisks Related To Our Business\nIf we cannot continue as a going concern, you will lose your entire investment.\nIn their report in connection with our financial statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, our independent registered public accounting firm included an explanatory paragraph stating that because we reported a working capital deficit in the amount to $25,400,753, there is substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. If we cannot continue as a going concern, your entire investment may be worthless. Our ability to continue as a going concern will depend, in large part, on our ability to obtain financing or extend the terms of our existing financing, renew our current loans, and to increase sales of our higher profit margin coke and syngas, none of which prospect is certain.\nIf we do not raise additional capital or refinance our debt, we will not be able to achieve our objectives and we may need to curtail or even discontinue operations.\nAt June 30, 2015, our current assets exceeded current liabilities by over $25.4 million, including $42.2 million that we owe Bairui Trust Co., Ltd. (\u201cBairu Trust\u201d). On September 18, 2014, we sold 2,818,845 shares of our common stock for $14.3 million. However, our cash flow from operating activities during the year ended June 30, 2014 was only an inflow of $530,514 and our cash balance was $0.01 million as of June 30, 2015, compared to our short-term loans of $44.5 million which will be due in the next 12 months. Our ability to continue as a going concern depends upon our expenditure requirements and repayments of our short-term and long-term loan facilities with Bairui Trust as and when they become due. At present, we have no firm commitments for investment capital and no debt facilities. Additional capital may not be available to us or may be available only on terms that are unfavorable. If capital is not available on satisfactory terms, or is not available at all, we may be unable to continue to fully develop our business. In addition, our results of operations may decline from previous levels or may fail to meet expectations. As a result, the price of our publicly traded securities may decline, causing you to lose all or part of your investment.\nOur business and results of operations are dependent on China's coal and coke markets, which may be cyclical.\nSince our principal revenue source is from the sale of coal and coke in China, our business and operating results are highly dependent on China\u2019s supplies and demands. The Chinese coal and coke markets are cyclical and exhibit fluctuation in supply and demand from year to year. They are subject to numerous factors beyond our control, including, but not limited to, general economic conditions in the PRC and fluctuations in industries with high demand for coal, such as the power and steel industries. These factors are also linked to or influenced by global economic conditions. Supply and demand fluctuations can affect prices, which in turn affect our operating and financial performance. We have seen substantial price fluctuations in the past and believe that such fluctuations may continue. Demand is primarily influenced by the pace of domestic economic growth and development, as measured by the requirements of the power, steel, and construction industries. Supply, on the other hand, is primarily affected by geography, the domestic and international production volumes, tariffs duties and trade controls, value-added taxes imposed on imports, and international freight costs. Alternative fuels such as natural gas, oil and nuclear power, and alternative energy sources, such as hydroelectric power, wind, geothermal and solar, also have influences on supply and demand. Excess supply or significant reduction in demand can adversely affect pricing, which would in turn cause a significant decline in our profitability.\nOur coal and coke operations are inherently subject to changing conditions that can affect our profitability.\nOur coal and coke operations are inherently subject to changing conditions that can affect levels of production and production costs for varying lengths of time and can result in decreases in profitability. We are exposed to commodity price risk related to the purchase of diesel fuel, wood, explosives and steel. In addition, weather and natural disasters (such as earthquakes, landslides, flooding, and other similar occurrences), unexpected maintenance problems, key equipment failures, fires, variations in thickness of the layer, or seam, of coal, amounts of overburden, rock and other natural materials, variations in rock and other natural materials and variations in geological conditions can be expected in the future to have a significant impact on our operating results. Prolonged disruption of production at the mines would result in a decrease in our revenues and profitability, which could be material (see \u201cWe may not be able to resume our coal mining operations in the near future\u201d below). Other factors affecting coal and coke production and/or sale that could adversely affect our profitability include:\n\u00b7 changes in the laws and/or regulations that we are subject to, including permitting, safety, labor and environmental requirements; and\n\u00b7 labor shortages.\nOur coal and coke operations are extensively regulated by the PRC government and government regulations may limit its activities and adversely affect its business operations.\nOur coal and coke operations, like those of other Chinese natural resources and energy companies, are subject to extensive regulations administered by the PRC government. Central governmental authorities, such as the National Development and Reform Commission, the State Environmental Protection Administration, the Ministry of Land and Resources, the State Administration of Coal Mine Safety, the State Bureau of Taxation, and provincial and local authorities and agencies exercise extensive control over various aspects of our industry, which affect the following material aspects of our operations:\n\u00b7 exploration, exploitation and mining rights and licensing;\n\u00b7 rehabilitation of mining sites after mining is completed;\n\u00b7 recovery rate requirements;\n\u00b7 industry-specific taxes and fees;\n\u00b7 target of our capital investments;\n\u00b7 pension funds appropriation; and\n\u00b7 environmental and safety standards.\nWe believe that our operations are in compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements in all material respects. However, there can be no assurance that the central, provincial or local governments in the PRC will not impose new, stricter regulations or interpretations of existing regulations that would require additional expenditures by us to comply (see \u201cWe may not be able to resume our coal mining operations in the near future\u201d below). We may face significant constraints on our ability to implement our business strategies or to carry out or expand business operations. We may also be materially and adversely affected by future changes in certain regulations and policies of the PRC government in respect of the coal or coke industry. New legislation or regulations may be adopted that may materially and adversely affect our operations, our cost structure or demand for our products. In addition, new legislation or regulations or different or more stringent interpretation of existing laws and regulations may also require us to substantially change our existing operations or incur significant costs.\nWe may not be able to resume our coal mining operations.\nWith the PRC government\u2019s increasing concern regarding mine safety issues, particularly in light of several recent accidental explosions in coal mines (operated by other companies) due to inadequate internal safety measures, and the implementation of the State Council\u2019s Regulation on Phase-out of Small Coal Mines, industry-wide coal mine safety inspections have been ongoing in Henan since June 2010. During the course of these inspections, all coal mines in Henan have been shut down. We continued to operate our only mine at that time, Hongchang coal mine, at approximately 50% capacity until September 2011, when we halted operation in order to complete certain engineering and safety upgrades. Operations at our other three mines (Shuangrui, Xingsheng and Shunli) were already halted when we acquired controlling interests in them in May 2011, and have not resumed since (see \u201cOur Products and Operations - Coal - Coal Mining Moratorium\u201d above). At this time, we do not know whether or when we can obtain clearance to resume operations at these mines.\nSuch interruption to our coal mining operations has had a material and adverse effect on our financial results and operations. Moreover, additional new legislation or regulations may be adopted, or the enforcement of existing laws could become more stringent, either of which may have a significant impact on our mining operations or customers\u2019 ability to use coal and may require our customers to significantly change operations or to incur substantial costs.\nOur future success may depend substantially upon our ability to complete and operate the new coking plant.\nA central element of our business plan involves the construction and operation of our new coking plant. As of the date of this Report, however, construction has not yet been completed. As of June 30, 2015, total amount due for the plant\u2019s construction was approximately $96.5 million, of which approximately $72.9 million has been paid, and the remaining $23.6 million will be paid based on construction progress. In light of downturns in the coke market, however, we have had stoppages previously, and have currently slowed down construction. While we intend to resume construction at full pace when market conditions improve, there can be no assurance as to when that will occur.\nOur business operations may be adversely affected by present or future environmental regulations.\nAs a producer of coal and coke products, we are subject to significant, extensive, and increasingly stringent environmental protection laws and regulations in China. These laws and regulations:\n\u00b7 impose fees for the discharge of waste substances;\n\u00b7 require the establishment of reserves for reclamation and rehabilitation;\n\u00b7 require the payment of fines for serious environmental offences; and\n\u00b7 allow the Chinese government, at its discretion, to close any facility that fails to comply with environmental regulations or government orders.\nOur operations produce waste water, gas and solid waste materials. Currently, the PRC government is moving toward more rigorous enforcement of applicable laws and regulations as well as the adoption and enforcement of more stringent environmental standards. Our current expenditure for environmental regulatory compliance may not be sufficient if additional regulations are imposed and we may need to allocate additional funds for such purpose. If we fail to comply with current or future environmental laws and regulations, we may be required to pay penalties or fines or take corrective actions, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, China is a signatory to the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which are intended to limit emissions of greenhouse gases. Efforts to control greenhouse gas emission in China could result in reduced use of coal and coke if customers switch to sources of fuel with lower carbon dioxide emissions, which in turn could reduce the revenues of our businesses and have a material adverse effect on results of operations.\nDemand for coal and coke and their respective prices are closely linked to consumption patterns of the power and steel industries in China. Any changes in consumption patterns could affect our operations and profitability.\nDemand for coal and coke and the prices that we will be able to obtain for these products are closely linked to consumption patterns of the power generation and steel industries in China. These consumption patterns are influenced by factors beyond our control, including the demand for electricity; demand for steel; government regulation; technological developments and the location, availability, quality and price of competing sources of coal and coke; alternative fuels, such as natural gas, oil and nuclear power, and alternative energy sources, such as hydroelectric power, wind, geothermal and solar. Any reduction in the demand for coal or coke by the domestic power and steel industries may cause a decline in demand and revenue from our products which would reduce our profitability. For much of fiscal 2014 and 2015, the steel industry especially has suffered from tighter governmental control of real estate and land developments, resulting in a soft coke market. Likewise, the general slowdown in the Chinese economy has negatively impacted the coal market.\nIf transportation becomes unavailable or uneconomic for our customers, our ability to sell coal or coke could suffer.\nTransportation costs represent a significant portion of the total cost of coal and, as a result, the cost of transportation is a critical factor in a customer\u2019s purchasing decision. Increases in transportation costs could make our products a less competitive source of energy or could make some of our offerings less competitive than other sources of coal or coke. We rely upon trucking, national, provincial and local highways and roadways, and the national railway system to transport our products. Regulation of, and the overall cost of using these forms of transportation may be outside of our control. Further changes in the accessibility and cost of these forms of transportation could affect our ability to deliver our products to our customers, and which, in turn, could affect the attractiveness of our products relative to competing alternatives. In addition, these modes of transportation depend upon the support of the national, provincial and local governments for their maintenance and operation, and their reliability will depend on the actions and resources of these governments.\nRisks inherent to mining could increase the cost of operating our business.\nOur mining operations are subject to conditions beyond our control that can delay coal deliveries or increase the cost of mining for varying lengths of time. These conditions include weather and natural disasters (such as earthquakes, landslides, flooding, and other similar occurrences), unexpected maintenance problems, key equipment failures, fires, variations in thickness of the layer, or seam, of coal, amounts of overburden, rock and other natural materials, variations in rock and other natural materials and variations in geological conditions.\nAs with all companies that have coal mining operations, our operations are affected by mining conditions such as a deterioration in the quality or thickness of faults and/or coal seams, pressure in mine openings, presence of gas and/or water inflow and propensity to spontaneous combustion, as well as operational risks associated with industrial or engineering activity, such as mechanical breakdowns. Although we have conducted geological investigations to evaluate such mining conditions and adapt our mining plans to address them, there can be no assurance that the occurrence of any adverse mining conditions would not result in an increase in our costs of production, a reduction of coal output or the temporary suspension of operations.\nWe may suffer losses resulting from industry-related accidents and lack of insurance.\nWe operate coal mines and related facilities that may be affected by water, gas, fire or structural problems. As a result, our operations, like other coal mining and coking companies, could experience accidents that cause property damage and personal injuries. Although we have implemented safety measures at our operations, and provide on-the-job training for our employees, and, in accordance with relevant laws set aside approximately 9.6% of employees\u2019 total remuneration for employees\u2019 health insurance, there can be no assurance that industry-related accidents will not occur in the future.\nWe currently do not maintain fire, or other property insurance covering our properties, equipment or inventories. In addition, we do not maintain any business interruption insurance or any third party liability insurance to cover claims in respect of personal injury, property or environmental damage arising from accidents on our properties. Any uninsured losses and liabilities incurred by us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. For instance, if it occurred, a major mining accident could prompt government-mandated closure of some or all of our mining operations, which would then require us to spend significant resources on remediation which could consume our available capital resources. Further, until such remediation is completed, we would be required to obtain our raw coal inputs from other third party suppliers at a higher price, which would adversely affect our gross margins on coal and coke products. Although the likelihood of a major mining accident is extremely difficult to predict, we note that we have never suffered a casualty or major mining-related accident since inception, we have never been found to be out of compliance with government safety standards, and management believes our mining operations are safer than the industry average in China.\nOur ability to operate effectively could be impaired if we lose key personnel or fail to attract qualified personnel.\nOur business is managed by a number of key personnel, the loss of any of which could have a material adverse effect on operations. In addition, as business develops and expands, we believe that our future success will depend greatly on our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel. We cannot assure that key personnel will continue to be employed by us or that we will be able to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future. We employ our key personnel on an at-will basis, which means that either the Company or the employee may generally terminate the employment relationship at any time for any reason. Accordingly, if we are not able to effectively fill vacancies of departing key persons, our business may be impaired. Further, we note that our management is heavily dependent on the skills, experience, contacts, and business relationships of our founder and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Jianhua Lv. Accordingly, the loss of Mr. Lv could cause significant impairment to the business of our Company.\nA downturn in global economic conditions may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur business and results of operations are affected by international, national and regional economic conditions. Financial markets in the United States, Europe and Asia have experienced significant disruption in the past year, including among other things, heightened volatility in security prices, constrained liquidity and credit availability, rating downgrades of certain investments and declining values of others. We are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of the current disruptions in financial markets, credit availability, and adverse economic conditions throughout the world. These economic developments affect businesses in a number of ways that could result in unfavorable consequences to us. Adverse global economic conditions, including within the PRC, could negatively affect commodity prices, or may cause our current or potential customers to delay or reduce purchases which could, in turn, result in reductions in sales volumes or prices, materially and adversely affecting results of operations and cash flows. Volatility and disruption of global financial markets could limit our customers' abilities to obtain adequate financing to maintain operations and proceed with planned or new capital spending initiatives, leading to a reduction in sales volume that could materially and adversely affect results of operations and cash flow. In addition, a decline in our customers' abilities to pay as a result of an economic downturn may lead to increased difficulties in the collection of accounts receivable, higher levels of reserves for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable, and higher operating costs as a percentage of revenues.\nCertain of our shareholders control a significant amount of our common stock.\nAs of October 12, 2015, approximately 33% of our outstanding common stock was controlled by our founder and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Jianhua Lv, and one holding entity, of which Mr. Jianhua Lv is a director and beneficiary. Accordingly, Mr. Lv presently has significant relative voting power and influence over any action requiring shareholder approval, including the election of our directors.\nOur acquisitions may disrupt or have a negative impact on our business.\nWe could have difficulty integrating personnel and operations of Shuangrui Coal, Xingsheng Coal and Shunli Coal with our own. In addition, their key personnel may not be willing to work for us. In addition to the risks described above, acquisitions are accompanied by a number of inherent risks, including, without limitation, the following:\n\u00b7 the effect of any government regulations which relate to the business acquired;\n\u00b7 delays and waiting periods associated with required safety inspections, as well as government licensing or permitting procedures;\n\u00b7 difficulties in disposing of the excess or idle facilities of an acquired company or business and expenses in maintaining such facilities;\n\u00b7 difficulties in maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies;\n\u00b7 the potential impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of any integration of new management personnel;\n\u00b7 potential unknown liabilities associated with acquired businesses and the associated operations, or the need to spend significant amounts to retool, reposition or modify the existing operations; and\n\u00b7 the defense of any litigation, whether or not successful, resulting from actions of the acquired company prior to the acquisition.\nFor instance, as a required part of the process of consolidating mines in China, a consolidator is required to undergo safety inspections which apply to its existing and operating mines as well as acquired mines. These government inspections, as well as the required permitting and permitting process, may require substantial time to complete, and this may cause interruptions our coal mining operations. In light of the mining moratorium, we do not know when such clearance will be issued, if at all (see \u201cOur Products and Operations - Coal - Coal Mining Moratorium\u201d above). Further, if safety issues are identified by government mine inspection authorities, we may be required to undertake costly and time-consuming remedial measures in order to restore production.\nOur business could be impaired to the extent that management is unable to succeed in addressing any of these risks or other problems encountered in connection with these acquisitions, many of which cannot be presently identified, these risks and problems could disrupt our ongoing business, distract the management and employees, increase our expenses and adversely affect our results of operations.\nA large portion of our current revenue is derived from relatively few customers.\nWe depended on four major customers for a substantial portion of our revenue in fiscal 2015. Nonrenewal or termination of our arrangements with these customers may have a materially adverse effect on our revenue. In the event that any one of our major customers does not renew or terminates its arrangement with us, there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into another arrangement similar in scope. Additionally, there can be no assurance that our business will not remain largely dependent on a limited customer base accounting for a substantial portion of revenue.\nOur future success in engaging in the UCG field operation and applying our UCG technique to all of our current coal mines depends substantially upon sufficient working capital to develop the project, final approval from the supervisors of the project, economic efficiency of the facility and achievement of economic feasibility from the UCG technique development.\nOn August 28, 2014, we entered into a cooperative agreement with the North China Institute of Science and Technology regarding UCG development to refine and implement advanced techniques to convert our coal into syngas. Our ultimate target is to build a UCG facility with an annual production capacity of 7,708,800,000 cubic meters of syngas or 880,000 cubic meters of syngas per hour in all four of our coal mines. The UCG project was approved by the Science and Technology Bureau of Baofeng County as a local Scientific and Technological Practical Project, and it was granted the privilege to refine the coal under Baofeng Coking Factory as a trial project for UCG technique development. We commenced the construction of the trial project in June 2015. This UCG trial project is under supervision of the Science and Technology Bureau of Baofeng County and North China Institute of Science and Technology (\u201cSupervisors\u201d) and requires further tests and approval from the Supervisors upon our completion of construction and equipment installation. This UCG trial project is divided into several stages and each stage requires a periodical acceptance test conducted by the Supervisors. It is anticipated that the construction of this trial project will be completed in March 2016, and is estimated to cost up to $5 million to complete construction. Once the construction is completed, it requires another 6 month of preliminary operations for final testing which will be monitored by the Supervisors. With the final approval from the Supervisors, we will be able to implement our UCG techniques in our coal mines. There is no guarantee that we can have sufficient working capital to support our UCG project, achieve economic feasibility from the UCG technique development, reach economic efficiency of the facility, or obtain final approval from the Supervisors to implement our UCG techniques in our coal mines. Missing anyone of the above targets could adversely impact our ability to continuously engage in the UCG field and resume our coal mine operations, as well as cause a significant losses to our operations.\nOur syngas operation and development could suffer from a limited distribution area and lack of customers.\nAt the time of this filing, the gas pipeline network extends only 10 kilometers from our existing syngas facilities. As a result of the limited distribution area of our syngas, we only had three customers in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015. Since August 2015, we are down to one customer as some of our customers\u2019 factories have closed temporarily or shut down. The limited distribution area of syngas not only adversely affects our customer base, but also restricts and slows our syngas development. For example, the expansion plans for our syngas facilities in Shilong District, Pingdingshan City have been delayed because of the limited gas pipeline network. The head of the Shilong District government orally indicated they would provide us some assistance when we extend our gas pipeline network to merge into the pipeline network owned by the country. If we succeed in extending our pipeline to merge into the network owned by the country, we will have a broader customer base and be able to distribute our syngas to locations outside of Pingdingshan, which is beneficial for our syngas operation development. Due to the matters relating to working capital support, pipeline construction, and application and approval by the government, we have not merged our pipeline into the network owned by the country as of the date of this filing. But we are in the process of negotiating with the government of Pingdingshan City regarding the related matters. We hope to be able to merge our current pipeline network with the network owned by the government soon. However, there is no guarantee that we can accomplish that. At date of this filing, the gas pipeline network has not been extended yet.\nRisks Related to Our Corporate Structure\nIf the Chinese government determines that the contractual arrangements through which we control Hongli do not comply with applicable regulations, our business could be adversely affected. If the PRC regulatory bodies determine that such agreements do not comply with PRC regulatory restrictions on foreign investment, we could be subject to severe penalties. In addition, changes in such Chinese laws and regulations may materially and adversely affect our business.\nThere are uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of PRC laws, rules and regulations, including but not limited to the laws, rules and regulations governing the validity and enforcement of the contractual arrangements between Hongyuan and Hongli. Although we have been advised by our PRC counsel that based on their understanding of the current PRC laws, rules and regulations, the contractual arrangements with Hongli and its owners, as well our ability to enforce our rights thereunder, comply with all applicable PRC laws, rules and regulations, and do not violate, breach, contravene or otherwise conflict with any applicable PRC laws, rules or regulations, we cannot assure you that the PRC regulatory authorities will not determine that our corporate structure and contractual arrangements violate PRC laws, rules or regulations. If the PRC regulatory authorities determine that our contractual arrangements are in violation of applicable PRC laws, rules or regulations, they will become invalid or unenforceable. In addition, new PRC laws, rules and regulations may be introduced from time to time to impose additional requirements that may be applicable to our contractual arrangements.\nThe Chinese government has broad discretion in dealing with violations of laws and regulations, including levying fines, revoking business and other licenses and requiring actions necessary for compliance. In particular, licenses and permits issued or granted to us by relevant governmental bodies may be revoked at a later time by higher regulatory bodies. We cannot predict the effect of the interpretation of existing or new Chinese laws or regulations on our businesses. We cannot assure you that our current ownership and operating structure would not be found in violation of any current or future Chinese laws or regulations. As a result, we may be subject to sanctions, including fines, and could be required to restructure our operations or cease to provide certain services. Any of these or similar actions could significantly disrupt our business operations or restrict us from conducting a substantial portion of our business operations, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we, Hongyuan or Hongli are determined to be in violation of any existing or future PRC laws, rules or regulations or fail to obtain or maintain any of the required governmental permits or approvals, the relevant PRC regulatory authorities would have broad discretion in dealing with such violations, including:\n\u00b7 revoking the business and operating licenses of Hongli and/or voiding the contractual arrangements;\n\u00b7 discontinuing or restricting the operations of Hongli;\n\u00b7 imposing conditions or requirements with which we or Hongyuan or Hongli may not be able to comply;\n\u00b7 requiring us to restructure the relevant ownership structure or operations;\n\u00b7 restricting or prohibiting our use of the proceeds from our initial public offering to finance our business and operations in China; or\n\u00b7 imposing fines or other forms of economic penalties.\nAs we do not have direct ownership of Hongli, the imposition of any of these penalties may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIn addition, the Ministry of Commerce, or the MOFCOM, published a discussion draft of the proposed Foreign Investment Law in January 2015 aiming to, upon its enactment, replace the trio of existing laws regulating foreign investment in China, namely, the Sino-foreign Equity Joint Venture Enterprise Law, the Sino-foreign Cooperative Joint Venture Enterprise Law and the Wholly Foreign-invested Enterprise Law, together with their implementation rules and ancillary regulations. The draft Foreign Investment Law embodies an expected PRC regulatory trend to rationalize its foreign investment regulatory regime in line with prevailing international practice and the legislative efforts to unify the corporate legal requirements for both foreign and domestic investments. While the MOFCM solicited comments on this draft earlier this year, substantial uncertainties exist with respect to its enactment timetable, interpretation and implementation. The draft Foreign Investment Law, if enacted as proposed, may materially impact the entire legal framework regulating foreign investments in China and may also impact the viability of our current corporate structure, corporate governance, business operations and financial results to some extent.\nOur contractual arrangements with Hongli and its owners as well as our ability to enforce our rights thereunder may not be as effective in providing control over Hongli as direct ownership.\nWe have no equity ownership interest in Hongli, and rely on contractual arrangements to control the company. We cannot assure you that the Owners will always act in our best interests, and these contractual arrangements may not be as effective in providing control over the company as direct ownership. For example, Hongli could fail to take actions required for our business despite its contractual obligation to do so. If Hongli fails to perform under its agreements with us, we are required by the terms of these agreements to enforce our rights by arbitration before the China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission (\u201cCIETAC\u201d). According to the Rule of CIETA, to initiate such proceeding, we must first prepare and submit an arbitration request to CIETAC for its acceptance. Once accepted, CIETAC will form an arbitration tribunal to hear the matter, set a hearing date and notify Hongli of the proceeding. Hongli will have 45 days from the receipt of such notice to prepare its statement of defense. While we have been advised by our PRC counsel that current CIETAC rules requires a decision to be rendered within six months from the selection of the arbitration tribunal, the passage of any prolong period of time without resolution may disrupt and negatively affect our business operations. Further, we must borne half of CIETAC\u2019s fees in addition to our own expenses incurred to prepare for such proceeding, which fees may become prohibitively expensive as the arbitration must take place in Shanghai and be conducted in Chinese. As we are also contractually bound by CIETAC\u2019s decision, in the event such decision is unfavorable to us, we may effectively lose our control over Hongli, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial conditions and results of operations.\nManagement members of Hongli have potential conflicts of interest with us, which may adversely affect our business and your ability for recourse.\nMr. Jianhua Lv, our Chief Executive Officer, is also the Chairman of Hongli and owns 85.4% of its equity ownership interests. Conflict of interest between his duties to our company and Hongli may arise. As our director and executive officer, he has a duty of loyalty and care to us under U.S. law when there are any potential conflicts of interests between our company and Hongli. We cannot, however, assure you that when conflicts of interest arise, he will act completely in our interests, or that conflicts of interests will be resolved in our favor. For example, he may determine that it is in Hongli\u2019s interests to sever the contractual arrangements with Hongyuan irrespective of the effect such action may have on us. Because we derive our income entirely from the contractual arrangements with Hongli, we would have no or minimal operations and assets if these contractual arrangements are severed. In addition, Mr. Lv could violate his legal duties by diverting business opportunities from us to others, thereby reducing the amount of payment that Hongli is obligated to remit to us under the consulting services agreement.\nIn the event that you believe that your rights have been infringed under the U.S. securities laws or otherwise as a result of any one of the circumstances described above, it may be difficult or impossible for you to bring an action against Hongli or our officers or directors, all of whom reside within China. Even if you are successful in bringing an action, the laws of China may render you unable to enforce a judgment against the assets of Hongli and its management, all of which are located in China.\nOur principal shareholder may be subject to registration requirements under current regulations relating to offshore investment activities by PRC residents, the non-compliance of which may subject us to fines and sanctions that could adversely affect our business.\nIn October 2005 and June 2011, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (\u201cSAFE\u201d) promulgated the Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Control on Domestic Residents\u2019 Corporate Financing and Roundtrip Investment Through Offshore Special Purpose Vehicles, or Circular 75, and its implement rule, respectively, that state that if PRC citizens residing in the PRC, or PRC residents, use assets or equity interests in their PRC entities as capital contributions to establish offshore companies or inject assets or equity interests of their PRC entities into offshore companies to raise capital overseas, they must register with local SAFE branches with respect to their overseas investments in offshore companies. They must also file amendments to their registrations if their offshore companies experience material events involving capital variation, such as changes in share capital, share transfers, mergers and acquisitions, spin-off transactions, long-term equity or debt investments or uses of assets in China to guarantee offshore obligations. On July 4, 2014, SAFE issued the SAFE\u2019s Notice on Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Administration for PRC Residents to Engage in Outbound Investment and Financing and Inbound Investment via Special Purpose Vehicles (\u2018\u2018SPV\u2019\u2019), or SAFE Circular 37, which has superseded SAFE Circular 75. According to SAFE Circular 37, the PRC domestic resident shall apply for SAFE registration for overseas investment before paying capital to SPV by using his, her or its legal assets whether overseas or domestic. The SPV is defined as \u2018\u2018offshore enterprise directly established or indirectly controlled by the domestic residents (including domestic institutions and individuals) with their legally owned assets and equity of the domestic enterprise, or legally owned offshore assets or equity, for the purpose of offshore investment and financing\u2019\u2019. In addition, in the event that the SPV undergoes changes of its basic information such as the individual shareholder, name, operation term, etc., or material events including increase or decrease by domestic individual shareholder in investment amount, equity transfer or swap, merge, spin-off, etc., the domestic resident shall timely complete the change of foreign exchange registration formality for offshore investment. Under these regulations, the failure to comply with the registration procedures set forth in such regulation may result in restrictions being imposed on the foreign exchange activities of the relevant PRC entity, including the payment of dividends and other distributions to its offshore parent, as well as restrictions on the capital inflow from the offshore entity to the PRC entity. According to SAFE Circular 37, failure to make such registration or truthfully disclose actual controllers of the round-trip enterprises may subject PRC residents to fines up to RMB 300,000 in case of domestic institutions or RMB 50,000 in case of domestic individuals. Under these regulations, the failure to comply with the registration procedures set forth in such regulation may result in restrictions being imposed on the foreign exchange activities of the relevant PRC entity, including the payment of dividends and other distributions to its offshore parent, as well as restrictions on the capital inflow from the offshore entity to the PRC entity.\nRisks Related To Doing Business in China\nOur operations are primarily located in China and may be adversely affected by changes in the policies of the PRC government.\nThe political environment in the PRC and the policies of the PRC government may adversely affect our business operations. The PRC has operated as a socialist state since 1949. In recent years, however, the government has introduced economic reforms aimed at creating a \u201csocialist market economy\u201d and policies have been implemented to allow business enterprises greater autonomy in their operations. Changes in the political leadership of the PRC may have a significant effect on laws and policies related to the current economic reforms program, other policies affecting business and the general political, economic and social environment in the PRC, including the introduction of measures to control inflation, changes in the rate or method of taxation, the imposition of additional restrictions on currency conversion and remittances abroad, and foreign investment. These effects could substantially impair our business, profits or prospects. Moreover, economic reforms and growth in the PRC have been more successful in certain provinces than in others, and the continuation or increases of such disparities could affect the political or social stability of the PRC.\nThe PRC government exerts substantial influence over the manner in which companies in China must conduct their business activities.\nThe PRC only recently has permitted greater provincial and local economic autonomy and private economic activities. The government of the PRC has exercised and continues to exercise substantial control over virtually every sector of the Chinese economy through regulation and state ownership. Accordingly, government actions in the future, including any decision not to continue to support recent economic reforms and to return to a more centrally planned economy or regional or local variations in the implementation of economic policies, could have a significant effect on economic conditions in the PRC or particular regions thereof, and if this were to occur, we could be required to divest the interests we then hold in Chinese properties or joint-ventures. Any such developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition and prospects.\nFuture inflation in China may inhibit economic activity and adversely affect our operations.\nIn recent years, the Chinese economy has experienced periods of rapid expansion and within which some years with high rates of inflation and deflation, which have led to the adoption by the PRC government, from time to time, of various corrective measures designed to restrict the availability of credit or regulate growth and contain inflation. While inflation has moderated since 1995, high inflation may in the future cause the PRC government to impose controls on credit and/or prices, or to take other action, which could inhibit economic activity in China, and thereby adversely affect our business operations and prospects.\nWe may be unable to enforce our rights due to policies regarding the regulation of foreign investments in China.\nThe PRC\u2019s legal system is a civil law system based on written statutes in which decided legal cases have little value as precedents, unlike the common law system prevalent in the United States. The PRC does not have a well-developed, consolidated body of laws governing foreign investment enterprises. As a result, the administration of laws and regulations by government agencies may be subject to considerable discretion and variation, and may be subject to influence by external forces unrelated to the legal merits of a particular matter. China\u2019s regulations and policies with respect to foreign investments are evolving. Definitive regulations and policies with respect to such matters as the permissible percentage of foreign investment and permissible rates of equity returns have not yet been published. Statements regarding these evolving policies have been conflicting and any such policies, as administered, are likely to be subject to broad interpretation and discretion and to be modified, perhaps on a case-by-case basis. The uncertainties regarding such regulations and policies present risks that we will not be able to achieve our business objectives. There can be no assurance that we will be able to enforce any legal rights we may have under our contracts or otherwise.\nWe depend upon the acquisition and maintenance of licenses to conduct our business in the PRC.\nIn order to conduct business in the PRC, we need licenses from the appropriate government authorities, including general business licenses and licenses and/or permits specific to our industry. The loss or failure to obtain or maintain these licenses in full force and effect will have a material adverse impact on our ability to conduct our business and on our financial condition. Mining licenses in China are generally subject to periodic renewal, and license fees associated with renewal may be subject to negotiation between the Company and the relevant government authorities. The government may in the future decide to increase these fees, or impose levies or surcharges on coal mine and mining rights. No assurance can be given regarding the timing or magnitude of these types of government actions.\nPrice controls may affect both our revenues and net income.\nThe laws of the PRC provide the government broad power to fix and adjust prices. Although coal and coke are not presently subject to direct price controls by the PRC government, we cannot give any assurance that these products will not be made subject to such controls in the future. To the extent that these products are subject to price controls, our revenue, gross profit, gross margin and net income may be adversely affected since the revenue we derive may become limited and we may face no limitation on our costs. In such a scenario, we may not be able to pass on any increases in costs to our customers. Further, if price controls affect both the revenue and the costs, our ability to operate profitably and the extent of the profitability will be effectively subject to determination by the applicable PRC regulatory authorities.\nSince our officers and directors reside outside of the United States, it may be difficult for you to enforce your rights against them or enforce United States court judgments against them in the PRC.\nOur directors and executive officers reside in the PRC and all of our assets are located in the PRC. It may therefore be difficult or impossible for United States investors to enforce their legal rights, to effect service of process upon our directors or officers or to enforce judgments of United States courts predicated upon civil liabilities and criminal penalties of our directors and officers under federal securities laws. Further, there are no extradition treaties now in effect between the United States and the PRC, which may limit the effective enforcement against us or our officers and directors of criminal penalties under the U.S. federal securities law or otherwise.\nSince our funds are held in banks which do not provide insurance, the failure of any bank in which we deposit our funds could affect our ability to continue in business.\nBanks and other financial institutions in the PRC do not provide insurance for funds held on deposit. As a result, in the event of a bank failure, we may not have access to funds we deposit in PRC banks. Depending upon the amount of money we maintain in a PRC bank that fails, our inability to have access to cash could impair operations, and, if we are not able to access funds to pay our suppliers, employees and other creditors, we may be unable to continue in business.\nFailure to comply with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.\nWe are subject to the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which generally prohibits United States companies from engaging in bribery or other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Foreign companies, including some that may compete with us, are not subject to these prohibitions. Corruption, extortion, bribery, pay-offs, theft and other fraudulent practices occur from time-to-time in the PRC. We can make no assurance, however, that our employees or other agents will not engage in such conduct for which CETC might be held responsible. If our employees or other agents are found to have engaged in such practices, CETC could suffer severe penalties and other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be restricted from freely converting the RMB to other currencies in a timely manner.\nThe RMB is not a freely convertible currency at present. We receive all of our revenue in RMB, which may need to be converted to other currencies, primarily U.S. dollars, in order to be remitted outside of the PRC. Effective July 1, 1996, foreign currency \u201ccurrent account\u201d transactions by foreign investment enterprises, including Sino-foreign joint-ventures, are no longer subject to the approval of SAFE, but need only a ministerial review, according to the Administration of the Settlement, Sale and Payment of Foreign Exchange Provisions promulgated in 1996 (the \u201cFX regulations\u201d). \u201cCurrent account\u201d items include international commercial transactions, which occur on a regular basis, such as those relating to trade and provision of services. Distributions to joint-venture parties also are considered \u201ccurrent account transactions.\u201d Other non-current account items, known as \u201ccapital account\u201d items, remain subject to SAFE approval. Under current regulations, we can obtain foreign currency in exchange for RMB from swap centers authorized by the government. We do not anticipate problems in obtaining foreign currency to satisfy our requirements; however, there is no assurance that foreign currency shortages or changes in currency exchange laws and regulations by the PRC government will not restrict us from freely converting RMB in a timely manner.\nOn March 30, 2015, the SAFE issued the Circular on Reform of the Administrative Rules of the Payment and Settlement of Foreign Exchange Capital of Foreign-Invested Enterprises, or SAFE Circular 19, which became effective on June 1, 2015. Pursuant to SAFE Circular 19, foreign-invested enterprises may either continue to follow the current payment-based foreign currency settlement system or elect to follow the \u2018\u2018conversion-at-will\u2019\u2019 regime of foreign currency settlement. Where a foreign-invested enterprise follows the conversion-at-will regime of foreign currency settlement, it may convert part or all of the amount of the foreign currency in its capital account into Renminbi at any time. The converted Renminbi will be kept in a designated account labeled as settled but pending payment, and if the foreign-invested enterprise needs to make payment from such designated account, it still needs to go through the review process with its bank and provide necessary supporting documents. According to SAFE Circular 19, such Renminbi capital may be used at the discretion of the foreign-invested enterprise and the SAFE will eliminate the prior approval requirement and only examine the authenticity of the declared usage afterwards. In addition, as Circular 19 was promulgated recently, there remain substantial uncertainties with respect to the interpretation and implementation of this circular by relevant authorities. In light of the various requirements imposed by PRC regulations foreign currency, we cannot assure you that we will be able to complete the necessary government registrations or obtain the necessary government approvals on a timely basis, if at all, with respect to the usage of RMB converted from other currency.\nFluctuations in the exchange rate could have an adverse effect upon our business and reported financial results.\nWe conduct our business in RMB, thus our functional currency is the RMB, while our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. The value of the RMB against the U.S. dollar and other currencies may fluctuate and is affected by, among other things, the political situation as well as economic policies and conditions. On July 21, 2005, the PRC government changed its decade old policy of pegging its currency to the U.S. currency. Under the current policy, the RMB is permitted to fluctuate within a narrow and managed band against a basket of certain foreign currencies. This change in policy has resulted in an approximate 20% appreciation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar between July 21, 2005 and June 30, 2015. However, there remains significant international pressure on the PRC government to adopt an even more flexible currency policy, which could result in a further and more significant appreciation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar. To the extent any of our future revenues are denominated in currencies other than the United States dollar, we would be subject to increased risks relating to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results since operating results are reported in United States dollars and significant changes in the exchange rate could materially impact our reported earnings.\nOur PRC subsidiary and controlled entities are subject to restrictions on making payments to us, which could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to pay dividends on our capital stock.\nWe are a holding company incorporated in the State of Florida and do not have any assets or conduct any business operations other than our investment in the VIEs that we control in China. As a result of our holding company structure, we rely entirely on contractual payments from the VIEs and dividends from our PRC subsidiary for our cash needs, including the funds necessary to pay any dividends and other cash distributions to our shareholders, to service any debt we may incur and to pay our operating expenses. The payment of dividends by entities established in China is subject to limitations. Regulations in China currently permit payment of dividends only out of accumulated profits as determined in accordance with accounting standards and regulations in China. Each of our PRC subsidiary and VIEs is required to set aside at least 10% of its after-tax profit based on PRC accounting standards each year to its general reserves or statutory capital reserve fund until the aggregate amount of such reserves reaches 50% of its respective registered capital. As a result, they are restricted in their ability to transfer a portion of their net assets to us in the form of dividends, loans or advances. We anticipate that in the foreseeable future our PRC subsidiary and VIEs will need to continue to set aside 10% of their respective after-tax profits to their statutory reserves. Further, our PRC subsidiary and VIEs may incur debt on their own in the future, and the instruments governing such debt may restrict their ability to make contractual or dividend payments to us. If we are unable to receive all of the funds we require for our operations through contractual or dividend arrangements with our PRC subsidiary and VIEs, we may not have sufficient cash flow to fund our corporate overhead and regulatory obligations in the United States and may be unable to pay dividends on our shares of capital stock.\nRisks Related to an Investment in Our Securities\nThe rights of the holders of common stock may be impaired by the potential issuance of dilutive securities, namely convertible debt, and additional common stock.\nOur board of directors has the right, without shareholder approval, to issue other dilutive securities with voting, dividend, conversion, liquidation or other rights which could adversely affect the voting power and equity interest of the holders of our common stock. These additional securities could be issued with the right to more than one vote per share, and/or could be utilized as a method of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change of control. The possible impact on takeover attempts could adversely affect the price of the common stock. Although we have no present intention to issue any additional dilutive securities for financing purposes, we may issue such shares in the future.\nUnder our charter and relevant corporate and securities law, the board of directors may approve the issuance of common stock in connection with certain types of transactions such as of acquisitions of other companies or mining assets, without obtaining shareholder approval. As a result, additional securities may be issued in the event of such transactions, resulting in dilution of the holdings of all pre-transaction shareholders, even though one or more of our shareholders may disagree with our decision to acquire a target or assets.\nThe market price for our common stock may be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations, which may adversely affect the price at which you can sell our shares.\nThe market price for our common stock may be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors including the following:\n\u00b7 actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operations results;\n\u00b7 changes in financial estimates or projections developed by us or securities research analysts;\n\u00b7 conditions in foreign or domestic coal or coke markets;\n\u00b7 changes in the economic performance or market valuations of other meat processing companies;\n\u00b7 announcements by us or our competitors of new products, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint-ventures or capital commitments;\n\u00b7 addition or departure of key personnel;\n\u00b7 fluctuations of exchange rates between the RMB and the U.S. dollar;\n\u00b7 intellectual property litigation; and\n\u00b7 general economic or political conditions in China.\nIn addition, the securities market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are not related to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our stock.\nOur common stock has a limited public float. As a result, in the near future and beyond, liquidity in our shares may be limited, and you may be unable to sell at or near the purchased price or at all if you need to sell your shares or otherwise liquidate your holdings.\nWe cannot predict the extent to which an active public market for our common stock will be sustained. Our common stock became listed on NASDAQ in February 2010 and has a limited public float. As a result, we are relatively unknown to stock analysts, stock brokers, institutional investors and others in the investment community that generate or influence sales volume. As a consequence, there have been and may be periods of several days or more when trading activity in the shares is or will be minimal or non-existent, as compared to a seasoned issuer that has a large and steady volume of trading activity that will generally support continuous sales without an adverse effect on share price. We cannot provide any assurance that a broader or more active public trading market for our common stock will develop or be sustained in the future, or that any particular level of trading volume in our stock will be sustained.\nThe market for our common stock is expected to be characterized by significant price volatility when compared to seasoned issuers, and we anticipate that our share price will continue to be more volatile than a seasoned issuer for some time. The price at which you purchase our common stock may not be indicative of the price that will prevail in the trading market. You may be unable to sell your common stock at or above your purchase price if at all, which may result in substantial losses to you. Volatility in share prices is attributable to a number of factors. In the near future, our common stock is expected to be sporadically and/or thinly traded. As a consequence of this lack of liquidity, the trading of relatively small quantities of shares by our shareholders may disproportionately influence the price of those shares in either direction. The price for our shares could, for example, decline precipitously in the event a large number of our common shares are sold on the market without commensurate demand, as compared to a seasoned issuer which could better absorb those sales without adverse impact on our share price. The following factors also may add to the volatility in the price of our common stock: actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly or annual operating results; adverse outcomes; additions to or departures of key personnel, as well as other items discussed under this Risk Factor section, as well as elsewhere in our reports, filings and public disclosures. Many of these factors are beyond our control and may decrease the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. We cannot make any predictions or projections as to what the prevailing market price for our common stock will be at any time, including as to whether our common stock will sustain any particular trading price, or as to what effect the sale of shares or the availability of common shares for sale at any time will have on the then prevailing market price.\nVolatility in our common stock price may subject us to securities litigation.\nThe future market for our common stock may be characterized by significant price volatility when compared to seasoned issuers, and we expect our share price will be more volatile than a seasoned issuer for the indefinite future. There are periods during which the trading volume of our stock is relatively low, which may exacerbate volatility and result in exaggerated price changes in the common stock. In the past, plaintiffs have often initiated securities class action litigation against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of our securities. We may, in the future, be the target of similar litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and liabilities and could divert management\u2019s attention and resources.\nTechniques employed by manipulative short sellers in Chinese small cap stocks may drive down the market price of our common stock.\nShort selling is the practice of selling securities that the seller does not own but rather has, supposedly, borrowed from a third party with the intention of buying identical securities back at a later date to return to the lender. The short seller hopes to profit from a decline in the value of the securities between the sale of the borrowed securities and the purchase of the replacement shares, as the short seller expects to pay less in that purchase than it received in the sale. As it is therefore in the short seller\u2019s best interests for the price of the stock to decline, many short sellers (sometime known as \u201cdisclosed shorts\u201d) publish, or arrange for the publication of, negative opinions regarding the relevant issuer and its business prospects in order to create negative market momentum and generate profits for themselves after selling a stock short. While traditionally these disclosed shorts were limited in their ability to access mainstream business media or to otherwise create negative market rumors, the rise of the Internet and technological advancements regarding document creation, videotaping and publication by weblog (\u201cblogging\u201d) have allowed many disclosed shorts to publicly attack a company\u2019s credibility, strategy and veracity by means of so-called research reports that mimic the type of investment analysis performed by large Wall Street firm and independent research analysts. These short attacks have, in the past, led to selling of shares in the market, on occasion in large scale and broad base. Issuers with business operations based in the PRC and who have limited trading volumes and are susceptible to higher volatility levels than U.S. domestic large-cap stocks, can be particularly vulnerable to such short attacks.\nThese short seller publications are not regulated by any governmental, self-regulatory organization or other official authority in the U.S., are not subject to the certification requirements imposed by the SEC in Regulation Analyst Certification and, accordingly, the opinions they express may be based on distortions of actual facts or, in some cases, fabrications of facts. In light of the limited risks involved in publishing such information, and the enormous profit that can be made from running just one successful short attack, unless the short sellers become subject to significant penalties, it is more likely than not that disclosed shorts will continue to issue such reports.\nWhile we intend to strongly defend our public filings against any such short seller attacks, oftentimes we are constrained, either by principles of freedom of speech, applicable state law (often called \u201cAnti-SLAPP statutes\u201d), or issues of commercial confidentiality, in the manner in which we can proceed against the relevant short seller. You should be aware that in light of the relative freedom to operate that such persons enjoy - oftentimes blogging from outside the U.S. with little or no assets or identity requirements - should we be targeted for such an attack, our stock will likely suffer from a temporary, or possibly long term, decline in market price should the rumors created not be dismissed by market participants.\nWe have incurred and will continue to incur increased costs as a public company which may affect our profitability.\nAs a public company, we have incurred and will continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses. We are subject to the SEC\u2019s rules and regulations relating to public disclosure. SEC disclosures generally involve a substantial expenditure of financial resources. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as new rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and NASDAQ, has required changes in corporate governance practices of public companies. For example, we are required to maintain independent board committees and adopt policies regarding internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures. Such practices have significantly increased our legal and financial compliance costs and made some activities more time-consuming and costly. Management may also need to increase compensation for senior executive officers, engage senior financial officers able to adopt financial reporting and control procedures, allocate a budget for an investor and public relations program, and increase our financial and accounting staff in order to meet the demands and financial reporting requirements as a public reporting company. Such additional personnel, public relations, reporting and compliance costs will affect our financial results.\nFailure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results and shareholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting.\nInternal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our operating results could be harmed. Failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a material adverse effect on our stock price. Although we are not required to have an auditor\u2019s report on internal controls over financial reporting under current SEC regulations, our management is required to and has assessed our internal control implementation and concluded that our internal controls were ineffective for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015.\nGenerally, we have not paid any cash dividends to our shareholders and no cash dividends will be paid in the foreseeable future.\nWe do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future and it may not have sufficient funds legally available to pay dividends. Even if the funds are legally available for distribution, we may nevertheless decide or may be unable to pay any dividends. We intend to retain all earnings for our operations.\nActivities prior to the Share Exchange relating to our prior business then known as \u201cAbleauctions.com, Inc.\u201d may lead to future liability.\nPrior to our acquisition of Top Favour on February 5, 2010, we were known as \u201cAbleauctions.com, Inc.,\u201d and engaged in businesses unrelated to our current operations. Although certain previously controlling shareholders of Ableauctions.com and its related liquidating trust have provided certain indemnifications against any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense arising out of or based on any breach of or inaccuracy in any of their representations, warranties and covenants made regarding such acquisition, including a $1 million reserve fund set aside by a liquidating trust for purposes of paying any indemnification claims by us, any liabilities relating to such prior business against which we are not completely indemnified may have a material adverse effect on us (and indirectly our shareholders) may not be able to benefit from any funds in reserve.\nReverse merger transactions of the type conducted between us and Top Favour are often heavily scrutinized by the SEC and we may encounter difficulties or delays in obtaining future regulatory approvals.\nHistorically, the SEC has not generally favored transactions in which a privately-held company merges into a public reporting company with listed securities. The SEC or other regulatory authorities may unexpectedly assert a different interpretation of existing rules than the interpretation we or our advisors relied upon, used and/or considered reasonable, which could increase the cost of, or adversely affect our ability to, file and achieve effectiveness for our registration statements, or interfere with or negate the ability of our shareholders to rely upon Rule 144 or similar rules.\nFuture sales of our common stock may decrease the price for such shares.\nActual sales, or the prospect of sales by our shareholders, may have a negative effect on the market price of the shares of our common stock. We may also register certain shares of our common stock that are subject to outstanding convertible securities, if any, or reserved for issuance under our stock option plans. Once such shares are registered, they can be freely sold in the public market upon exercise of the options. At any given time, if any of our shareholders either individually or in the aggregate cause a large number of securities to be sold in the public market, or if the market perceives that these holders intend to sell a large number of securities, such sales or anticipated sales could result in a substantial reduction in the trading price of shares of our common stock and could also impede our ability to raise future capital.\nThe elimination of monetary liability against our directors, officers and employees under state law and the existence of indemnification rights to our directors, officers and employees may result in substantial expenditures by us and may discourage lawsuits against our directors, officers and employees.\nOur articles of incorporation contain specific provisions that eliminate or limit the liability of directors for monetary damages to us and our shareholders, and we are prepared to give such indemnification to our directors and officers to the extent permissible under state law. We may also maintain or enter into, from time to time, agreements that obligate us to indemnify our officers and directors. Such indemnification obligations could result in our incurring substantial expenditures to cover the cost of settlement or damage awards against any such officer or director, which we may be unable to recoup. These provisions and resultant costs may also discourage us from bringing a lawsuit against our officers and directors for breaches of their fiduciary duties, and may similarly discourage the filing of derivative litigation by our shareholders against our officers and directors even though such actions, if successful, might otherwise benefit us and our shareholders.\nWe will need additional capital, and the sale of additional shares or other equity securities could result in additional dilution to our shareholders.\nWe will require additional cash resources to meet our ongoing obligations. If our resources are insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements, we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain additional credit, although we have no firm commitments to do so. The sale of additional equity securities could result in additional dilution to our shareholders. Incurring indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could result in operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations. We cannot assure you that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to it, if at all.\nThe registration and potential sale, either pursuant to our prospectus or pursuant to Rule 144, by certain selling security holders of a significant number of shares could encourage short sales by third parties.\nThere may be significant downward pressure on our stock price caused by the sale or potential sale of a significant number of shares by certain of selling security holders pursuant to our effective registration statement on Form S-1 and prospectus or under Rule 144, which could allow short sellers of our stock an opportunity to take advantage of any decrease in the value of our stock. The presence of short sellers in our common stock may further depress the price of our common stock. If the selling security holders sell a significant number of shares of common stock, the market price of our common stock may decline. Furthermore, the sale or potential sale of the offered securities pursuant to the prospectus and the depressive effect of such sales or potential sales could make it difficult for us to raise funds from other sources.\nWe failed to meet the requirement of NASDAQ to maintain a minimum bid price of $1 per share for the last 30 consecutive business days. If we do not regain compliance in the next 180 calendar days, we need to apply for an additional compliance period. However, there is no guarantee that we will be eligible to apply for the additional compliance period or we will be able to cure the deficiency in the additional compliance period. If so, we may be subject to delisting by NASDAQ.\nOn September 29, 2015, we received a letter from The NASDAQ Stock Exchange regarding our failure to comply with NASDAQ Continued Listing Rule (the \u201cRule\u201d) 5550(a)(2), which requires that listed securities maintain a minimum bid price of $1 per share. Based upon the closing bid price for the last 30 consecutive business days (including, in particular, the period August 17, 2015 through September 28, 2015), we failed to meet the aforesaid requirement. Under Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we will be provided a compliance period of 180 calendar days, from September 29, 2015 to March 28, 2016, to regain compliance. If at any time during this 180 day period the closing bid price of our security is at least $1 for a minimum of ten consecutive business days, our compliance will be regained. In the event we do not regain compliance in the first compliance period, we may be eligible to apply for an additional 180 calendar days to regain compliance subject to certain NASDAQ Rules and under the discretion of the NASDAQ Staff. However, if we are determined to be neither eligible to apply for curing the deficiency nor able to cure the deficiency at such time, we may be subject to delisting by NASDAQ.", "PERMNO": 88278, "SIC": 1220, "TIC": "HGLI"}
