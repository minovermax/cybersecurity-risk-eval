RISK FACTORS\nInvestors should consider carefully the following risk factors that could cause our business, operating results and financial condition to be materially adversely affected. New risks may emerge at any time, and we cannot predict those risks or estimate the extent to which they may affect our business or financial performance. These risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other detailed information concerning IPALCO and IPL set forth in the Notes to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements in \u201cItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d and in \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d herein. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face.\nOur electric generating facilities are subject to operational risks that could result in unscheduled plant outages, unanticipated operation and/or maintenance expenses, increased fuel or purchased power costs and other significant liabilities for which we may not have adequate insurance coverage.\nWe operate coal, oil and natural gas generating facilities, which involve certain risks that can adversely affect energy costs, output and efficiency levels. These risks include:\n\u2022\nincreased prices for fuel and fuel transportation as existing contracts expire or as such contracts are adjusted through price re-opener provisions or automatic adjustments;\n\u2022\nunit or facility shutdowns due to a breakdown or failure of equipment or processes;\n\u2022\ndisruptions in the availability or delivery of fuel and lack of adequate inventories;\n\u2022\nshortages of or delays in obtaining equipment;\n\u2022\nloss of cost-effective disposal options for solid waste generated by the facilities;\n\u2022\nlabor disputes or work stoppages by employees;\n\u2022\naccidents and injuries;\n\u2022\nreliability of our suppliers;\n\u2022\ninability to comply with regulatory or permit requirements;\n\u2022\noperational restrictions resulting from environmental or permit limitations or governmental interventions;\n\u2022\nconstruction delays and cost overruns;\n\u2022\ndisruptions in the delivery of electricity;\n\u2022\nthe availability of qualified personnel;\n\u2022\nevents occurring on third party systems that interconnect to and affect our system;\n\u2022\noperator error; and\n\u2022\ncatastrophic events such as fires, explosions, cyber-attacks, terrorist acts, sabotage, acts of war, pandemic events, or natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes (including seismic activity from the Wabash Valley seismic zone, an area of significant seismic activity in the central U.S.), tornadoes, severe winds, ice or snow storms, droughts, or other similar occurrences affecting our generating facilities, as well as our transmission and distribution systems.\nThe above risks could result in unscheduled plant outages, unanticipated operation and/or maintenance expenses, increased capital expenditures, and/or increased fuel and purchased power costs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. If unexpected plant outages occur frequently and/or for extended periods of time, this could result in adverse regulatory action and/or reduced wholesale revenues.\nAdditionally, as a result of the above risks and other potential hazards associated with the power generation industry, we may from time to time become exposed to significant liabilities for which we may not have adequate insurance coverage. Power generation involves hazardous activities, including acquiring, transporting and unloading fuel, operating large pieces of rotating equipment and delivering electricity to transmission and distribution systems. The control and management of these risks depend upon adequate development and training of personnel and on the existence of operational procedures, preventative maintenance plans and specific programs supported by quality control systems which reduce, but do not eliminate, the possibility of the occurrence and impact of these risks.\nThe hazardous activities described above can also cause significant personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property, plant and equipment, contamination of, or damage to, the environment and suspension of operations. The occurrence of any one of these events may result in our being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting claims for substantial damages, environmental cleanup costs, personal injury and fines and/or penalties. We maintain an amount of insurance protection that we believe is adequate, but there can be no assurance that our insurance will be sufficient or effective under all circumstances and against all hazards or liabilities to which we may be subject. A successful claim for which we are not fully insured could hurt our financial results and materially harm our financial condition. In addition, except for IPL\u2019s large substations, transmission and distribution assets are not covered by insurance and are considered to be outside the scope of\nproperty insurance. Further, due to rising insurance costs and changes in the insurance markets, we cannot provide assurance that insurance coverage will continue to be available on terms similar to those presently available to us or at all. Any such losses not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, operation of our generating stations below expected capacity levels, or unplanned outages at these stations, could cause reduced energy output and efficiency levels, which would likely result in decreased revenues and/or increased expenses that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe may not always be able to recover our costs to deliver electricity to our retail customers. The costs we can recover and the return on capital we are permitted to earn for certain aspects of our business are regulated and governed by the laws of Indiana and the rules, policies and procedures of the IURC.\nWe are currently obligated to supply electric energy to retail customers in our service territory. Even though rate regulation is premised on full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital, there can be no assurance that the IURC will agree that all of our costs have been prudently incurred or are recoverable. There also is no assurance that the regulatory process in which rates are determined will always result in rates that will produce a full or timely recovery of our costs and authorized return. From time to time, the demand for electric energy required to meet our service obligations could exceed our available electric generating capacity. When our retail customer demand exceeds our generating capacity for units operating under MISO economic dispatch, recovery of our cost to purchase electric energy in the MISO market to meet that demand is subject to a stipulation and settlement agreement. The agreement includes a benchmark which compares hourly purchased power costs to daily natural gas prices. Purchased power costs above the benchmark must meet certain criteria in order for us to fully recover them from our retail customers, such as consideration of the capacity of units available but not selected by the MISO economic dispatch. We may not always have the ability to pass all of the purchased power costs on to our customers, and even if we are able to do so, there may be a significant delay between the time the costs are incurred and the time the costs are recovered. Since these situations most often occur during periods of peak demand, the market price for electric energy at the time we purchase it could be very high, and we may not be allowed to recover all of such costs through our FAC. Even if a supply shortage were brief, we could suffer substantial losses that could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Please see \u201cItem 1. Business - Regulatory Matters - FAC and Authorized Annual Jurisdictional Net Operating Income\u201d for additional details regarding the benchmark and the process to recover fuel costs.\nChanges in, or reinterpretations of, the laws, rules, policies and procedures that set electric rates, permitted rates of return, changes in IPL\u2019s rate structure, regulations regarding ownership of generation assets and electric service, reliability initiatives, fuel and purchased power (which account for a substantial portion of our operating costs), capital expenditures and investments and the recovery of these and other costs on a full or timely basis through rates, power market prices and changes to the frequency and timing of rate increases could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe availability and cost of fuel and other commodities has experienced and could continue to experience significant volatility and we may not be able to hedge the entire exposure of our operations from availability and price volatility. In addition, a significant amount of our electricity is generated by coal and a majority of our supply of coal comes from one supplier.\nOur business is sensitive to changes in the price of coal, natural gas, purchased power and emissions allowances. In addition, changes in the prices of steel, copper and other raw materials can have a significant impact on our costs. We also are dependent on purchased power, in part, to meet our seasonal planning reserve margins. Any changes in fuel prices could affect the prices we charge, our operating costs and our competitive position with respect to our products and services.\nOur exposure to fluctuations in the price of fuel is limited because pursuant to Indiana law, we may apply to the IURC for a change in our FAC every three months to recover our estimated fuel costs, which may be above or below the levels included in our basic rates. In addition, we may generally recover the energy portion of our purchased power costs in these quarterly FAC proceedings subject to a benchmark (as discussed in \u201cItem 1. Business - Regulatory Matters\u201d). As part of this cost-recovery process, we must present evidence in each proceeding that we have made every reasonable effort to acquire fuel and generate or purchase power or both so as to provide electricity to our retail customers at the lowest fuel cost reasonably possible. If in the future we are unable to timely or fully recover our fuel and purchased power costs, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nApproximately 97% of the energy we produced in 2015 was generated by coal as compared to approximately 99% in both 2014 and 2013. While we have approximately 85% in total of our current coal requirements for the three-year period ending December 31, 2018 under long-term contracts, the balance is yet to be purchased and will be purchased under a combination of long-term contracts, short-term contracts and on the spot market. Prices can be highly volatile in both the short-term market and on the spot market. The coal market has experienced significant price volatility in the last several years. We are now in a global market for coal in which our domestic price is increasingly affected by international supply disruptions and demand balance. Coal exports from the U.S. have increased significantly at times in recent years. In addition, domestic developments such as government-imposed direct costs and permitting issues that affect mining costs and supply availability, and the variable demand of retail customer load and the performance of our generation fleet have an impact on our fuel procurement operations. In addition, pricing provisions in some of our coal contracts with terms of one year or more allow for price changes under certain circumstances.\nBecause of our substantial dependence on coal to meet customer demand for electricity, our business and operations could be materially adversely affected by unexpected price volatility in the coal market, price increases pursuant to the provisions of certain of our long-term coal contracts, and the continued regulatory and political scrutiny of coal. As discussed below, regulators, politicians and non-governmental organizations have expressed concern about GHG emissions and are taking actions which, in addition to the potential physical risk associated with climate change, could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Our dependence on coal also means that the output of our coal-fired generation units can be greatly affected by the costs of other fuels combusted by generation facilities that compete with our coal-fired generation units. Natural gas prices over the last several years have been relatively low and some gas-fired generators that previously were primarily used during periods of peak and intermediate electric demand are now running even during periods of relatively low demand. This has caused many coal-fired generators, including ours, to run fewer hours during these periods of base-load demand.\nIn addition, substantially all of our coal supply is currently mined in the state of Indiana, and all of our coal supply is mined by unaffiliated suppliers or third parties. Our goal is to carry a 25-50 day system supply of coal to offset unforeseen occurrences such as equipment breakdowns and transportation or mine delays. Moreover, a majority of our existing coal under contract for the three-year period ending December 31, 2018 comes from a single supplier. In recent years, the coal industry has undergone significant restructuring as a result of debt restructurings, bankruptcy proceedings and other factors. Further restructuring may result in a failure of our suppliers to fulfill their contractual obligations or fewer suppliers and, consequently, increased dependency on any one supplier. Any significant disruption in the ability of our suppliers, particularly our most significant suppliers, to mine or deliver coal or other fuel, or any failure on the part of our suppliers to fulfill their contractual obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business. In the event of disruptions or failures, there can be no assurance that we would be able to purchase power or find another supplier of fuel on similarly favorable terms, which could also limit our ability to recover fuel costs through the FAC proceedings.\nRegulators, politicians and non-governmental organizations have expressed concern about GHG emissions and are taking actions which, in addition to the potential physical risks associated with climate change, could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOne byproduct of burning coal and other fossil fuels is the emission of GHGs, including CO2. At the federal, state and regional levels, policies are under development or have been developed to regulate GHG emissions, including by effectively putting a cost on such emissions to create financial incentives to reduce them. In 2015, IPL emitted approximately 14 million tons of CO2 from our power plants. IPL uses CO2 emission estimation methodologies supported by \u201cThe Greenhouse Gas Protocol\u201d reporting standard on GHG emissions. Our CO2 emissions are calculated from actual fuel heat inputs and fuel type CO2 emission factors.\nAny existing or future international, federal, state or regional legislation or regulation of GHG emissions could have a material adverse impact on our financial performance. The actual impact on our financial performance will depend on a number of factors, including among others, the degree and timing of GHG emissions reductions required under any such legislation or regulations, the price and availability of offsets, the extent to which market-based compliance options are available, the extent to which we would be entitled to receive GHG emissions allowances without having to purchase them in an auction or on the open market and the impact of such legislation or regulation on our ability to recover costs incurred through rate increases or otherwise. As a result of these factors, our cost of compliance could be substantial and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Such legislation and regulations could also impair the value of our generation stations or make some of these stations uneconomical to maintain or operate and could raise uncertainty about the future viability of fossil fuels, particularly coal, as an energy source for new and existing generation stations. Although we may seek recovery of costs associated with new climate change or GHG regulations, our inability to fully or timely recover such costs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Additionally,\nconcerns over GHG emissions and their effect on the environment could lead to reduced demand for coal-fired power, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nFurthermore, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, physical risks from climate change could include, but are not limited to, increased runoff and earlier spring peak discharge in many glacier and snow-fed rivers, warming of lakes and rivers, an increase in sea level, changes and variability in precipitation and in the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events. Physical impacts may have the potential to significantly affect our business and operations. For example, extreme weather events could result in increased downtime and operation and maintenance costs at our electric power generation facilities and our support facilities. Variations in weather conditions, primarily temperature and humidity, would also be expected to affect the energy needs of customers. A decrease in energy consumption could decrease our revenues. In addition, while revenues would be expected to increase if the energy consumption of customers increased, such increase could prompt the need for additional investment in generation capacity. Changes in the temperature of lakes and rivers and changes in precipitation that result in drought could adversely affect the operations of our fossil-fuel fired electric power generation facilities. If any of the foregoing risks materialize, costs may increase or revenues may decrease and there could be a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIn addition to the rules already in effect, regulatory initiatives regarding GHG emissions may be implemented in the future, although at this time we cannot predict if, how, or to what extent such initiatives would affect us. Generally, we believe costs to comply with any regulations implemented to reduce GHG emissions, including those already promulgated, would be deemed as part of the costs of providing electricity to our customers and as such, we would seek recovery for such costs in our rates. However, no assurance can be given as to whether the IURC will approve such requests. Finally, concerns over GHG emissions and their effect on the environment could lead to reduced demand for coal-fired power, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Please see \u201cItem 1. Business - Environmental Matters\u201d for a more comprehensive discussion of environmental matters impacting us, including those relating to regulation of GHG emissions.\nWe are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations that require capital expenditures, increase our cost of operations, may expose us to environmental liabilities or make continued operation of certain generating units unprofitable.\nWe are subject to various federal, state, regional and local environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations governing, among other things, the generation, storage, handling, use, disposal and transportation of regulated materials, including ash; the use and discharge of water used in generation boilers and for cooling purposes; the emission and discharge of hazardous and other materials into the environment; and the health and safety of our employees. We could also become subject to additional environmental laws and regulations and other requirements in the future. These laws and regulations often require a lengthy and complex process of obtaining and renewing permits and other governmental authorizations from federal, state and local agencies. A violation of these laws, regulations or permits can result in substantial fines, other sanctions, permit revocation and/or facility shutdowns. In addition, any alleged violation of these laws, regulations and other requirements may require us to expend significant resources to defend against any such alleged violations. Compliance with these laws, regulations and other requirements requires us to expend significant funds and resources and could at some point become prohibitively expensive or result in our shutting down (temporarily or permanently) or altering the operation of our facilities. Environmental laws and regulations also generally require us to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses, permits, inspections and other approvals. If we are not able to timely obtain, maintain or comply with all licenses, permits, inspections and approvals required to operate our business, then our operations could be prevented, delayed or subject to additional costs. Failure to comply with environmental laws, regulations and other requirements may result in the imposition of fines and penalties or other sanctions and the imposition of stricter environmental standards and controls and other injunctive measures affecting operating assets. Under certain environmental laws, we could also be held responsible for costs relating to contamination at our past or present facilities and at third-party waste disposal sites. We could also be held liable for human exposure to such hazardous substances or for other environmental damage. From time to time we are subject to enforcement and litigation actions for claims of noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations. We cannot assure that we will be successful in defending against any claim of noncompliance. Any alleged violation of these laws, regulations and other requirements may require us to expend significant resources to defend against any such alleged violations. Our costs and liabilities relating to environmental matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe amount of capital expenditures required to comply with environmental laws or regulations could be impacted by the outcome of the EPA\u2019s NOVs described in \u201cItem 1. Business - Environmental Matters - New Source Review and Other CAA NOVs.\u201d These NOVs could also result in fines, which could be material. In addition to the five oil-fired peaking units that were retired in the second quarter of 2013, the combination of existing and expected environmental regulations has resulted in us\nretiring or refueling several other generating units by 2017, as described in \u201cItem 1. Business - Environmental Matters - Unit Retirements and Replacement Generation.\u201d Our units are primarily coal-fired and the units that are currently being retired and/or converted are not equipped with the advanced environmental control technologies needed to comply with existing and expected regulations.\nPlease see \u201cItem 1. Business - Environmental Matters\u201d for a more comprehensive discussion of environmental matters impacting us.\nThe use of non-derivative and derivative instruments in the normal course of business could result in losses that could negatively impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nWe sometimes use non-derivative and derivative instruments, such as swaps, options, futures and forwards, to manage commodity and financial risks. We may at times enter into forward contracts to hedge the risk of volatility in earnings from wholesale marketing activities. These trades are affected by a range of factors, including variations in power demand, fluctuations in market prices, market prices for alternative commodities and optimization opportunities. We have attempted to manage our commodities price risk exposure by establishing and enforcing risk limits and risk management policies. Despite our efforts, however, these risk limits and management policies may not work as planned and fluctuating prices and other events could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources, the valuation of these instruments can involve management\u2019s judgment or the use of estimates. As a result, changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of some of these contracts. We could also recognize financial losses as a result of volatility in the market values of these contracts, a counterparty failing to perform, or the underlying transactions which the instruments are intended to hedge failing to materialize, which could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Although we have not used any derivative instruments recently, we may do so in the future, and their use could result in losses that could negatively impact us.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act contains significant requirements related to derivatives that, among other things, could reduce the cost effectiveness of entering into derivative transactions.\nIn July 2010, The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d) was signed into law. The Dodd-Frank Act contains significant requirements relating to derivatives, including, among others, a requirement that certain transactions be cleared on exchanges that would necessitate the posting of cash collateral for these transactions. We are considered an end-user under the Dodd-Frank Act and therefore are exempt from most of the collateral and margining requirements. We are required to report any bilateral derivative contracts, unless our counterparty is a major swap participant or has elected to report on our behalf. Even though we qualify for an exception from these requirements, our counterparties that do not qualify for the exception may pass along any increased costs incurred by them through higher prices and reductions in unsecured credit limits or be unable to enter into certain transactions with us. The occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur business is sensitive to weather and seasonal variations.\nWeather conditions significantly affect the demand for electric power, and accordingly, our business is affected by variations in general weather conditions and unusually severe weather. As a result of these factors, our operating revenues and associated operating expenses are not generated evenly by month during the year. We forecast electric sales on the basis of normal weather, which represents a long-term historical average. Significant variations from normal weather (such as warmer winters and cooler summers) could have a material impact on our revenue, operating income and net income and cash flows. In addition, severe or unusual weather, such as tornadoes and ice or snow storms, may cause outages and property damage that may require us to incur additional costs that may not be insured or recoverable from customers. While we are permitted to seek recovery of storm damage costs, if we are unable to fully recover such costs in a timely manner, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur membership in a regional transmission organization presents risks that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe are a member of MISO, a FERC-regulated regional transmission organization. MISO serves the electrical transmission needs of a 15-state area including much of the Mid-U.S. and Canada and maintains functional operational control over our electric transmission facilities as well as that of the other utility members of MISO. We retain control over our distribution facilities. As a result of membership in MISO and its operational control, our continued ability to import power, when necessary, and export power to the wholesale market has been, and may continue to be, impacted. We offer our generation and\nbid our load into this market on a day-ahead basis and settle differences in real time. Given the nature of MISO\u2019s policies regarding use of transmission facilities, and its administration of the energy and ancillary services markets, it is difficult to predict near-term operational impacts. We cannot assure MISO\u2019s reliable operation of the regional transmission system, or the impact of its operation of the energy and ancillary services markets.\nThe rules governing the various regional power markets may also change from time to time which could affect our costs and revenues and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We may be required to expand or otherwise change our transmission system according to decisions made by MISO rather than our internal planning process. In addition, various proposals and proceedings before the FERC relating to MISO or otherwise may cause transmission rates to change from time to time. We also incur fees and costs to participate in MISO.\nTo the extent that we rely, at least in part, on the performance of MISO to maintain the reliability of our transmission system, it puts us at some risk for the performance of MISO. In addition, actions taken by MISO to secure the reliable operation of the entire transmission system operated by MISO could result in voltage reductions, rolling blackouts, or sustained system-wide blackouts on IPL\u2019s transmission and distribution system, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. See also \u201cItem 1. Business - Regulatory Matters\u201d and \u201cItem 1. Business - MISO Operations.\u201d\nIf we were found not to be in compliance with the mandatory reliability standards, we could be subject to sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties, which likely would not be recoverable from customers through regulated rates.\nAs an owner and operator of a bulk power transmission system, IPL is subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by the NERC and enforced by the FERC. The standards are based on the functions that need to be performed to ensure the bulk power system operates reliably and is guided by reliability and market interface principles. Compliance with reliability standards may subject us to higher operating costs or increased capital expenditures. Although we expect to recover costs and expenditures from customers through regulated rates, there can be no assurance that the IURC will approve full recovery in a timely manner. If we were found not to be in compliance with the mandatory reliability standards, we could be subject to sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties, which likely would not be recoverable from customers through regulated rates and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe rely on access to the financial markets. General economic conditions and disruptions in the financial markets could adversely affect our ability to raise capital on favorable terms or at all, and cause increases in our interest expense.\nFrom time to time we rely on access to the capital and credit markets as a source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by operating cash flows. These capital and credit markets experience volatility and disruption from time to time and the ability of corporations to raise capital can be negatively impacted. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets make it harder and more expensive to raise capital. It is possible that our ability to raise capital on favorable terms or at all could be adversely affected by future market conditions, and we may be unable to access adequate funding to refinance our debt as it becomes due or finance capital expenditures. The extent of any impact will depend on several factors, including our operating cash flows, the overall supply and demand in the credit markets, our credit ratings, credit capacity, the cost of financing, and other general economic and business conditions. It may also depend on the performance of credit counterparties and financial institutions with which we do business. Access to funds under our existing financing arrangements is also dependent on the ability of our counterparties to meet their financing commitments. Our inability to obtain financing on reasonable terms, or at all, with creditworthy counterparties could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. If our available funding is limited or we are forced to fund our operations at a higher cost, these conditions may require us to curtail our business activities and increase our cost of funding, both of which could reduce our profitability.\nSee Note 7, \u201cDebt\u201d to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements of IPALCO in \u201cItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d included in this Form 10-K for information regarding indebtedness. See also \u201cItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk\u201d for information related to market risks.\nThe level of our indebtedness, and the security provided for this indebtedness, could adversely affect our financial flexibility.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had on a consolidated basis $2.3 billion of indebtedness and total common shareholder\u2019s equity of $352.9 million. IPL had $1,283.5 million of first mortgage bonds outstanding as of December 31, 2015, which are secured by the pledge of substantially all of the assets of IPL under the terms of IPL\u2019s mortgage and deed of trust. This level of indebtedness and related security could have important consequences, including the following:\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nrequiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund other corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; and\n\u2022\nlimiting, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness, our ability to borrow additional funds, as needed.\nWe expect to incur additional debt in the future, subject to the terms of our debt agreements and regulatory approvals for any IPL debt. To the extent we become more leveraged, the risks described above would increase. Further, actual cash requirements in the future may be greater than expected. Accordingly, our cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to repay at maturity all of the outstanding debt as it becomes due and, in that event, we may not be able to borrow money, sell assets or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms or at all to refinance our debt as it becomes due. For a further discussion of outstanding debt, see \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nWe have variable rate debt that bears interest based on a prevailing rate that is reset based on a market index that can be affected by market demand, supply, market interest rates and other market conditions. We also maintain both cash on deposit and investments in cash equivalents from time to time that could be impacted by interest rate fluctuations. As such, any event which impacts market interest rates could have a material effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, ratings agencies issue credit ratings on us and our debt that affect our borrowing costs under our financial arrangements and affect our potential pool of investors and funding sources. Our credit ratings also govern the collateral provisions of certain of our contracts. If the rating agencies were to downgrade our credit ratings, our borrowing costs would likely further increase, our potential pool of investors and funding resources could be reduced, and we could be required to post additional cash collateral under selected contracts. These events would likely reduce our liquidity and profitability and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur transmission and distribution system is subject to reliability and capacity risks.\nThe ongoing reliable performance of our transmission and distribution system is subject to risks due to, among other things, weather damage, intentional or unintentional damage, fires and/or explosions, plant outages, labor disputes, operator error, or inoperability of key infrastructure internal or external to us. The failure of our transmission and distribution system to fully deliver the energy demanded by customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, and if such failures occur frequently and/or for extended periods of time, could result in adverse regulatory action. In addition, the advent and quick adaptation of new products and services that require increased levels of electrical energy cannot be predicted and could result in insufficient transmission and distribution system capacity. As with all utilities, potential concern with the adequacy of transmission capacity on IPL\u2019s system or the regional systems operated by MISO could result in MISO, the NERC, the FERC or the IURC requiring us to upgrade or expand our transmission system through additional capital expenditures or share in the costs of regional expansion.\nCurrent and future conditions in the economy may adversely affect our customers, suppliers and other counterparties, which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows have been and will continue to be affected by general economic conditions. Slowing global economic growth, credit market conditions, fluctuating consumer and business confidence, fluctuating commodity prices, and other challenges currently affecting the general economy, have caused and may continue to cause some of our customers to experience deterioration of their businesses, cash flow shortages, and difficulty obtaining financing. As a result, existing customers may reduce their electricity consumption and may not be able to fulfill their payment obligations to us in the normal, timely fashion. In addition, some existing commercial and industrial customers may discontinue their operations. Sustained downturns, recessions or a sluggish economy generally affect the markets in which we operate and negatively influence our energy operations. A contracting, slow or sluggish economy could reduce the demand for energy in areas in which we are doing business. For example, during economic downturns, our commercial and industrial customers may see a decrease in demand for their products, which in turn may lead to a decrease in the amount of energy they require. Furthermore, projects which may result in potential new customers may be delayed until economic conditions improve. Our suppliers could also be affected by the economic downturn resulting in supply delays or unavailability. Reduced demand for our electric services, failure by our customers to timely remit full payment owed to us and supply delays or unavailability could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In particular, the projected economic growth and total employment in Indianapolis are important to the realization of our forecasts for annual energy sales.\nSome of our suppliers, customers and other counterparties, and others with whom we transact business may be experiencing financial difficulties, which may impact their ability to fulfill their obligations to us. For example, our counterparties on forward purchase contracts and financial institutions involved in our credit facility may become unable to fulfill their contractual obligations. We may not be able to enter into replacement agreements on terms as favorable as our existing agreements. If the general economic slowdown continues for significant periods or deteriorates significantly, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nWholesale power marketing activities may add volatility to earnings.\nWe engage in wholesale power marketing activities that primarily involve the offering of utility-owned or contracted generation into the MISO day-ahead and real-time markets. As part of these strategies, we may also execute energy contracts that are integrated with portfolio requirements around power supply and delivery. The earnings from wholesale marketing activities may vary based on fluctuating prices for electricity and the amount of electric generating capacity, beyond that needed to meet firm service requirements. In order to reduce the risk of volatility in earnings from wholesale marketing activities, we may at times enter into forward contracts to hedge such risk. If we do not accurately forecast future commodities prices or if our hedging procedures do not operate as planned we may experience losses. We did not use such hedges in 2015, 2014 or 2013.\nIn addition, the introduction of additional renewable energy, demand response or other energy supply into the MISO market could have the effect of reducing the demand for wholesale energy from other sources. This additional generation could have the impact of reducing market prices for energy and could reduce our opportunity to sell coal-fired and gas generation into the MISO market, thereby reducing our wholesale sales. Additionally, decreases in natural gas prices in the U.S. have the impact of reducing market prices for electricity, which can reduce our ability to sell excess generation on the wholesale market, as well as reduce our profit margin on wholesale sales.\nAs a result of the expected refueling of Harding Street Station Unit 7 (second quarter of 2016), the expected retirement of the coal-fired units at Eagle Valley (second quarter of 2016), and the April 2017 expected in-service date for the CCGT, we expect our ability to have excess generation available for sale on the wholesale market will be adversely impacted during 2016 through the first quarter of 2017.\nEconomic conditions relating to the asset performance and interest rates of the Pension Plans could materially and adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nPension costs are based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets, level of employer contributions, the expected life span of pension plan beneficiaries and the discount rate used to determine the present value of future pension obligations. Any of these assumptions could prove to be wrong, resulting in a shortfall of our Pension Plans\u2019 assets compared to pension obligations under the Pension Plans. Further, the performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under the Pension Plans. These assets are subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns, which may fall below our projected return rates. A decline in the market value of the Pension Plans\u2019 assets will increase the funding requirements under the Pension Plans if the actual asset returns do not recover these declines in value in the foreseeable future. Future pension funding requirements, and the timing of funding payments, may also be subject to changes in legislation. We are responsible for funding any shortfall of our Pension Plans\u2019 assets compared to obligations under the Pension Plans, and a significant increase in our pension liabilities could materially and adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. We are subject to the Pension Protection Act of 2006, which requires underfunded pension plans to improve their funding ratios within prescribed intervals based on the level of their underfunding. As a result, our required contributions to these plans, at times, have increased and may increase in the future. In addition, our pension and postemployment benefit plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. As interest rates decrease, the discounted liabilities increase benefit expense and funding requirements. Further, changes in demographics, including increased numbers of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions, may also increase the funding requirements for the obligations related to the pension and other postemployment benefit plans. Declines in market values and increased funding requirements could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Please see Note 9, \u201cBenefit Plans\u201d to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements of IPALCO in \u201cItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d included in this Form 10-K for further discussion.\nCounterparties providing materials or services may fail to perform their obligations, which could harm our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe enter into transactions with and rely on many counterparties in connection with our business, including for the purchase and delivery of inventory, including fuel and equipment components, for our capital improvements and additions and to provide\nprofessional services, such as actuarial calculations, payroll processing and various consulting services. If any of these counterparties fails to perform its obligations to us or becomes unavailable, our business plans may be materially disrupted, we may be forced to discontinue certain operations if a cost-effective alternative is not readily available or we may be forced to enter into alternative arrangements at then-current market prices that may exceed our contractual prices and cause delays. Although our agreements are designed to mitigate the consequences of a potential default by the counterparty, our actual exposure may be greater than the relief provided by these mitigation provisions. Any of the foregoing could result in regulatory actions, cost overruns, delays or other losses, any of which (or a combination of which) could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nFurther, our construction program calls for extensive expenditures for capital improvements and additions, including the installation of environmental upgrades, improvements to generation, transmission and distribution facilities, as well as other initiatives. As a result, we have engaged, and will continue to engage, numerous contractors and have entered into a number of agreements to acquire the necessary materials and/or obtain the required construction related services. In addition, some contracts provide for us to assume the risk of price escalation and availability of certain metals and key components. This could force us to enter into alternative arrangements at then-current market prices that may exceed our contractual prices and cause construction delays. It could also subject us to enforcement action by regulatory authorities to the extent that such a contractor failure resulted in a failure by IPL to comply with requirements or expectations, particularly with regard to the cost of the project. As a result of these events, we might incur losses or delays in completing construction.\nAccidental improprieties and undetected errors in our internal controls and information reporting could result in the disallowance of cost recovery, noncompliant disclosure or incorrect payment processing.\nOur internal controls, accounting policies and practices and internal information systems are designed to enable us to capture and process transactions and information in a timely and accurate manner in compliance with GAAP, laws and regulations, taxation requirements and federal securities laws and regulations in order to, among other things, disclose and report financial and other information in connection with the recovery of our costs and with our reporting requirements under federal securities, tax and other laws and regulations and to properly process payments. We have also implemented corporate governance, internal control and accounting policies and procedures in connection with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Our internal controls and policies have been and continue to be closely monitored by management and our Board of Directors. While we believe these controls, policies, practices and systems are adequate to verify data integrity, unanticipated and unauthorized actions of employees, temporary lapses in internal controls due to shortfalls in oversight or resource constraints could lead to improprieties and undetected errors that could result in the disallowance of cost recovery, noncompliant disclosure and reporting or incorrect payment processing. The consequences of these events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nNew accounting standards or changes to existing accounting standards could materially affect how we report our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The SEC, FASB or other authoritative bodies or governmental entities may issue new pronouncements or new interpretations of existing accounting standards that may require us to change our accounting policies. These changes are beyond our control, can be difficult to predict and could materially affect how we report our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, which could adversely affect our financial condition. In addition, in preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.\nWe are subject to extensive laws and local, state and federal regulation, as well as litigation and other proceedings that could affect our operations and costs.\nAs an electric utility, we are subject to extensive regulation at both the federal and state level. For example, at the federal level, we are regulated by the FERC and the NERC and, at the state level, we are regulated by the IURC. The regulatory power of the IURC over IPL is both comprehensive and typical of the traditional form of regulation generally imposed by state public utility commissions. We face the risk of unexpected or adverse regulatory action. Regulatory discretion is reasonably broad in Indiana. We are subject to regulation by the IURC as to our services and facilities, the valuation of property, the construction, purchase, or lease of electric generating facilities, the classification of accounts, rates of depreciation, the increase or decrease in retail rates and charges, the issuance of securities and incurrence of long-term debt, the acquisition and sale of some public utility properties or securities and certain other matters.\nOur tariff rates for electric service to retail customers consist of basic rates and charges and various adjustment mechanisms which are set and approved by the IURC after public hearings. Pursuant to statute, the IURC is to conduct a periodic review of the basic rates and charges of all Indiana utilities at least once every four years, but the IURC has the authority to review the rates of any Indiana utility at any time. Proceedings to review our basic rates and charges involve IPL, the IURC, the Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor and other interested stakeholders. Our basic rates and charges were last adjusted in 1996; however, IPL filed a petition with the IURC on December 29, 2014, for authority to increase its basic rates and charges. For additional information about this proceeding, please see \u201cItem 1. Business - Regulatory Matters\u201d. No assurances can be given as to the outcome of this proceeding. In addition, we must seek approval from the IURC through such public proceedings of our tracking mechanism factors to reflect changes in our fuel costs to generate electricity or purchased power costs and for the timely recovery of costs incurred during construction and operation of CCT facilities constructed to comply with environmental laws and regulations, recovery of costs associated with providing mandatory DSM programs, and for certain other costs. There can be no assurance that we will be granted approval of tracking mechanism factors that we request from the IURC. The failure of the IURC to approve any requested relief, or any other adverse rate determination by the IURC could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nAs a result of the EPAct and subsequent legislation affecting the electric utility industry, we have been required to comply with rules and regulations in areas including mandatory reliability standards, cyber security, transmission expansion and energy efficiency. We are currently unable to predict the long-term impact, if any, to our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows as a result of these rules and regulations. Complying with the regulatory environment to which we are subject requires us to expend a significant amount of funds and resources. The failure to comply with this regulatory environment could subject us to substantial financial costs and penalties and changes, either forced or voluntary, in the way we operate our business.\nIndependent of the IURC\u2019s ability to review basic rates and charges, Indiana law requires electric utilities under the jurisdiction of the IURC to meet operating expense and income test requirements as a condition for approval of requested changes in the FAC. Additionally, customer refunds may result if a utility\u2019s rolling twelve-month operating income, determined at quarterly measurement dates, exceeds a utility\u2019s authorized annual jurisdictional net operating income and there are not sufficient applicable cumulative net operating income deficiencies against which the excess rolling twelve-month jurisdictional net operating income can be offset.\nFuture events, including the advent of retail competition within IPL\u2019s service territory, could result in the deregulation of part of IPL\u2019s existing regulated business. Upon deregulation, adjustments to IPL\u2019s accounting records may be required to eliminate the historical impact of regulatory accounting. Such adjustments, as required by FASB ASC 980 \u201cRegulated Operations,\u201d could eliminate the effects of any actions of regulators that have been recognized as assets and liabilities. Required adjustments could include the expensing of any unamortized net regulatory assets, the elimination of certain tax liabilities, and a write down of any impaired utility plant balances. We expect IPL to meet the criteria for the application of ASC 980 for the foreseeable future.\nWe may be subject to material litigation, regulatory proceedings, administrative proceedings, audits, settlements, investigations and claims from time to time which may require us to expend significant funds to address. There can be no assurance that the outcome of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Asbestos and other regulated substances are, and may continue to be, present at our facilities. We have been named as a defendant in asbestos litigation, which at this time is not expected to be material to us. The presence of asbestos and other regulated substances at these facilities could result in additional litigation being brought against us, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Please see Note 2, \u201cRegulatory Matters\u201d and Note 10, \u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u201d to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements of IPALCO in \u201cItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d included in this Form 10-K for a summary of significant regulatory matters and legal proceedings involving us.\nIf we are unable to maintain a qualified and properly motivated workforce, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOne of the challenges we face is to retain a skilled, efficient and cost-effective workforce while recruiting new talent to replace losses in knowledge and skills due to resignations, terminations or retirements. This undertaking could require us to make additional financial commitments and incur increased costs. If we are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, we have employee compensation plans that reward the performance of our employees. We seek to ensure that our compensation plans encourage acceptable levels for risk and high performance through pay mix, performance metrics and timing. We also have policies and procedures in place to mitigate excessive risk-taking by employees since excessive risk-\ntaking by our employees to achieve performance targets could result in events that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe are subject to collective bargaining agreements that could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe are subject to collective bargaining agreements with employees who are members of a union. Approximately 65% of our employees are represented by a union in two bargaining units: a physical unit and a clerical-technical unit. While we believe that we maintain a satisfactory relationship with our employees, it is possible that labor disruptions affecting some or all of our operations could occur during the period of the collective bargaining agreements or at the expiration of the collective bargaining agreements before new agreements are negotiated. We may not be able to successfully train new personnel as current workers with significant knowledge and expertise retire. We also may be unable to staff our business with qualified personnel in the event of significant absenteeism related to a pandemic illness. Work stoppages by, or poor relations or ineffective negotiations with, our employees or other workforce issues could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nPotential security breaches (including cybersecurity breaches) and terrorism risks could adversely affect our businesses.\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated systems and network infrastructure at our generation stations, fuel storage facilities and transmission and distribution facilities. We also use various financial, accounting and other systems in our businesses. These systems and facilities are vulnerable to unauthorized access due to hacking, viruses, other cybersecurity attacks and other causes. In particular, given the importance of energy and the electric grid, there is the possibility that our systems and facilities could be targets of terrorism or acts of war. We have implemented measures to help prevent unauthorized access to our systems and facilities, including certain measures to comply with mandatory regulatory reliability standards. Despite our efforts, if our systems or facilities were to be breached or disabled, we may be unable to recover them in a timely way to fulfill critical business functions, including the supply of electric services to our customers, and we could experience decreases in revenues and increases in costs that could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nIn the course of our business, we also store and use customer, employee, and other personal information and other confidential and sensitive information. If our third party vendors\u2019 systems were to be breached or disabled, sensitive and confidential information and other data could be compromised, which could result in negative publicity, remediation costs and potential litigation, damages, consent orders, injunctions, fines and other relief.\nTo help mitigate these risks, we maintain insurance coverage against some, but not all, potential losses, including coverage for illegal acts against us. However, insurance may not be adequate to protect us against all costs and liabilities associated with these risks.\nIPALCO is a holding company and parent of IPL and other subsidiaries. IPALCO\u2019s cash flow is dependent on operating cash flows of IPL and its ability to pay cash to IPALCO.\nIPALCO is a holding company with no material assets other than the common stock of its subsidiaries, and accordingly all cash is generated by the operating activities of our subsidiaries, principally IPL. As such, IPALCO\u2019s cash flow is largely dependent on the operating cash flows of IPL and its ability to pay cash to IPALCO. IPL\u2019s mortgage and deed of trust, its amended articles of incorporation and its Credit Agreement and unsecured notes contain restrictions on IPL\u2019s ability to issue certain securities or pay cash dividends to IPALCO. For example, there are restrictions that require maintenance of a leverage ratio which could limit the ability of IPL to pay dividends. See \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Capital Resources and Liquidity\u201d for a discussion of these restrictions. See Note 7, \u201cDebt\u201d to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements of IPALCO in \u201cItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d included in this Form 10-K for information regarding indebtedness. In addition, IPL is regulated by the IURC, which possesses broad oversight powers to ensure that the needs of utility customers are being met. The IURC could impose additional restrictions on the ability of IPL to distribute, loan or advance cash to IPALCO pursuant to these broad powers. While we do not expect any of the foregoing restrictions to significantly affect IPL\u2019s ability to pay funds to IPALCO in the future, a significant limitation on IPL\u2019s ability to pay dividends or loan or advance funds to IPALCO would have a material adverse effect on IPALCO\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur ownership by AES subjects us to potential risks that are beyond our control.\nAll of IPL\u2019s common stock is owned by IPALCO, all of whose common stock is owned by AES U.S. Investments (88.4%) and CDPQ (11.6%). Due to our relationship with AES, any adverse developments and announcements concerning them may impair our ability to access the capital markets and to otherwise conduct business. In particular, downgrades in AES\u2019s credit ratings could result in IPL or IPALCO\u2019s credit ratings being downgraded.", "PERMNO": 21370, "SIC": 4911, "TIC": "AES4"}
