RISK FACTORS.\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below before making a decision to buy shares of our common stock. The order of the risks is not an indication of their relative weight or importance. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us but do represent those risks and uncertainties we believe are material to us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely impact and impair our business. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business could be harmed. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you might lose all or part of your investment. When determining whether to buy our common stock, you should also refer to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our financial statements and the related notes.\nA future economic downturn or change in the use of outsourced professional services consultants could adversely affect our business.\nWhile we believe general economic conditions continue to improve in most parts of the world, there is some uncertainty regarding general economic conditions within some regions and countries in which we operate, leading to reluctance on the part of some multinational companies to spend on discretionary projects. Deterioration of or increased uncertainty related to the global economy or tightening credit markets could result in a reduction in the demand for our services and adversely affect our business in the future. In addition, the use of professional services consultants on a project-by-project basis could decline for non-economic reasons. In the event of a reduction in the demand for our consultants, our financial results would suffer.\nEconomic deterioration at one or more of our clients may also affect our allowance for doubtful accounts. Our estimate of losses resulting from our clients\u2019 failure to make required payments for services rendered has historically been within our expectations and the provisions established. However, we cannot guarantee we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates we have in the past. A significant change in the liquidity or financial position of our clients could cause unfavorable trends in receivable collections and cash flows and additional allowances may be required. These additional allowances could materially affect the Company\u2019s future financial results.\nIn addition, we are required to periodically, but at least annually, assess the recoverability of certain assets, including deferred tax assets and goodwill. Softening of the United States economy and international economies could adversely affect our evaluation of the recoverability of deferred tax assets, requiring us to record additional tax valuation allowances. Our assessment of impairment of goodwill is currently based upon comparing our market capitalization to our net book value. Therefore, a significant downturn in the future market value of our stock could potentially result in impairment reductions of goodwill and such an adjustment could materially affect the Company\u2019s future financial results and financial condition.\nThe market for professional services is highly competitive, and if we are unable to compete effectively against our competitors, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nWe operate in a competitive, fragmented market, and we compete for clients and consultants with a variety of organizations that offer similar services. The competition is likely to increase in the future due to the expected growth of the market and the relatively few barriers to entry. Our principal competitors include:\n\u2022\nconsulting firms\n\u2022\nlocal, regional, national and international accounting and other traditional professional services firms\n\u2022\nindependent contractors\n\u2022\ntraditional and Internet-based staffing firms\n\u2022\nthe in-house or former in-house resources of our clients\nWe cannot assure you we will be able to compete effectively against existing or future competitors. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources, greater revenues and greater name recognition, which may afford them an advantage in attracting and retaining clients and consultants and in offering pricing concessions. Some of our competitors in certain markets do not provide medical and other benefits to their consultants, thereby allowing them to potentially charge lower rates to clients. In addition, our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to changes in companies\u2019 needs and developments in the professional services industry.\nOur business depends upon our ability to secure new projects from clients and, therefore, we could be adversely affected if we fail to do so.\nWe do not have long-term agreements with our clients for the provision of services and our clients may terminate engagements with us at any time. The success of our business is dependent on our ability to secure new projects from clients. For example, if we are unable to secure new client projects because of improvements in our competitors\u2019 service offerings, or because of a change in government regulatory requirements, or because of an economic downturn decreasing the demand for outsourced professional services, our business is likely to be materially adversely affected. New impediments to our ability to secure projects from clients may develop over time, such as the increasing use by large clients of in-house procurement groups that manage their relationship with service providers.\nWe may be legally liable for damages resulting from the performance of projects by our consultants or for our clients\u2019 mistreatment of our personnel.\nMany of our engagements with our clients involve projects or services critical to our clients\u2019 businesses. If we fail to meet our contractual obligations, we could be subject to legal liability or damage to our reputation, which could adversely affect our\nbusiness, operating results and financial condition. While we are not currently subject to any client-related legal claims which we believe are material, it remains possible, because of the nature of our business, we may be involved in litigation in the future that could materially affect our future financial results. Claims brought against us could have a serious negative effect on our reputation and on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause we are in the business of placing our personnel in the workplaces of other companies, we are subject to possible claims by our personnel alleging discrimination, sexual harassment, negligence and other similar activities by our clients. We may also be subject to similar claims from our clients based on activities by our personnel. The cost of defending such claims, even if groundless, could be substantial and the associated negative publicity could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain personnel and clients.\nWe may not be able to grow our business, manage our growth or sustain our current business.\nHistorically, we have grown by opening new offices and by increasing the volume of services provided through existing offices. Beginning late in fiscal 2017, we embarked on several new strategic initiatives, including the implementation of a new operating model to drive growth. While the roll-out of that operating model is complete in the United States, the adoption internationally is on going. Our ability to execute on those strategies or the disruptions related to implementation of the new operating model may impact or limit our ability to grow our business. Since the first quarter of fiscal 2010, we have had difficulty sustaining consistent revenue growth either quarter-over-quarter or in sequential quarters. During fiscal 2017 and 2018, we closed three offices in select markets. There can be no assurance we will be able to maintain or expand our market presence in our current locations or to successfully enter other markets or locations. Our ability to continue to grow our business will depend upon an improving global economy and a number of factors, including our ability to:\n\u2022\ngrow our client base\n\u2022\nexpand profitably into new geographies\n\u2022\nprovide additional professional services offerings\n\u2022\nhire qualified and experienced consultants\n\u2022\nmaintain margins in the face of pricing pressures\n\u2022\nmanage costs\n\u2022\nmaintain or grow revenues and increase other service offerings from existing clients\nEven if we are able to resume more rapid growth in our revenue, the growth will result in new and increased responsibilities for our management as well as increased demands on our internal systems, procedures and controls, and our administrative, financial, marketing and other resources. For instance, a limited number of clients are requesting certain engagements be of a fixed fee nature rather than our traditional hourly time and materials approach, thus shifting a portion of the burden of financial risk and monitoring to us. Failure to adequately respond to these new responsibilities and demands may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to serve clients internationally is integral to our strategy and our international activities expose us to additional operational challenges we might not otherwise face.\nOur international activities require us to confront and manage a number of risks and expenses we would not face if we conducted our operations solely in the United States. Any of these risks or expenses could cause a material negative effect on our operating results. These risks and expenses include:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing foreign offices as a result of, among other things, distance, language and cultural differences\n\u2022\nless flexible or future changes in labor laws and regulations in the U.S. and in foreign countries\n\u2022\nexpenses associated with customizing our professional services for clients in foreign countries\n\u2022\nforeign currency exchange rate fluctuations when we sell our professional services in denominations other than United States\u2019 dollars\n\u2022\nprotectionist laws and business practices that favor local companies\n\u2022\npolitical and economic instability in some international markets\n\u2022\nmultiple, conflicting and changing government laws and regulations\n\u2022\ntrade barriers\n\u2022\nreduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences\nWe have acquired, and may continue to acquire, companies, and these acquisitions could disrupt our business.\nWe have acquired several companies, including two during the 2018 fiscal year, and we may continue to acquire companies in the future. Entering into an acquisition entails many risks, any of which could harm our business, including:\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns\n\u2022\nfailure to integrate the acquired company with our existing business\n\u2022\nfailure to motivate, or loss of, key employees from either our existing business or the acquired business\n\u2022\nfailure to identify certain risks or liabilities during the due diligence process\n\u2022\npotential impairment of relationships with our existing employees and clients\n\u2022\nadditional operating expenses not offset by additional revenue\n\u2022\nincurrence of significant non-recurring charges\n\u2022\nincurrence of additional debt with restrictive covenants or other limitations\n\u2022\naddition of significant amounts of intangible assets, including goodwill, that are subject to periodic assessment of impairment, primarily through comparison of market value of our stock to our net book value, with such impairment potentially resulting in a material impact on our future financial results and financial condition\n\u2022\ndilution of our stock as a result of issuing equity securities\n\u2022\nassumption of liabilities of the acquired company\nOur failure to be successful in addressing these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions, incur unanticipated liabilities and harm our business generally.\nWe must provide our clients with highly qualified and experienced consultants, and the loss of a significant number of our consultants, or an inability to attract and retain new consultants, could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nOur business involves the delivery of professional services, and our success depends on our ability to provide our clients with highly qualified and experienced consultants who possess the skills and experience necessary to satisfy their needs. At various times, such professionals can be in great demand, particularly in certain geographic areas or if they have specific skill sets. Our ability to attract and retain consultants with the requisite experience and skills depends on several factors including, but not limited to, our ability to:\n\u2022\nprovide our consultants with either full-time or flexible-time employment\n\u2022\nobtain the type of challenging and high-quality projects our consultants seek\n\u2022\npay competitive compensation and provide competitive benefits\n\u2022\nprovide our consultants with flexibility as to hours worked and assignment of client engagements\nThere can be no assurance we will be successful in accomplishing any of these factors and, even if we are, we cannot assure we will be successful in attracting and retaining the number of highly qualified and experienced consultants necessary to maintain and grow our business.\nDecreased effectiveness of equity compensation could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain employees.\nWe have historically used stock options as a component of our employee compensation program in order to align employees\u2019 interests with the interests of our stockholders, encourage employee retention and provide competitive compensation packages. About 20% of our options outstanding as of the end of fiscal 2018, awarded prior to fiscal 2010, are priced at more than the current per share market value of our stock, limiting the grants from those years as a significant incentive to retain employees.\nOur computer hardware and software and telecommunications systems are susceptible to damage, breach or interruption.\nThe management of our business is aided by the uninterrupted operation of our computer and telecommunication systems. These systems are vulnerable to security breaches, natural disasters or other catastrophic events, computer viruses, or other interruptions or damage stemming from power outages, equipment failure or unintended usage by employees. In particular, our employees may have access or exposure to personally identifiable or otherwise confidential information and customer data and systems, the misuse of which could result in legal liability. In addition, we rely on information technology systems to process, transmit and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with our clients, partners and consultants. The breadth and complexity of this infrastructure increases the potential risk of security breaches. Security breaches, including cyber-attacks or cyber- intrusions by computer hackers, foreign governments, cyber terrorists or others with grievances against the industry in which we operate or us in particular, may disable or damage the proper functioning of our networks and systems. It is possible our security controls over personal and other data may not prevent unauthorized access to, or destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of personally identifiable or other proprietary, confidential, sensitive or valuable information of ours or others; this access could lead to potential unauthorized disclosure of confidential personal, Company or client information others could use to compete against us or for other disruptive, destructive or harmful purposes and outcomes. Any such disclosure or damage to our networks and systems could subject us to third party claims against us and reputational harm. If these events occur, our ability to attract new clients may be impaired or we may be subjected to damages or penalties. In addition, system-wide or local failures of these information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur cash and short-term investments are subject to economic risk.\nThe Company invests its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in foreign and domestic bank deposits, money market funds, commercial paper and certificates of deposit. Certain of these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks. In the event these risks caused a decline in value of any of the Company\u2019s investments, it could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition.\nOur business could suffer if we lose the services of one or more key members of our senior management.\nOur future success depends upon the continued employment of our senior management team. The unforeseen departure of one or more key members of our senior management team could significantly disrupt our operations if we are unable to successfully manage the transition. The replacement of members of senior management can involve significant time and expense and create uncertainties that could delay, prevent the achievement of, or make it more difficult for us to pursue and execute on our business opportunities, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nFurther, we generally do not have non-compete agreements with our employees and, therefore, they could terminate their employment with us at any time. Our ability to retain the services of members of our senior management and other key employees could be impacted by a number of factors, including competitors\u2019 hiring practices or the effectiveness of our compensation programs. If members of our senior management or other key employees leave our employ for any reason, they could pursue other employment opportunities with our competitors or otherwise compete with us. If we are unable to retain the services of these key personnel or attract and retain other qualified and experienced personnel on acceptable terms, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.\nOur quarterly financial results may be subject to significant fluctuations that may increase the volatility of our stock price.\nOur results of operations could vary significantly from quarter to quarter. Factors that could affect our quarterly operating results include:\n\u2022\nour ability to attract new clients and retain current clients\n\u2022\nthe mix of client projects\n\u2022\nthe announcement or introduction of new services by us or any of our competitors\n\u2022\nthe expansion of the professional services offered by us or any of our competitors into new locations both nationally and internationally\n\u2022\nchanges in the demand for our services by our clients\n\u2022\nthe entry of new competitors into any of our markets\n\u2022\nthe number of consultants eligible for our offered benefits as the average length of employment with the Company increases\n\u2022\nthe amount of vacation hours used by consultants or number of holidays in a quarter, particularly the day of the week on which they occur\n\u2022\navailability of consultants with the requisite skills in demand by clients\n\u2022\nchanges in the pricing of our professional services or those of our competitors\n\u2022\nvariation in foreign exchange rates from one quarter to the next used to translate the financial results of our international operations\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to management and expansion of our business\n\u2022\nthe timing of acquisitions and related costs, such as compensation charges that fluctuate based on the market price of our common stock\n\u2022\nthe periodic fourth quarter consisting of 14 weeks, which occurred during the fiscal year ended May 31, 2014 and next occurs during the fiscal year ending May 30, 2020\nDue to these factors, we believe quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our results of operations are not meaningful indicators of future performance. It is possible that in some future periods, our results of operations may be below the expectations of investors. If this occurs, the price of our common stock could decline.\nIf our internal control over financial reporting does not comply with the requirements of Sarbanes, our business and stock price could be adversely affected.\nSection 404 of Sarbanes requires us to evaluate periodically the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, and to include a management report assessing the effectiveness of our internal controls as of the end of each fiscal year. Our management report on internal controls is contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Section 404 also requires our independent registered public accountant to report on our internal control over financial reporting.\nOur management does not expect our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors or acts of fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance the control system\u2019s objectives will be met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, involving us have been, or will be, detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. Controls can also be circumvented by individual acts of a person, or by collusion among two or more people, or by management override of controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain\nassumptions about the likelihood of future events, and we cannot assure you any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies and procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to errors or fraudulent acts may occur and not be detected.\nAlthough our management has determined, and our independent registered public accountant has attested, that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of May 26, 2018, we cannot assure you that we or our independent registered public accountant will not identify a material weakness in our internal controls in the future. A material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting may require management and our independent registered public accountant to evaluate our internal controls as ineffective. If our internal control over financial reporting is not considered adequate, we may experience a loss of public confidence, which could have an adverse effect on our business and our stock price. Additionally, if our internal control over financial reporting otherwise fails to comply with the requirements of Sarbanes, our business and stock price could be adversely affected.\nWe may be subject to laws and regulations that impose difficult and costly compliance requirements and subject us to potential liability and the loss of clients.\nIn connection with providing services to clients in certain regulated industries, such as the gaming, energy and healthcare industries, we are subject to industry-specific regulations, including licensing and reporting requirements. Complying with these requirements is costly and, if we fail to comply, we could be prevented from rendering services to clients in those industries in the future. Additionally, changes in these requirements, or in other laws applicable to us, in the future could increase our costs of compliance.\nIn addition, we may face challenges from certain state regulatory bodies governing the provision of certain professional services, such as legal services or audit services. The imposition of such regulations could require additional financial and operational burdens on our business.\nIt may be difficult for a third party to acquire the Company, and this could depress our stock price.\nDelaware corporate law and our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could delay, defer or prevent a change of control of the Company or our management. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. As a result, these provisions could limit the price future investors are willing to pay for your shares. These provisions:\n\u2022\nauthorize our board of directors to establish one or more series of undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which can be determined by the board of directors at the time of issuance\n\u2022\ndivide our board of directors into three classes of directors, with each class serving a staggered three-year term. Because the classification of the board of directors generally increases the difficulty of replacing a majority of the directors, it may tend to discourage a third party from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us and may make it difficult to change the composition of the board of directors\n\u2022\nprohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors which, if not prohibited, could allow a minority stockholder holding a sufficient percentage of a class of shares to ensure the election of one or more directors\n\u2022\nrequire that any action required or permitted to be taken by our stockholders must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders and may not be effected by any consent in writing\n\u2022\nstate that special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by the chairman of the board of directors, by our chief executive officer, by the board of directors after a resolution is adopted by a majority of the total number of authorized directors, or by the holders of not less than 10% of our outstanding voting stock\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for submitting nominations for election to the board of directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at a meeting\n\u2022\nprovide that certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws can be amended only by supermajority vote (a 66 2/3 % majority) of the outstanding shares. In addition, our board of directors can amend our bylaws by majority vote of the members of our board of directors\n\u2022\nallow our directors, not our stockholders, to fill vacancies on our board of directors\n\u2022\nprovide that the authorized number of directors may be changed only by resolution of the board of directors\nWe are required to recognize compensation expense related to employee stock options and our employee stock purchase plan. There is no assurance the expense we are required to recognize measures accurately the value of our share-based payment awards and the recognition of this expense could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.\nWe measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock-based compensation based on estimated values. Thus, our operating results contain a non-cash charge for stock-based compensation expense related to employee stock options and our employee stock purchase plan. In general, accounting guidance requires the use of an option-pricing model to determine the value of share-based payment awards. This determination of value is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors. Option-pricing models were developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. Because our employee stock options have certain characteristics that are significantly different from traded options, and because changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimated value, in management\u2019s opinion the existing valuation models may not provide an accurate measure of the value of our employee stock options. Although the value of employee stock options is determined using an option-pricing model, that value may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyer/willing seller market transaction.\nThe terms of our credit facility impose operating and financial restrictions on us, which may limit our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions.\nWe currently have a $120.0 million secured revolving credit facility which is available through October 21, 2021. We are subject to various operating covenants under the credit facility which restrict our ability to, among other things, incur liens, incur additional indebtedness, make certain restricted payments, merge or consolidate and make dispositions of assets. The credit facility also requires us to comply with financial covenants limiting our total funded debt, minimum interest coverage ratio and maximum leverage ratio. Any failure to comply with these covenants may constitute a breach under the credit facility, which could result in the acceleration of all or a substantial portion of any outstanding indebtedness and termination of revolving credit commitments under the credit facility. Our inability to maintain our credit facility could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and our business.\nWe may be unable to or elect not to pay our quarterly dividend payment.\nThe Company currently pays a regular quarterly dividend, subject to quarterly board of director approval. The payment of, or continuation of, the quarterly dividend is at the discretion of our board of directors and is dependent upon our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, general business conditions, tax treatment of dividends in the United States, contractual restrictions contained in credit agreements and other agreements and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. We can give no assurance that dividends will be declared and paid in the future. The failure to pay the quarterly dividend, reduction of the quarterly dividend rate or the discontinuance of the quarterly dividend could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nFailure to comply with data privacy laws and regulations could have a materially adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations or financial condition, or have other adverse consequences.\nThe collection, hosting, transfer, disclosure, use, storage and security of personal information required to provide our services is subject to federal, state and foreign data privacy laws. These laws, which are not uniform, do one or more of the following: regulate the collection, transfer (including in some cases, the transfer outside the country of collection), processing, storage, use\nand disclosure of personal information, require notice to individuals of privacy practices; give individuals certain access and correction rights with respect to their personal information; and prevent the use or disclosure of personal information for secondary purposes such as marketing. Under certain circumstances, some of these laws require us to provide notification to affected individuals, data protection authorities and/or other regulators in the event of a data breach. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information among the Company and its subsidiaries. In addition, the European Union adopted a comprehensive General Data Protection Regulation (the \u201cGDPR\u201d) in May 2016 that will replace the current EU Data Protection Directive and related country-specific legislation. The GDPR became fully effective in May 2018. Complying with the enhanced obligations imposed by the GDPR may result in additional costs to our business and require us to amend certain of our business practices. Further, enforcement actions and investigations by regulatory authorities related to data security incidents and privacy violations continue to increase. It is possible that future enactment of more restrictive laws, rules or regulations and/or future enforcement actions or investigations could have an adverse impact on us through increased costs or restrictions on our businesses and noncompliance could result in regulatory penalties and significant legal liability.\nWe may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, including our brand name. If we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, the value of such rights may diminish and our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nWe believe establishing, maintaining and enhancing the RGP and Resources Global Professionals brand name is important to our business. We have applied for registration in the United States and some foreign jurisdictions with respect to certain service marks. We own United States trademark registrations for our RGP service mark and puzzle piece logo, Reg. No. 4,649.837; our RGP service mark, puzzle piece and tag line, Reg. No. 4,649.838; our RGP Healthcare service mark and puzzle piece logo, Reg. No. 4,649.839; our RGP Legal service mark and puzzle piece logo, Reg. No. 4,649.840; and our RGP Search service mark and puzzle piece logo, Reg. No. 4,649.841.\nIn addition, we obtained a United States registration for the Resources Global Professionals mark, Registration No. 3,298,841 September 25, 2007. We are in the process of renewing this registration. However, our rights to this service mark are not currently protected in some of our foreign registrations, and there is no guarantee any of our pending applications for such registration (or any appeals thereof or future applications) will be successful.\nIf another party adopts or uses a name, service mark or trademark similar to ours, they could make infringement claims against us or could thereby impede our ability to build brand identity if they have prior rights. We cannot assure you our business would not be adversely affected if such a claim was made or if we were required to change our name.", "PERMNO": 88841, "SIC": 8721, "TIC": "RGP"}
