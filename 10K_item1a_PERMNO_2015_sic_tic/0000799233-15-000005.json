RISK FACTORS\nOur future results may be affected by a number of factors over which we have little or no control. The following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements as discussed in \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" above. The following issues, uncertainties, and risks, among others, should be considered in evaluating our business and growth outlook. If any of the following risk factors, as well as other risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to us or that we currently believe are not material, actually occur, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected and you may lose all or a significant part of your investment.\nOur business is subject to general economic and business factors affecting the trucking industry that are largely out of our control, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our operating results.\nThe truckload industry is highly cyclical and our business is dependent on a number of factors that may have a negative impact on our results of operations, many of which are beyond our control. We believe that some of the most significant of these factors are economic changes that affect supply and demand, in transportation markets, such as:\n\u2022\nrecessionary economic conditions and downturns in customers\u2019 business cycles;\n\u2022\nchanges in customers\u2019 inventory levels and in the availability of funding for their working capital;\n\u2022\nexcess tractor and trailer capacity in comparison with shipping demand;\n\u2022\nthe rate of unemployment and availability of and compensation for alternative jobs for truck drivers;\n\u2022\nactivity in key economic indicators such as manufacturing of automobiles and durable goods, and housing construction;\n\u2022\nsupply chain disruptions due to factors such as weather, strikes or slowdowns affecting ports and other shipping locations or other transportation providers, and railroad congestion; and\n\u2022\nchanges in interest rates.\nConditions that decrease shipping demand or increase the supply of tractors and trailers can exert downward pressure on rates and equipment utilization, thereby decreasing asset productivity. The risks associated with these factors are heightened when the U.S. economy is weakened. Some of the principal risks of such conditions are as follows:\n\u2022\nwe may experience a reduction in overall freight levels, which may impair our asset utilization;\n\u2022\ncertain of our customers may face credit issues and could experience cash flow problems that may lead to payment delays, increased credit risk, bankruptcies and other financial hardships that could result in even lower freight demand and may require us to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts;\n\u2022\nfreight patterns may change as supply chains are redesigned, resulting in an imbalance between our capacity and our customers\u2019 freight demand;\n\u2022\ncustomers may solicit bids for freight from multiple trucking companies or select competitors that offer lower rates from among existing choices in an attempt to lower their costs and we might be forced to lower our rates or lose freight;\n\u2022\nwe may be forced to accept more freight from freight brokers, where freight rates are typically lower, or may be forced to incur more non-revenue miles to obtain loads; and\n\u2022\nthe resale value of our equipment may decline, which could negatively impact our earnings and cash flows.\nWe also are subject to potential increases in various costs and other events that are outside of our control that could materially reduce our profitability if we are unable to increase our rates sufficiently. Such cost increases include, but are not limited to, fuel\nand energy prices, taxes and interest rates, tolls, license and registration fees, insurance premiums, revenue equipment and related maintenance costs, and healthcare and other benefits for our employees. We cannot predict whether, or in what form, any such cost increase or event could occur. Any such cost increase or event could adversely affect our profitability.\nIn addition, we cannot predict future economic conditions, fuel price fluctuations or how consumer confidence could be affected by actual or threatened armed conflicts or terrorist attacks, government efforts to combat terrorism, military action against a foreign state or group located in a foreign state, or heightened security requirements. Enhanced security measures could impair our operating efficiency and productivity and result in higher operating costs.\nOur growth may not continue at historical rates, if at all, and any decrease in revenues or profits may impair our ability to implement our business strategy, which could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations.\nHistorically, we have experienced significant and rapid growth in revenue and profits. There can be no assurance that our business will continue to grow in a similar fashion in the future, or at all, or that we can effectively adapt our management, administrative, and operational systems to respond to any future growth. Further, there can be no assurance that our operating margins will not be adversely affected by future changes in and expansion of our business or by changes in economic conditions.\nWe have established terminals throughout the United States in order to serve markets in various regions. These regional operations require the commitment of additional personnel and revenue equipment, as well as management resources, for future development and establishing terminals and operations in new markets could require more time, resources or a more substantial financial commitment than anticipated. Should the growth in our regional operations stagnate or decline, the results of our operations could be adversely affected. As we continue to expand, it may become more difficult to identify large cities that can support a terminal and we may expand into smaller cities where there is insufficient economic activity, fewer opportunities for growth and fewer drivers and non-driver personnel to support the terminal. We may encounter operating conditions in these new markets, as well as our current markets, that differ substantially from our current operations and customer relationships and appropriate freight rates in new markets could be challenging to attain. These challenges may negatively impact our growth, which could have a materially adverse effect on our ability to execute our business strategy and our results of operations.\nWe are highly dependent on a few major customers, the loss of one or more of which could have a materially adverse effect on our business.\nA significant portion of our operating revenue is generated from several major customers. For the year ended December 31, 2014, our top 25 customers, based on operating revenue, accounted for approximately 68% of our operating revenue. We cannot assure you that our customer relationships will continue as presently in effect or that we will receive our current customer rate levels in the future. A reduction in freight volumes or our services or termination of our services by one or more of our major customers, could have a materially adverse effect on our business and operating results. In addition, if any of our major customers experience financial hardship, the demand for our services could decrease, which could negatively affect our operating results.\nIndebtedness under our Credit Agreement could have adverse consequences on our future operations.\nPrior to the acquisition of GTI, we had not had outstanding indebtedness since the third quarter of 1997. Accordingly, we had not been required to devote any cash flows from operations to debt service payments, and we were not subject to affirmative and negative covenants customarily in a bank debt facility that impose restrictions on the operation of our business. In conjunction with the acquisition of GTI, we entered into a five-year, unsecured credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d), in the original amount of $250.0 million. The Credit Agreement includes periodic, permanent reductions in the lending commitment during the term of the facility. As of November 1, 2014, the lending commitment was reduced to $225.0 million. At December 31, 2014, we had $24.6 million outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement. As of January 31, 2015, we had no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement. Any indebtedness under the Credit Agreement could have adverse consequences on our future operations, including:\n\u2022\nresulting in an event of default if we fail to comply with the financial and other covenants contained in the Credit Agreement, which could result in all of our debt thereunder becoming immediately due and payable;\n\u2022\nreducing the availability of our cash flows to fund organic growth, working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, stock repurchases, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to and increasing our vulnerability to, changes in our business, the industry in which we operate and the general economy; and\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are inadequate to service our obligations under the Credit Agreement, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. In the event that we need to refinance all or a portion of our outstanding debt before maturity or as it matures, we may be unable to obtain terms as favorable as the current terms of the Credit Agreement.\nWe have significant ongoing capital requirements that could affect our profitability if we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operations and obtain financing on favorable terms.\nThe truckload industry is capital intensive, and our historical policy of operating late-model revenue equipment requires us to invest significant amounts annually to maintain a newer average age for our fleet of revenue equipment. We expect to pay for projected capital expenditures with cash flows from operations, proceeds from sales of equipment being replaced, and perhaps with proceeds of borrowings. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operations, or proceeds from sales of equipment being replaced, or utilize borrowing capacity on our Credit Agreement, we would need to seek alternative sources of capital, including additional financing, to meet our capital requirements. In the event that we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operations or obtain additional financing on favorable terms in the future, we may have to limit our fleet size, enter into less favorable financing arrangements, or operate our revenue equipment for longer periods, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our profitability.\nIncreased prices, reduced productivity, and restricted availability of new revenue equipment and decreased demand and value of used equipment may adversely affect our earnings and cash flows.\nWe are subject to risk with respect to higher prices for new tractors. Prices may increase due to, among other reasons, (i) increases in commodity prices, (ii) government regulations applicable to newly manufactured tractors, trailers and diesel engines and (iii) the pricing discretion of equipment manufacturers. In addition, the engines installed in our newer tractors are subject to emissions control regulations issued by the EPA. The regulations require reductions in exhaust emissions from diesel engines manufactured in or after 2010. Compliance with such regulations has increased the cost of our new tractors and could impair equipment productivity, lower fuel mileage and increase our operating expenses. These adverse effects, combined with the uncertainty as to the reliability of the vehicles equipped with the newly designed diesel engines and the residual values realized from the disposition of these vehicles, could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business or operations as the regulations become effective.\nThe market for used equipment is cyclical and can be volatile, and any downturn in the market could negatively impact our earnings and cash flows. In recent periods, we have recognized significant gains on the sale of our used tractors and trailers, in part because of a strong used equipment market. During periods of lower used equipment values, we may generate lower gains on sale, which would reduce our earnings and cash flows, and could adversely impact our liquidity and financial condition. Alternatively, we could decide, or be forced, to operate our equipment longer, which could negatively impact maintenance and repairs expense, customer service, and driver satisfaction.\nIf diesel fuel prices increase significantly, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur operations are dependent upon diesel fuel. Prices and availability of petroleum products are subject to political, economic, weather-related, geographic and market factors that are outside our control and each of which may lead to fluctuations in the cost of fuel. Because our operations are dependent upon diesel fuel, significant increases in diesel fuel costs could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition if we are unable to pass increased costs on to customers through rate increases or fuel surcharges. Even if we are able to pass some increased costs on to customers, fuel surcharge programs\ngenerally do not protect us against all of the increases in fuel prices. Moreover, in times of rising fuel prices, the lag between purchasing the fuel, and the billing for the surcharge (which typically is based on the prior week's average price), can negatively impact our earnings and cash flows. In addition, the terms of each customer's fuel surcharge agreement vary, and customers may seek to modify the terms of their fuel surcharge agreements to minimize recoverability for fuel price increases. Our results of operations and cash flows would be negatively affected to the extent we cannot recover higher fuel costs or fail to improve our fuel price protection through our fuel surcharge program. Increases in fuel prices, or a shortage or rationing of diesel fuel, could also materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nDifficulty in attracting and retaining drivers, including independent contractors, may have a materially adverse effect on our business.\nDifficulty in attracting or retaining qualified drivers, including independent contractors, could have a materially adverse effect on our growth and profitability. Competition for drivers, which has been historically intense, may increase even more as the overall demand for freight services increases with improvements in economic conditions. We have seen evidence that CSA and stricter hours-of-service (\u201cHOS\u201d) regulations adopted by the United States DOT in July 2013 have tightened, and may continue to tighten, the market for eligible drivers. If a shortage of drivers were to occur, or if we were unable to attract and contract with independent contractors, we could be forced to, among other things, limit our growth, decrease the number of our tractors in service, or adjust our driver compensation package or independent contractor compensation, which could adversely affect our profitability and results of operations if not offset by a corresponding increase in customer rates. In addition, our independent contractors are responsible for paying for their own equipment, fuel and other operating costs. Significant increases in these costs could cause them to seek higher compensation from us or seek other opportunities within or outside the trucking industry.\nIf our independent contractors are deemed by regulators or judicial process to be employees, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nTax and other regulatory authorities have in the past sought to assert that independent contractors in the trucking industry are employees rather than independent contractors. Members of Congress have frequently proposed federal legislation that would make it easier to reclassify independent contractors as employees and impose increased recordkeeping and compliance obligations on businesses that use independent contractors. Some states have put initiatives in place to increase their revenues from items such as unemployment, workers\u2019 compensation and income taxes, and a reclassification of independent contractors as employees would help states with this initiative. Further, class actions and other lawsuits have been filed in our industry seeking to reclassify independent contractors as employees for a variety of purposes, including workers\u2019 compensation and health care coverage. Taxing and other regulatory authorities and courts apply a variety of standards in their determination of independent contractors\u2019 status. If our independent contractors are determined to be our employees, we would incur additional exposure under federal and state tax, workers\u2019 compensation, unemployment benefits, labor, employment and tort laws, including for prior periods, as well as potential liability for employee benefits and tax withholdings.\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry and increased costs of compliance with, or liability for violation of, existing or future regulations could have a materially adverse effect on our business.\nWe operate in the United States pursuant to operating authority granted by the DOT. Our company drivers and independent contractors also must comply with the safety and fitness regulations of the DOT, including those relating to CSA safety performance and measurements, drug and alcohol testing and HOS. Weight and equipment dimensions also are subject to government regulations. We also may become subject to new or more restrictive regulations relating to exhaust emissions, drivers' HOS, ergonomics, ELDs, collective bargaining, security at ports, and other matters affecting safety or operating methods.\nIn July 2012, Congress passed a federal transportation bill that requires promulgation of rules mandating the use of ELDs by July 2013 with full adoption for all trucking companies no later than July 2015. In March 2014, the FMCSA announced a Supplemental Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to mandate ELDs. The effective date and publication date in the Federal Register were not announced. The rule will go into effect two years after the final rule is issued. It is uncertain if this adoption date will be challenged or extended. We believe the ELD mandate, together with the revised HOS rules and other regulations, could result in a reduction in effective trucking capacity to service increased demand. Although we are not currently required to install ELDs in our tractors, we have proactively installed ELDs. Since December 31, 2011, 100% of our over-the-road tractors have had ELDs installed including electronic logs. Such installation could cause an increase in driver turn-over, information that can be used in litigation, cost increases, and decreased asset utilization.\nFederal, state, and municipal authorities have implemented and continue to implement various security measures, including checkpoints and travel restrictions on large trucks. The TSA has adopted regulations that require a determination by the TSA that each driver who applies for or renews his or her license for carrying hazardous materials is not a security threat. This could reduce\nthe pool of qualified drivers, which could require us to increase driver compensation, limit our fleet growth, or let trucks sit idle. These regulations also could complicate the matching of available equipment with hazardous material shipments, thereby increasing our response time on customer orders and our non-revenue miles. As a result, it is possible we may fail to meet the needs of our customers or may incur increased expenses to do so. These security measures could negatively impact our operating results.\nSome states and municipalities have begun to restrict the locations and amount of time where diesel-powered tractors, such as ours, may idle, in order to reduce exhaust emissions. These restrictions could force us to alter our drivers\u2019 behavior, purchase on-board power units (for portions of our tractor fleet that do not currently have them) that do not require the engine to idle, or face a decrease in productivity.\nFuture laws and regulations may be more stringent and require changes in our operating practices, influence the demand for transportation services or require us to incur significant additional costs. Higher costs incurred by us or by our suppliers who pass the costs on to us through higher prices could adversely affect our results of operations. The Regulation section in Item 1 of this Annual Report discusses several proposed, pending, and final regulations that could significantly impact our business and operations.\nSafety-related evaluations and rankings under CSA could adversely affect our profitability and operations, our ability to maintain or grow our fleet, and our customer relationships.\nUnder CSA, drivers and fleets are evaluated and ranked based on certain safety-related standards. The methodology for determining a carrier's DOT safety rating has been expanded to include the on-road safety performance of the carrier's drivers. As a result, certain current and potential drivers may no longer be eligible to drive for us, our fleet could be ranked poorly as compared to our peers, and our safety rating could be adversely impacted. A reduction in eligible drivers or a poor fleet ranking may result in difficulty attracting and retaining qualified drivers, including impacting our number of unmanned trucks, and could cause our customers to direct their business away from us and to carriers with higher fleet rankings, which would adversely affect our results of operations. Additionally, competition for drivers with favorable safety ratings may increase and thus provide for increases in driver related compensation cost. One of our subsidiaries has recently exceeded the established intervention threshold in one of the seven safety-related standards of CSA. Based on this unfavorable rating, we may be prioritized for an intervention action or roadside inspection. In addition, from time to time we could further exceed the FMCSA's established intervention thresholds under certain categories, which could also cause our drivers to be prioritized for intervention action or roadside inspection by regulatory authorities. Such action or inspection could adversely affect our results of operations and we may incur greater than expected expenses in our attempts to improve our scores.\nOur operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations, the violation of which could result in substantial fines or penalties.\nIn addition to direct regulation by the DOT and other agencies, we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the handling of hazardous materials, waste oil, underground fuel storage tanks, and discharge and retention of storm-water. We operate in industrial areas, where truck terminals and other industrial facilities are located and where groundwater or other forms of environmental contamination have occurred. Our operations involve the risks of fuel spillage or seepage, environmental damage and hazardous waste disposal, among others. We also maintain bulk waste oil or fuel storage and fuel islands at the majority of our facilities. If (i) we are involved in a spill or other accident involving hazardous substances, (ii) there are releases of hazardous substances we transport, (iii) soil or groundwater contamination is found at our facilities or results from our operations or (iv) we are found to be in violation of or fail to comply with applicable environmental laws or regulations, then we could be subject to clean-up costs and liabilities, including substantial fines or penalties or civil and criminal liability, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nOur business also is subject to the effects of new tractor engine design requirements implemented by the EPA. In August 2011, the NHTSA and EPA adopted a new rule that established the first-ever fuel economy and greenhouse gas standards for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles, which include tractors we utilize. These standards apply to model years 2014 to 2018, which are required to achieve an approximate 20% reduction in fuel consumption by 2018. In addition, President Barack Obama announced that his administration will begin developing the next phase of tighter fuel efficiency standards for medium and heavy-duty vehicles, including tractors, and directed the EPA and NHTSA to develop new fuel-efficiency and greenhouse gas standards by March 31, 2016. Additional changes in the laws and regulations governing or impacting our industry could affect the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or by influencing the demand for, and the costs of providing, services to shippers.\nWe are exposed to risks related to our acquisition of GTI and we may not be able to achieve the benefits we expected at the time of the acquisition. Any failure to implement our business strategy with respect to the GTI acquisition could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have partially completed the integration of GTI\u2019s business into our own. However, additional activities, remain to be completed, and many of these activities involve third parties, including customers, drivers, and suppliers, whose actions are out of our control. We have not yet achieved, and may never achieve, the full benefit of the revenue enhancements and cost savings we expected at the time of the acquisition. In addition, even if we achieve the expected benefits, we may be unable to achieve them within the anticipated time frame. Also, the cost savings and other benefits may be offset by unexpected costs incurred in integrating GTI, increases in other expenses, or problems in the business unrelated to the GTI acquisition. If the integration is not successful, or if we fail to implement our business strategy with respect to the acquisition, we may be unable to achieve expected results and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nSpecific risks associated with the remaining integration include the following:\n\u2022\nthe potential loss of customers, employees, suppliers, other business partners or independent contractors;\n\u2022\nfailure to effectively consolidate functional areas, which may be impeded by inconsistencies in, or conflicts between, standards, controls, procedures, policies, business cultures and compensation structures;\n\u2022\npotential future impairment charges, write-offs, write-downs or restructuring charges that could adversely affect our results of operations;\n\u2022\nsignificant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting;\n\u2022\nincreased tax liability or other tax risk if future earnings are less than anticipated, there is a change in the deductibility of items, or we are unable realize the benefits of a special tax election referred to as a \u201cSection 338(h)(10) election\u201d;\n\u2022\nexposure to unknown liabilities or other obligations of GTI, which may include matters relating to employment, labor and employee benefits, litigation, accident claims and environmental issues, and which may affect our ability to comply with applicable laws;\n\u2022\nthe ongoing integration and management of technologies and services of the two companies, including the consolidation and integration of information systems;\n\u2022\nthe coordination of resources across broad geographical areas;\n\u2022\nthe loss of truck drivers of GTI or our historical operations due to differences in pay, policies, business culture, branding, or other factors, or an increase in costs of recruiting and retaining truck drivers; and\n\u2022\nthe challenges of moving toward a single brand and market identity.\nWe may not make acquisitions in the future, or if we do, we may not be successful in integrating the acquired company, either of which could have a materially adverse effect on our business.\nHistorically, acquisitions have been a part of our growth. There is no assurance that we will be successful in identifying, negotiating, or consummating any future acquisitions. If we fail to make any future acquisitions, our growth rate could be materially and adversely affected. Any additional acquisitions we undertake could involve the dilutive issuance of equity securities, incurring indebtedness and/or incurring large one-time expenses. In addition, acquisitions involve numerous risks, including difficulties in assimilating the acquired company's operations, the diversion of our management's attention from other business concerns, risks of entering into markets in which we have had no or only limited direct experience, and the potential loss of customers, key employees and drivers of the acquired company, all of which could have a materially adverse effect on our business and operating results. If we make acquisitions in the future, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully integrate the acquired companies or assets into our business, which would have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to retain our key employees or find, develop and retain terminal managers, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe are highly dependent upon the services of several executive officers and key management employees. The loss of any of their services could have a short-term, negative impact on our operations and profitability. We currently do not have employment agreements with any of our key employees or executive officers, and the loss of any of their services could negatively impact our operations and future profitability. We must continue to develop and retain a core group of managers if we are to realize our goal of expanding our operations and continuing our growth. Failing to develop and retain a core group of managers could have a materially adverse effect on our business.\nSeasonality and the impact of weather affect our operations and profitability.\nOur tractor productivity decreases during the winter season because inclement weather impedes operations, and some shippers reduce their shipments after the winter holiday season. Revenue can also be affected by bad weather and holidays, since revenue is directly related to available working days of shippers. At the same time, operating expenses increase and fuel efficiency declines because of engine idling and harsh weather, which creates higher accident frequency, increased claims, and more equipment repairs. We can also suffer short-term impacts from weather-related events such as hurricanes, blizzards, ice storms, and floods that could harm our results or make our results more volatile. Weather and other seasonal events could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe self-insure for a significant portion of our claims exposure, which could significantly increase the volatility of, and decrease the amount of, our earnings.\nOur future insurance and claims expense might exceed historical levels, which could reduce our earnings. We self-insure for a portion of our claims exposure resulting from workers\u2019 compensation, auto liability, general liability, cargo and property damage claims, as well as employees\u2019 health insurance. We are also responsible for our legal expenses relating to such claims. We reserve currently for anticipated losses and related expenses. We periodically evaluate and adjust our claims reserves to reflect trends in our own experience as well as industry trends. However, ultimate results may differ from our estimates, which could result in losses over our reserved amounts. We do not currently maintain directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance coverage, although we are obligated to indemnify them against certain liabilities they may incur while serving in such capacities.\nWe maintain insurance with licensed insurance carriers for the amounts in excess of our self-insured portion. It is possible that one or more claims could exceed our aggregate coverage limits. Insurance carriers that provide excess insurance coverage to us currently and for past claim years have encountered financial issues. Insurance carriers have raised premiums for many businesses, including trucking companies. As a result, our insurance and claims expense could increase, or we could raise our self-insured retention when our policies are renewed or replaced. If these expenses increase, or if we experience a claim in excess of our coverage limits, we experience a claim for which coverage is not provided or we experience a claim that is covered and our insurance company fails to perform, results of our operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe are dependent on computer and communications systems, and a systems failure could cause a significant disruption to our business.\nOur business depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer and communications hardware systems and infrastructure including our communications with our fleet of revenue equipment. We currently use a centralized computer network and regular communication to achieve system-wide load coordination. Our operating system is critical to understanding customer demands, accepting and planning loads, dispatching drivers and equipment, and billing and collecting for our services. Our operations and those of our technology and communications service providers are vulnerable to interruption by fire, earthquake, power loss, telecommunications failure, terrorist attacks, internet failures, computer viruses, deliberate attacks of unauthorized access to systems, denial-of-service attacks on websites and other events beyond our control. If any of our critical systems fail or become otherwise unavailable, whether as a result of the upgrade project or otherwise, we would have to perform the functions manually, which could temporarily impact our ability to manage our fleet efficiently, to respond to customers\u2019 requests effectively, to maintain billing and other records reliably and to bill for services and prepare financial statements accurately or in a timely manner. Any significant system failure, upgrade complication, security breach or other system disruption could interrupt or delay our operations, damage our reputation, cause us to lose customers or impact our ability to manage our operations and report our financial performance, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our business.\nConcentrated ownership of our stock can influence stockholder decisions, may discourage a change in control, and may have an adverse effect on share price of our stock.\nInvestors who purchase our common stock may be subject to certain risks due to the concentrated ownership of our common stock. The Gerdin family, our directors, and our executive officers, as a group, own or control approximately 49% of our common stock. This ownership concentration may have the effect of discouraging, delaying, or preventing a change in control, and may also have an adverse effect on the market price of our shares. As a result of their ownership, the Gerdin family, the executive officers and directors, as a group, may have the ability to influence the outcome of any matter submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors. This concentration of ownership could limit the price that some investors might be willing to pay for our common stock, and could allow the Gerdin family to prevent or could discourage or delay a change of control, which other stockholders may favor. Further, our bylaws have been amended to \u201copt out\u201d of the Nevada control share statute. Accordingly, an acquisition of more than a majority of our common stock by the Gerdin family will not result in certain shares in excess of a majority losing their voting rights and may enhance the Gerdin family's ability to exercise control over decisions affecting us. The interests of the Gerdin family may conflict with the interests of other holders of our common stock, and they may take actions affecting us with which other stockholders disagree.\nEfforts by labor unions could divert management's attention and could have a materially adverse effect on our operating results.\nAny attempt to organize by our employees could result in increased legal and other associated costs. In addition, if an attempted organizing effort were successful and we were to enter into a collective bargaining agreement, the terms could negatively affect our costs, efficiency and ability to generate acceptable returns on the affected operations.", "PERMNO": 10812, "SIC": 4213, "TIC": "HTLD"}
