{"cik": "1054721", "company": "BSQUARE CORP /WA", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-19", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors.\nAs discussed under Item 1 of Part I, \u201cBusiness-Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d our actual results could differ materially from those expressed in our forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that\nwe currently deem immaterial, may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows and the trading price of our common stock could be materially adversely affected.\nMicrosoft-Related Risk Factors\nDue to the fact that we provide software and services to customers building devices utilizing Microsoft\u2019s Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems, as well as the fact that a significant portion of our revenue is derived from the sale of Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems, Microsoft has a significant direct and indirect influence on our business. The following Microsoft-related risk factors may negatively impact our business and operating results.\nIf we do not maintain our OEM Distribution Agreements with Microsoft or if Microsoft de-emphasizes or divests itself from these areas of its business, our revenue would decrease and our business would be adversely affected.\nWe have OEM Distribution Agreements (\u201cODAs\u201d) for Software Products for Embedded Systems with Microsoft, which enable us to sell various Microsoft Windows Embedded operating systems to our customers in the United States, Canada, the Caribbean (excluding Cuba), Mexico, the European Union and the European Free Trade Association. These ODAs are effective through June 30, 2016. We have also entered into other ODAs with Microsoft pursuant to which we are licensed to sell Microsoft Windows Mobile operating systems to customers in North America, South America, Central America (excluding Cuba), Japan, Taiwan, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. The ODAs to sell Windows Mobile operating systems are effective through June 30, 2015.\nWe generated $70.2 million and $64.0 million of revenue in 2014 and 2013, respectively, through our sales of Microsoft operating systems and expect this revenue stream to continue in 2015. If any of the ODAs are terminated by Microsoft (which Microsoft can do unilaterally) or not renewed, or if Microsoft decides to no longer invest in or to divest itself from these areas of its business, our software revenue and resulting gross profit could decrease significantly and our operating results would be negatively impacted. Future renewals, if any, could be on less favorable terms, which could also negatively impact our business and operating results.\nMicrosoft can change pricing under the ODAs at any time, and unless we are able to either pass through price increases to our customers or sign our customers to 12-month purchasing commitments, which lowers the price we pay to Microsoft, our revenue, gross profit and operating results would be negatively impacted. Further, Microsoft currently offers a rebate program in conjunction with our ODA activities in which we earn money for achieving certain predefined objectives. If Microsoft were to eliminate or negatively modify the rebate program, our gross profit and operating results would be negatively impacted. We qualified for rebate credits from Microsoft of $1.0 million and $1.2 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively, a portion of which is accounted for as a reduction in cost of sales and a portion as a reduction in marketing expense if and when qualified expenditures are made.\nMicrosoft has audited our records under the ODAs in the past and will likely audit our records again in the future and any negative audit results could result in additional charges and/or the termination of the ODAs.\nThere are provisions in the ODAs that require us to maintain certain internal records and processes for auditing and other reasons. Non-compliance with these and other requirements could result in the termination of the ODAs. Microsoft has concluded audits of our records pertaining to the ODAs in 2009 and 2006, neither of which had material findings. It is possible that future audits could result in charges due to any material findings that are found. The provisions also include terms that may make us contractually liable for payment of royalties to Microsoft in the event that certificates of authenticity are lost, damaged or stolen.\nIf we are invoiced by Microsoft for a pricing adjustments under OVRP arrangements and we are unable to pass through the charge to our customers, our operating results and cash flow would be negatively impacted.\nIn conjunction with our activities under the ODAs with Microsoft, we enter into OEM Volume Royalty Program (\u201cOVRP\u201d) commitments with Microsoft. Under these OVRPs, we are provided with volume pricing on a customer-by-customer basis assuming certain minimum unit volumes are met. The OVRP terms are 12 months. In the event we don\u2019t meet the committed minimum unit volumes, we are obligated to pay the difference between the committed per-unit volume rate and the actual per-unit rate we achieved based upon actual units purchased. The OVRP arrangements do not equate to a minimum purchase commitment but rather the arrangements are a volume pricing arrangement based upon actual volume purchased. In substantially all instances, we have reciprocal agreements with our customers such that we will receive per-unit price adjustments, similar to the amounts we would subsequently owe to Microsoft if such OVRP volumes are not met. While our history with OVRP arrangements has shown that very few result in a price adjustment and, for those that have, we have been able to pass through the price adjustment to our customer, in the event the customer is unwilling or unable to pay us, our operating results and cash flow would be negatively impacted.\nIf we do not maintain our favorable relationship with Microsoft, we will have difficulty marketing and selling our software and services and may not receive developer releases of Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems. As a result, our revenue and operating results could suffer.\nWe maintain a strategic marketing relationship with Microsoft. If our relationship with Microsoft deteriorates for any reason, such as an increased focus by us on customers building devices utilizing non-Microsoft operating systems, our efforts to market and sell our software and services to our customers could be adversely affected and our business could be harmed. Microsoft has significant influence over the development plans and buying decisions of customers utilizing the various Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems. Microsoft provides customer referrals to us. Moreover, Microsoft controls the marketing campaigns related to its operating systems. Microsoft\u2019s marketing activities are important to the continued promotion and market acceptance of Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems and, consequently, to our sale of Windows-based software and services. We must maintain a favorable relationship with Microsoft to continue to participate in joint marketing activities with them, which includes participating in \u201cpartner pavilions\u201d at trade shows, listing our services on Microsoft\u2019s website, and receiving customer referrals. If we are unable to continue our joint marketing efforts with Microsoft, or fail to receive referrals from them, we would be required to devote significant additional resources and incur additional expenses to market our software products and services directly to potential customers. In addition, we depend on Microsoft for developer releases of new versions of, and upgrades to, its Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile software in order to facilitate timely development and delivery of our own software and services. If we are unable to maintain our favorable relationship with Microsoft and no longer continue receiving such new versions and updates, our revenue could decline significantly, and/or our costs could increase significantly, thereby negatively impacting our operating results.\nUnexpected delays or announcement of delays by Microsoft related to product releases of Windows Embedded or Windows Mobile operating systems could adversely affect our revenue and operating results.\nUnexpected delays or announcement of delays in Microsoft\u2019s delivery schedule for new versions of Windows Embedded or Windows Mobile operating systems could cause us to delay our product introductions or impede our ability to sell our products and services and/or to complete customer projects on a timely basis. Such delays or announcements of delays by Microsoft could also cause our customers to delay or cancel their project development activities or product introductions, which could negatively impact our revenue and operating results.\nIf Microsoft adds features to its Windows operating systems or develops products that directly compete with products and services we provide, our revenue and operating results could be negatively impacted.\nAs the developer of Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems, Microsoft could add features which eliminate or reduce our customers\u2019 need for our software and services, or Microsoft could develop standalone products and services that compete with the products and services we provide to our customers. The ability of our customers, or potential customers, to obtain products and services directly from Microsoft that compete with our products and services could negatively impact our revenue and operating results. Even if the standard features of future Microsoft operating system software were more limited than our offerings, a significant number of our customers, and potential customers, might elect to accept more limited functionality in lieu of purchasing additional software from us or delay the purchase of our products and services while they perform a comparison of Microsoft\u2019s competing offerings. Moreover, the resulting competitive pressures could lead to price reductions for our offerings and reduce our revenue and gross profit accordingly and our operating results could be negatively impacted.\nOur business and results of operations would be adversely impacted if Microsoft decided to provide some, or all, of its Windows Embedded or Windows Mobile operating systems which we currently resell, free of charge to customers.\nMicrosoft has recently announced programs to offer certain consumer Windows phone and tablet-based operating systems to customers free of charge, subject to certain limitations. While we do not distribute these operating systems today under our ODA with Microsoft, if Microsoft were to pursue a similar strategy and offer operating systems that we do currently distribute free of charge, our business and results of operations would be adversely impacted.\nMicrosoft will be introducing the Windows 10 operating system software in the near future, and Microsoft\u2019s pricing and support for this new operating system could directly impact our revenue and margins.\nIn January 2015, Microsoft announced a new operating system, Windows 10, but has not indicated when the software will be available to customers. Microsoft indicated that Windows 10 will be delivered as a service which may alter the traditional business model used to sell Microsoft licenses as a software product. As a reseller of Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems, changes Microsoft\u2019s business model may adversely impact our revenue and gross profit and our operating results could be negatively impacted.\nIf the markets for Windows Embedded and/or Windows Mobile operating systems decline, our business and operating results may be materially harmed.\nBecause a significant portion of our revenue to date has been generated by software and services targeted at customers and devices utilizing the various Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems, if the markets for these systems or platforms decline, our business and operating results could be negatively impacted. Market acceptance of Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems will depend on many factors, including:\n\u00b7\nMicrosoft\u2019s development and support of various Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile markets. As the developer and primary promoter of several versions of operating systems aimed at Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile markets, if Microsoft were to decide to discontinue or lessen its support of these operating systems and platforms, potential customers could select competing operating systems, which could reduce the demand for our Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile related software products and engineering services, from which a significant portion of our revenue is generated today;\n\u00b7\nThe ability of the Microsoft Windows Embedded and/or Windows Mobile operating systems to compete against existing and emerging operating systems for the smart connected systems market, including: iOS from Apple, Inc., VxWorks and Linux from WindRiver Systems Inc.; Android from Google Inc.; QNX; Blackberry from Research In Motion Limited (\u201cRIM\u201d); and other proprietary operating systems. Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems may be unsuccessful in capturing a significant share of the smart connected systems market, or in maintaining its market share;\n\u00b7\nThe acceptance by customers of the mix of features and functions offered by Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems; and\n\u00b7\nThe willingness of software developers to continue to develop and expand the applications running on Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems. To the extent that software developers write applications for competing operating systems that are more attractive to users than those available on Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems, this could cause potential customers to select competing operating systems.\nMyFord Touch-Related Risk Factors\nIf we do not obtain additional work on the MyFord Touch program, our future revenue and gross profit would decrease and our operating results would be adversely affected.\nWe began working on the MyFord Touch infotainment project with Ford in the second quarter of 2008 and continue to work on the program. Since inception of the program through December 31, 2011, our contractual relationship was with Ford. Effective January 1, 2012, our contractual relationship for the MyFord Touch program shifted from Ford to Microsoft, as Microsoft has become the primary vendor to Ford for this program. In 2014 the relationship added Elektrobit Automotive. In December 2014, Ford introduced Sync 3, the next generation MyFord Touch program that is scheduled to be deployed on cars in 2016 and will be based on QNX software from Blackberry instead of software from Microsoft.\nRevenue from the MyFord Touch program comprised $2.8 million, or 3%, of our total revenue in 2014, and $4.5 million, or 5%, of our total revenue in 2013. We currently expect this project work to continue in 2015 but expect revenue from the MyFord Touch program to be lower, albeit still significant in 2015, than it was in 2013 due to the lower level of personnel resources utilized on the program. Our statements of work with Microsoft and Ford currently run through June 30, 2015, and with Elektrobit through December 31, 2015. While we expect to be actively involved in current generation MyFord Touch projects with Microsoft, Ford and Elektrobit through 2015 and beyond, we expect our role on MyFord Touch will be scaled back or eliminated because of the transition to QNX software for the next generation Sync 3 and our revenue and resulting gross profit will decline accordingly.\nGeneral Business-Related Risk Factors\nOur marketplace is extremely competitive, which may result in price reductions, lower gross profit margins and loss of market share.\nThe market for device software and services is extremely competitive. We face competition from the following:\n\u00b7\nOur current and potential customers\u2019 internal research and development departments, which may seek to develop their own software solutions which compete with our proprietary software products and engineering services;\n\u00b7\nEngineering service firms, including off-shore development companies, such as Adeneo, SymphonyTeleca and Wipro;\n\u00b7\nODMs, particularly those in Taiwan and China, which have added or are adding software development capabilities to their offerings;\n\u00b7\nContract manufacturers which have added or are adding software development capabilities to their offerings;\n\u00b7\nMobile and embedded test automation providers including Perfecto Mobile, mVerify, JAMO Solutions, SmartBear Software (AutomatedQA), TestPlant (eggPlant) and Keynote. In this market we also compete against customers\u2019 internally created tools and against manual testing;\n\u00b7\nMicrosoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating system distributors such as Arrow Electronics, Inc. Avnet, Inc. and Synnex Corporation in Taiwan;\n\u00b7\nMarketing agencies and specialized vendors who provide mobile application services; and\n\u00b7\nWe will encounter increasing competition in the growing Internet of Things market from a number of additional software and service providers as we expand our focus on this market in 2015 and beyond.\nSome of our competitors focus on only one aspect of our business or offer complementary products which can be integrated with our products. As we develop and bring to market new software products and service offerings, we may begin competing with companies with which we have not previously competed. Further, as we expand the geographic markets into which we sell our software solutions and related services, or increase our penetration therein, we may expect to increasingly compete with companies with which we have not previously competed. It is also possible that new competitors will enter the market or that our competitors will form alliances, including alliances with Microsoft, that may enable them to rapidly increase their market share. Microsoft has not agreed to any exclusive arrangement with us, nor has it agreed not to compete with us. Microsoft may decide to bring more of the core embedded development services and expertise that we provide in-house, possibly resulting in reduced software and service revenue opportunities for us. The barrier to entering the market as a provider of Microsoft-based smart connected system software and services is low. In addition, Microsoft has created marketing programs to encourage systems integrators to work on Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating system software and services. These systems integrators are given substantially the same access by Microsoft to the Microsoft technology as we are. New competitors may have lower overhead than we do and may be able to undercut our pricing. We expect that competition will increase as other established and emerging companies enter the connected device market, and as new products and technologies are introduced.\nManagement turnover creates uncertainties and could harm our business.\nWe had significant changes in executive leadership during 2013 and 2014 and more could occur. Jerry D. Chase was appointed as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company in February 2014. Mr. Chase joined our Board of Directors in July 2013 and had served as our interim Chief Executive Officer since September 23, 2013, after Brian Crowley stepped down as President and Chief Executive Officer and from the Board of Directors. In October 2013, John Traynor, Senior Vice President, Products left the company as part of our restructuring. In addition, Mike Stipe, Senior Vice President, Worldwide Sales and Marketing departed in December 2013. Mark D. Whiteside has taken on the role of Vice President, Solutions and Scott B. Caldwell has taken on the role as Vice President, Worldwide OEM Sales. Scott Mahan resigned as Chief Financial Officer in August 2014 and was replaced by Martin L. Heimbigner in November 2014.\nChanges to strategic or operating goals, which can often times occur with the appointment of new executives, can create uncertainty, may negatively impact our ability to execute quickly and effectively, and may ultimately be unsuccessful. In addition, executive leadership transition periods are often difficult as the new executives gain detailed knowledge of our operations, and friction can result from changes in strategy and management style. Management turnover inherently causes some loss of institutional knowledge, which can negatively affect strategy and execution. Until we integrate new personnel, and unless they are able to succeed in their positions, we may be unable to successfully manage and grow our business, and our financial condition and profitability may suffer.\nFurther, to the extent we experience additional management turnover, competition for top management is high and it may take months to find a candidate that meets our requirements. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified management personnel, our business could suffer.\nOur ability to maintain or grow our proprietary software revenue is contingent on our ability to bring to market competitive, unique offerings that keep pace with technological changes and needs. If we are not successful in doing so, our business would be negatively impacted.\nProprietary software product revenue provides us with much higher gross profit margins than we typically receive from third-party software products and our engineering service offerings and provide other advantages as well. Increasing the number and amount of proprietary products we sell is an important part of our growth strategy. Our ability to maintain and increase the revenue contribution from proprietary software products is contingent on our ability to enhance the features and functionality of our current proprietary products as well as to devise, develop and introduce new products. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or expand the number of proprietary products that we sell, and our failure to do so could negatively impact revenue and our operating results.\nWe may experience delays in our efforts to develop new products and services, and these delays could cause us to miss market opportunities which could negatively impact our revenue and operating results.\nThe market for our software and services evolves rapidly. As a result, the life cycles of our products and services are difficult to estimate. To be successful, we believe we must continue to enhance our current offerings and provide new software and service offerings with attractive features, prices and terms that appeal to our customers. We have experienced delays in new software and service offering introductions in the past and may do so again in the future. Our revenue and operating results may be negatively impacted if we delay releases of new products, product enhancements and/or new services offerings, or if we fail to accurately anticipate our customers\u2019 needs or technical trends and are unable to introduce new products and service offerings into the market successfully. In addition, our customers may defer or forego purchases of our products and/or services if we, Microsoft, our competitors or major hardware, systems or software vendors introduce or announce new products.\nOur future success depends upon our customers\u2019 ability to successfully sell their products incorporating our technology, and to continue buying our services.\nEven if a customer selects us to provide software and services, the customer may not ultimately market and sell its product successfully. A cancellation or change in plans by a customer, whether from lack of market acceptance of its products or otherwise, could cause us to lose revenue that we had anticipated and our revenue and operating results would suffer. Also, our revenue and operating results could suffer if a significant customer reduces or delays orders during our sales cycle or chooses not to release products that contain our technology.\nIf the market for smart, connected systems evolves based on technologies that we do not support, our revenue may not grow as anticipated, if at all, and our business would be harmed.\nThe technologies used in smart, connected systems change very rapidly and it is often difficult to foresee and predict which application processors, operating systems, connectivity, testing and application development technologies will gain a foothold in device development. As a smaller company we can invest our resources in a limited number of technologies and as such must make forward investments in developing products and capabilities to support the technologies that we choose. If we make investments in technologies that do not gain traction in device development, our profit potential is uncertain and our revenue may not develop as anticipated. We are dependent upon the broad acceptance and adoption by businesses and consumers of a wide variety of device technologies, which will depend on many factors, including:\n\u00b7\nThe development of content and applications for smart, connected systems;\n\u00b7\nThe evolution of industry standards or the necessary infrastructure that facilitate the distribution of content over the internet to these systems via wired and wireless telecommunications systems, satellite or cable; and\n\u00b7\nThe amount of discretionary funds companies and individuals have to spend for the latest technologies.\nDataV, our new proprietary actionable data solution for the Internet of Things ( IoT) market may not gain traction with potential customers.\nDuring 2014 we were developing our DataV proprietary software product, which is an actionable data solution for the Internet of Things (IoT) market. As a new product, DataV may gain customer traction in 2015 more slowly than anticipated and our profit potential from this new product is uncertain. We expect to continue to make investments in the development of DataV, and this will increase our operating expenses. We cannot assure you that there will be sufficient, or any, corresponding increases in revenue generated by sales of DataV, or if it will achieve customer adoption quickly, or at all.\nMobileV, our new software product designed to address the needs of OEMs who are developing highly ruggedized and durable mobile computing products may not gain traction with potential customers.\nDuring 2014, we began selling MobileV a complete hardware and software reference solution based on Intel\u00ae architecture and Microsoft Windows\u00ae Embedded 8.1 that combines board reference designs from Aava Mobile, along with our proprietary software to address the needs of OEMs who are developing highly ruggedized and durable mobile computing products. Our sales of this new product may gain customer traction more slowly than anticipated, or not at all, and our profit potential from this new product is uncertain.\nThe success and profitability of our service offerings are contingent on our ability to differentiate these offerings adequately in the marketplace, which is, in turn, contingent on our ability to retain our engineering personnel and defend our billing rate structure against those of our competitors, including those using significant lower-cost offshore resources. If we are unable to do so successfully, our business could be harmed.\nWe are a leader in providing engineering services to customers developing smart devices. Our market differentiation is created through several factors, including our experience with a variety of smart connected system platforms and applications. Our\ndifferentiation is contingent, in part, on our ability to attract and retain employees with this expertise, a significant portion of which are currently based in the United States. To the extent we are unable to retain critical engineering services talent and/or our competition is able to deliver the same services by using significant lower-cost offshore resources, our service revenue and operating results could be negatively impacted.\nThe success and profitability of our service engagements are contingent upon our ability to scope and bid engagements and deliver our services profitably. If we are unable to do so, our service revenue service gross profit margin and operating results could be negatively impacted.\nVarious factors may cause the total cost of service projects to exceed the original estimate provided to the customer or the contractual maximum in the case of fixed price contracts, including specification changes, customer deliverable delays, inadequate scoping and inefficient service delivery. If we are unable to adequately scope, bid and deliver on service engagements successfully, our service revenue, service gross margin and operating results could be negatively impacted. In addition, depending on the cause of an overrun for a given customer and project, we may also decide to provide pricing concessions to that customer which could negatively impact our service revenue, service gross profit and operating results.\nWe periodically enter into engineering service agreements in which we agree to perform our engineering service work for lower up-front fees, or for no fees, in exchange for future royalties or per unit fees. There is no guarantee that these arrangements will produce the strategic or economic returns as anticipated.\nWe have entered into contracts that involve reducing or eliminating up-front engineering service fees in return for a per-device/chip royalty or fee that is earned as devices or chips are shipped by our customers, and we may enter into more such agreements in the future. Because we are delaying revenue past the point where our services are performed, there is a risk that our customers may cancel their projects or that their devices or chips may not be successful in the market, which could negatively impact our revenue and operating results.\nCooperation and support from silicon vendors is critical for the success of our products and related services that are developed for their particular silicon architecture. Such cooperation cannot be assured.\nWe have developed, and continue to develop, software and service offerings based on certain silicon architectures. Due to the nature of the industry we serve and the products we develop, it is necessary for us to make certain assumptions regarding which silicon vendors will be successful in the various markets we serve and upon which we are making investments. It is therefore important that there is ongoing support from the SVs in the marketplace for these silicon architectures. There can be no assurance that TI, Qualcomm, Freescale, Intel or any of the other SVs will continue to pursue and support the markets that we have been targeting. If the SVs do not support our efforts going forward, our revenue and operating results could be negatively impacted.\nThe long sales cycle of our products and services makes our revenue susceptible to fluctuations.\nOur sales cycle is can run three to twelve months because the expense and complexity of the software and service offerings we sell generally require a lengthy customer approval process and may be subject to a number of significant risks over which we have little or no control, including:\n\u00b7\nCustomers\u2019 budgetary constraints and internal acceptance review procedures;\n\u00b7\nThe approval cycles for our customers may be longer due to economic uncertainties;\n\u00b7\nThe timing of budget cycles; and\n\u00b7\nThe timing of customers\u2019 competitive evaluation processes.\nIn addition, to successfully sell our software and engineering service offerings, we must frequently educate our potential customers about the full benefits of our software and services, which can require significant time. If our sales cycle further lengthens unexpectedly, it could adversely affect the timing of our revenue, which could cause our quarterly results to fluctuate.\nErosion of the financial condition of our customers could adversely affect our business.\nOur business could be adversely affected if the financial condition of our customers erodes because such erosion could reduce demand from those customers for our software and engineering services. This could also cause them to terminate their relationships with us, and/or could increase the risk that such customers default on their payment obligations to us. Additionally, while we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate, economic trends may cause more companies to default or cease operations, in which case our allowances may not cover actual losses, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur business and operations would be adversely impacted in the event of a failure or interruption of our information technology infrastructure.\nThe proper functioning of our information technology infrastructure is critical to the efficient operation and management of our business. Our technology infrastructure is vulnerable to cyber-attacks, computer viruses, worms and other malicious software programs, physical and electronic break-ins, sabotage and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems. We believe that we have adopted appropriate measures to mitigate potential risks to our technology infrastructure and our operations from these information technology-related and other potential disruptions. However, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of such disruptions, we could potentially be subject to downtimes, operational delays, other detrimental impacts on our operations or ability to provide products and services to our customers, the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks, financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability, and/or damage to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, competitive position, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may be subject to product liability claims that could result in significant costs.\nOur software license and service agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims. It is possible, however, that these provisions may be ineffective under the laws of certain jurisdictions or that our customers may not agree to these limitations. Although we have not experienced any product liability claims to date, the sale and support of our products and services may be subject to such claims in the future. There is a risk that any such claims or liabilities may exceed, or fall outside, the scope of our insurance coverage, and we may be unable to retain adequate liability insurance in the future. A product liability claim brought against us, whether successful or not, could negatively impact our business and operating results.\nOur business and results of operations would be adversely impacted in the event that we incur business losses that are not covered by or exceed our existing business insurance coverage.\nWe are insured against certain business risks and liabilities under our corporate insurance policies. However to the extent that we incur losses in connection with our business that are not covered by our existing insurance policies or that exceed our existing policy coverage, our business and results of operations would be adversely impacted.\nNegative business conditions, changes in useful lives, and other factors may negatively affect the carrying value of the intangible assets and goodwill we have acquired.\nIn the third quarter of 2011, we acquired MPC Data, Ltd. including certain intangible assets with a carrying value of $660,000 and goodwill of $3.7 million as of December 31, 2014. Although we expect to generate cash from the intangible assets in the future, and do not foresee any impairment of our goodwill, it is possible that we may be required to reassess the carrying value of these assets in the future if certain negative business conditions occur such as negative results of our business associated with our intangible assets or a low stock price. Any reduction in the carrying value of these intangible assets or goodwill would result in an impairment charge that would negatively impact our operating results. Further, business conditions and other factors may also require us to reassess the useful lives associated with intangible assets.\nPast acquisitions have proven difficult to integrate, and recent or future acquisitions, if any, could disrupt our business, dilute shareholder value and negatively affect our operating results.\nWe have acquired the technologies, assets and/or operations of other companies in the past and may acquire or make investments in companies, products, services and technologies in the future as part of our growth strategy. If we fail to properly evaluate, integrate and execute on our acquisitions and investments, our business and prospects may be seriously harmed. To successfully complete an acquisition, we must properly evaluate the technology, market and management team, accurately forecast the financial impact of the transaction, including accounting charges and transaction expenses, integrate and retain personnel, combine potentially different corporate cultures and effectively integrate products and research and development, sales, marketing and support operations. If we fail to do any of these, we may suffer losses and impair relationships with our employees, customers and strategic partners. Additionally, management may be distracted from day-to-day operations. We also may be unable to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies, which are especially critical in light of requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and other corporate governance requirements, and significant demands may be placed on our management and our operations, information services and financial, legal and marketing resources. Finally, acquired businesses sometimes result in unexpected liabilities and contingencies, which may involve compliance with foreign laws, payment of taxes, labor negotiations or other unknown costs and expenses, which could be significant.\nWe may not be able to raise additional capital if required to support our business.\nIf we need to raise additional operating capital, we may find that our access to equity and debt capital markets is limited or blocked entirely. In the past, our stock has traded at low volumes and overall investor confidence in the stock market could falter. This\ncould make it difficult or impossible to sell additional shares on the public markets. In addition, it may be difficult and costly to obtain debt financing and we may be unable to borrow additional funds at acceptable cost, or at all, should the need arise. If we are unable to raise capital as necessary, it may adversely affect our ability to invest in products or fund operations, which would materially harm our business and negatively affect operating results.\nTaxing jurisdictions in the United States are becoming more aggressive with tax legislation and tax collection, particularly states facing significant budget deficits, which could expose us to additional tax liability that we have not been subject to in the past.\nWe make sales in many jurisdictions across the United States, most of which we do not have nexus in and, therefore, are not subject to sales, franchise, income and other state and local taxes. Particularly in light of state revenue deficits, taxing jurisdictions have become more aggressive in defining nexus, among other things, which could result in us achieving nexus, or potentially achieving nexus in significantly more tax jurisdictions. If this occurs and unless we are able to pass through this cost to our customers, our tax expense will increase which will negatively affect our results of operations. Further, because state and local tax laws are becoming increasingly complex, our cost to monitor our state and local tax compliance will increase which will negatively affect our results of operations. Additionally, there can be no assurance that we do not currently have unknown tax exposure in a state or local tax jurisdiction because of recent tax law changes which we are unaware of and the resulting liability could be significant and would negatively affect our results of operations.\nThere may be restrictions on the use of our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards due to a tax law \u201cownership change.\u201d\nSection 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code restricts the ability of a corporation that undergoes an ownership change to use net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. At December 31, 2014, we had approximately $59.7 million of federal and $3.4 million of state net operating loss carryforwards and $2.7 million of tax credit carryforwards. Under the applicable tax rules, an ownership change occurs if greater than five percent shareholders of an issuer\u2019s outstanding common stock collectively increase their ownership percentage by more than 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. We have performed analyses of possible ownership changes which included consideration of a third-party study, and do not believe that an ownership change as defined by Section 382 has occurred. However, if a tax law ownership change has occurred of which we are not aware, or if a tax law ownership change occurs in the future, we may have to adjust the valuation of our deferred tax assets, and could be at risk of having to pay income taxes notwithstanding the existence of our sizable carryforwards. Further, to the extent that we have utilized our carryforwards from prior years, the existence of a previous tax law ownership change that we did not account for could result in liability for back taxes, interest, and penalties. If we are unable to utilize our carryforwards and/or if we previously utilized carryforwards to which we were not entitled, it would negatively impact our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIntellectual Property-Related Risk Factors\nOur software and service offerings could infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which could expose us to additional costs and litigation and could adversely affect our ability to sell our products and services or cause shipment delays or stoppages.\nIt is difficult to determine whether our software and engineering services infringe third-party intellectual property rights, particularly in a rapidly evolving technological environment in which technologies often overlap and where there may be numerous patent applications pending, many of which are confidential when filed. If we were to discover that one of our software or service offerings, or a product based on one of our reference designs, violated a third-party\u2019s proprietary rights, we may not be able to obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, to continue offering that product or service. Similarly, third parties may claim that our current or future software products and services infringe their proprietary rights, regardless of whether such claims have merit. Any such claims could increase our costs and negatively impact our business and operating results. In certain cases, we have been unable to obtain indemnification against claims that third-party technology incorporated into our software products and services infringe the proprietary rights of others. However, any indemnification we do obtain may be limited in scope or amount. Even if we receive broad third-party indemnification, these entities may not have the financial capability to indemnify us in the event of infringement. In addition, in some circumstances we are required to indemnify our customers for claims made against them that are based on our software products or services. There can be no assurance that infringement or invalidity claims related to the software products and services we provide, or arising from the incorporation by us of third-party technology, and claims for indemnification from our customers resulting from such claims, will not be asserted or prosecuted against us. Some of our competitors have, or are affiliated, with companies with substantially greater resources than we have, and these competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex intellectual property litigation to a greater degree and for longer periods of time than we could. In addition, we expect that software developers will be increasingly subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in the software industry grows, and as the functionality of products in different industry segments increasingly overlap. Such claims, even if not meritorious, could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources in addition to potential product redevelopment costs and delays. Furthermore, if we were unsuccessful in resolving a patent or other intellectual property infringement action claim against us, we may be prohibited from developing or commercializing certain of our technologies and products, or\ndelivering services based on the infringing technology, unless we obtain a license from the holder of the patent or other intellectual property rights. There can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain any such license on commercially favorable terms, or at all. If such license is not obtained, we would be required to cease these related business operations, which could negatively impact our business, revenue and operating results.\nIf we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, competitors may be able to use our technology or trademarks, which could weaken our competitive position, reduce our revenue and increase our costs.\nIf we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property, our competitive position could be weakened and our revenue and operating results adversely affected. We rely primarily on confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions as well as a combination of patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, to protect our intellectual property. These laws and procedures provide only limited protection. It is possible that another party could obtain patents that block our use of some, or all, of our software and services. If that occurred, we would need to obtain a license from the patent holder or design around those patents. The patent holder may or may not choose to make a license available to us at all, or on acceptable terms. Similarly, it may not be possible to design around a blocking patent. In general, there can be no assurance that our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights through patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark laws will be effective to prevent misappropriation of our technology, or to prevent the development and design by others of products or technologies similar to or competitive with those developed by us.\nWe frequently license the source code of our software products and the source code results of our services to customers. There can be no assurance that customers with access to our source code will comply with the license terms or that we will discover any violations of the license terms or, in the event of discovery of violations, that we will be able to successfully enforce the license terms and/or recover the economic value lost from such violations. To license some of our software products, we rely in part on \u201cshrink-wrap\u201d and \u201cclick wrap\u201d licenses that are not signed by the end user and, therefore, may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions. As with other software, our software products are susceptible to unauthorized copying and uses that may go undetected, and policing such unauthorized use is difficult. A significant portion of our marks include the word \u201cBSQUARE.\u201d Other companies use forms of \u201cBSQUARE\u201d in their marks alone, or in combination with other words, and we cannot prevent all such third-party uses. We license certain trademark rights to third parties. Such licensees may not abide by our compliance and quality control guidelines with respect to such trademark rights. Any of these outcomes could negatively impact our brand, dilute its recognition in the marketplace, or confuse potential customers, all of which could harm our business.\nThe computer software market is characterized by frequent and substantial intellectual property litigation, which is often complex and expensive, and involves a significant diversion of resources and uncertainty of outcome. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property or to defend against a claim of infringement or invalidity. Litigation could result in substantial costs and the diversion of resources and could negatively impact our business and operating results.\nOur software or hardware products or the third-party hardware or software integrated with our products or delivered as part of our service offerings may suffer from defects or errors that could impair our ability to sell our products and services.\nSoftware and hardware components as complex as those needed for smart connected systems frequently contain errors or defects, especially when first introduced or when new versions are released. We have had to delay commercial release of certain versions of our products until problems were corrected and, in some cases, have provided product enhancements to correct errors in released products. Some of our contracts require us to repair or replace products that fail to work. To the extent that we repair or replace products our expenses may increase. In addition, it is possible that by the time defects are fixed, the market opportunity may decline which may result in lost revenue. Moreover, to the extent that we provide increasingly comprehensive products and services, particularly those focused on hardware, and rely on third-party manufacturers and suppliers to manufacture these products, we will be dependent on the ability of third-party manufacturers to correct, identify and prevent manufacturing errors. Errors that are discovered after commercial release could result in loss of revenue or delay in market acceptance, diversion of development resources, damage to our reputation and increased service and warranty costs, all of which could negatively impact our business and operating results.\nIf we are unable to license key software from third parties, our business could be harmed.\nWe sometimes integrate third-party software with our proprietary software and engineering service offerings or sell such third-party software offerings on a standalone basis (e.g. Microsoft Windows Embedded operating systems under our ODA with Microsoft). If our relationships with these third-party software vendors were to deteriorate, or be eliminated in their entirety, we might be unable to obtain licenses on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. In the event that we are unable to obtain these third-party software offerings, we would be required to develop this technology internally, assuming it was economically or technically feasible, or seek similar software offerings from other third parties assuming there were competing offerings in the marketplace, which could delay or limit our ability to introduce enhancements or new products, or to continue to sell existing products and engineering services, thereby negatively impacting our revenue and operating results.\nGovernance-Related Risk Factors\nIt might be difficult for a third-party to acquire us even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders.\nCertain provisions of our articles of incorporation, bylaws and Washington law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in the control of us or a change in our management, even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders. Our Board of Directors has the authority under our amended and restated articles of incorporation to issue preferred stock with rights superior to the rights of the holders of common stock. As a result, preferred stock could be issued quickly and easily with terms calculated to delay or prevent a change in control of our company or make removal of our management more difficult. In addition, our Board of Directors is divided into three classes. The directors in each class serve for three-year terms, one class being elected each year by our shareholders. This system of electing and removing directors may discourage a third party from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company because it generally makes it more difficult for shareholders to replace a majority of our directors. In addition, Chapter 19 of the Washington Business Corporation Act generally prohibits a \u201ctarget corporation\u201d from engaging in certain significant business transactions with a defined \u201cacquiring person\u201d for a period of five years after the acquisition, unless the transaction or acquisition of shares is approved by a majority of the members of the target corporation\u2019s Board of Directors prior to the time of acquisition. This provision may have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change in control of our company. The existence of these anti-takeover provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.\nInternational Operations-Related Risk Factors\nOur international operations expose us to greater intellectual property, management, collections, regulatory and other risks.\nCustomers outside of North America generated 10% of our total revenue in 2014 and 13% in 2013. We currently have sizable operations outside of North America in Taiwan and the United Kingdom and also have a minor sales and support presence in Japan. In 2013, we closed our operations in Korea, China and Germany. Our international activities and operations expose us to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u00b7\nGreater difficulty in protecting intellectual property due to less stringent foreign intellectual property laws and enforcement policies;\n\u00b7\nLonger collection cycles than we typically experience in North America;\n\u00b7\nUnfavorable changes in regulatory practices and tariffs;\n\u00b7\nCompliance with complex regulatory regimes or restrictions on import and export of our goods and services;\n\u00b7\nComplex and/or adverse tax laws and/or changes thereto. Additionally, we may be subject to income, withholding and other taxes for which we may realize no current benefit despite the existence of significant net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in the U.S.;\n\u00b7\nLoss or reduction of withholding tax exemptions;\n\u00b7\nThe impact of fluctuating exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies;\n\u00b7\nGeneral economic and political conditions in international markets which may differ from those in the U.S.;\n\u00b7\nIncreased exposure to potential liability under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;\n\u00b7\nAdded cost and administrative burden associated with creating and operating business structures in other jurisdictions;\n\u00b7\nPotential labor costs and risks associated with employees and labor laws in other geographies; and\n\u00b7\nThe inherent risks of working in a certain highly regulated and/or controlled economies where relationships between company management and government officials is critical to timely processing of approvals required to conduct business.\nThese risks could have a material adverse effect on the financial and managerial resources required to operate our foreign offices, as well as on our future international revenue, which could negatively impact our business and operating results.\nAs our customers seek more cost-effective locations to develop and manufacture their products, particularly overseas locations, our ability to continue to sell these customers our software products and services could be limited, which could negatively impact our revenue and operating results.\nDue to competitive and other pressures, some of our customers have moved, and others may seek to move, the development and manufacturing of their smart, connected systems to overseas locations, which may limit our ability to sell these customers our software and services. As an example, under our ODA with Microsoft, we are currently only able to sell Microsoft Windows Embedded operating systems to our customers in the United States, Canada, the Caribbean (excluding Cuba), Mexico, the European Union and the European Free Trade Association. If our customers, or potential customers, move their manufacturing overseas we may be less competitive, which could negatively impact our revenue and operating results.", "PERMNO": 87302, "SIC": 5045, "TIC": "BSQR"}
