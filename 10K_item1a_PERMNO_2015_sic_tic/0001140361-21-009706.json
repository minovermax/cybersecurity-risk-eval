Before you make a decision to buy our securities, in addition to the risks and uncertainties discussed above under \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d you should carefully consider the specific risks set forth herein. If any of these risks actually occur, it may materially harm our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. As a result, the market price of our securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. Additionally, the risks and uncertainties described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are not the only risks and uncertainties that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may become material and adversely affect our business.\nRisks Related to Business and Industry\nWe have a history of operating losses and may not achieve or sustain profitability in the future.\nLegacy Billtrust was incorporated in 2001 and has mostly experienced net losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception. Legacy Billtrust generated net losses of $17.0 million, $22.8 million and $18.2 million for fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, Legacy Billtrust had an accumulated deficit of $171.5 million. While Legacy Billtrust has experienced significant revenue growth in recent periods, we are not certain whether or when we will obtain a high enough volume of revenue to sustain or increase our growth or achieve or maintain profitability in the future. We also expect our costs and expenses to increase in future periods, which could negatively affect our future operating results if our revenue does not increase. In particular, we intend to continue to expend significant funds to further develop our platform, including introducing new products and functionality, and to expand our marketing programs and sales teams to drive increased adoption by current customers and new customer adoption, and expand channel sales and adoption and usage of our Business Payments Network, or BPN. Our operating results each quarter are also impacted by the mix of our revenue generated from our different revenue sources, which include subscription fees, transaction fees and service fees. Changes in our revenue mix from quarter to quarter will impact our margins, and we may not be able to grow our higher margin subscription and payments based revenue adequately to achieve or sustain profitability. We will also face increased compliance and security costs associated with growth, the expansion of our customer base, and being a public company. Our efforts to grow our business may be costlier than we expect, and we may not be able to increase our revenue enough to offset our increased operating expenses. We may incur significant losses in the future for several reasons, including the other risks described herein, and unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays, and other unknown events. If we are unable to achieve and sustain profitability, the value of our business and the value of our Common Stock and Class 2 Common Stock (as defined below) may significantly decrease.\nOur recent rapid growth, including growth in our volume of payments and transactions on the BPN, may not be indicative of our future growth, and if we continue to grow rapidly, we may not be able to manage our growth effectively. Our rapid growth also makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and may increase the risk that we will not be successful.\nLegacy Billtrust\u2019s revenue was $145.7 million, $136.5 million and $120.5 million for fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Even if our revenue continues to increase, our growth rate may decline in the future as a result of a variety of factors, including the increasing scale of our business. Overall growth of our revenue depends on a number of factors, including our ability to:\n\u2022\nattract new customers and increase sales to our existing customers;\n\u2022\nincrease adoption and usage of our products and services, including the BPN;\n\u2022\nmanage the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and operations;\n\u2022\nexpand the functionality and scope of the products we offer;\n\u2022\nincrease the rates at which customers subscribe to and continue to use our products;\n\u2022\nincrease the volume of payments processed;\n\u2022\nincrease awareness of our brand and successfully compete with other companies;\n\u2022\nexpand into markets outside the United States;\n\u2022\nprovide our customers with high-quality customer support that meets their needs; and\n\u2022\nsuccessfully identify and acquire or invest in businesses, products, or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our products and services.\nWe may not successfully accomplish any of these objectives, which makes it difficult for us to forecast our future operating results. If the assumptions that we use to plan our business are incorrect or change in reaction to changes in our markets, or if we are unable to maintain consistent revenue or revenue growth, our stock price could be volatile, and it may be difficult to achieve and maintain profitability. Our revenue from any prior quarterly or annual periods should not be relied upon as an indication of our future revenue or revenue growth or growth in our volume of payments processed.\nIn addition, we expect to continue to expend substantial financial and other resources on:\n\u2022\nsales, marketing and customer success, including an expansion of our sales organization and new customer success initiatives;\n\u2022\nour technology infrastructure, including systems architecture, scalability, availability, performance, and security;\n\u2022\nproduct development, including investments in our product development team and the development of new products and new functionality;\n\u2022\nexpanding into markets outside the United States;\n\u2022\nacquisitions or strategic investments;\n\u2022\nregulatory compliance and risk management; and\n\u2022\ngeneral administration, including increased legal and accounting expenses associated with being a public company.\nThese investments may not result in increased revenue growth in our business. If we are unable to increase our revenue at a rate sufficient to offset the expected increase in our costs, our business, financial position and operating results will be harmed, and we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability over the long term.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has materially impacted the United States and global economies, and could have a material adverse impact on our employees, customers and partners, which could adversely and materially impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe World Health Organization has declared the outbreak of the novel coronavirus COVID-19 a pandemic and public health emergency of international concern. In March 2020, the President of the United States declared a State of National Emergency due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, many jurisdictions in the United States have limited social mobility and gathering. Many business establishments have closed due to restrictions imposed by the government and many governmental authorities have closed or limited the number of persons who can attend or use most public establishments, including schools, restaurants and shopping malls. Our customer invoices processed declined in March 2020 and April 2020 from prior year levels before recovering. Our customers have been, and may continue to be, negatively impacted by the shelter-in-place and other similar state and local orders, the closure of manufacturing sites and country borders, and the increase in unemployment. These conditions will continue to have negative implications on demand for goods, the supply chain, production of goods and transportation. As the COVID-19 pandemic persists, governments (at national, state and local levels), companies and other authorities may continue to implement restrictions or policies that could adversely impact business to business spending, consumer spending, global capital markets, the global economy and our stock price. Although we have not experienced significant business disruptions thus far from the COVID-19 pandemic, we saw our transaction fees, including those in the print segment, decrease year over year for certain customers. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may continue to experience an adverse impact to our business as a result of its global economic impact.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused us to modify our business practices (including employee travel and cancellation of physical participation in meetings, events and conferences), we temporarily reduced employee salaries, almost all of our employees are currently working remotely, and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners, and business. Our modified business practices, and any further actions we may take, may adversely impact our employees and employee productivity. The COVID-19 pandemic may also adversely impact the operations of our customers and partners. This direct impact of the virus, and the disruption on our employees and operations, may negatively impact both our ability to meet customer demand and our revenue and margins. We may experience delays or changes in customer demand, particularly if customer funding priorities change.\nBoth the health and economic aspects of the COVID-19 virus are highly fluid and the future course of each is uncertain. For these reasons and other reasons that may come to light if the COVID-19 pandemic and associated protective or preventative measures expand, we may experience a material adverse impact on our business operations, revenues and financial condition as well as some of our underlying business drivers such as customer growth and payment and transaction volumes; however, the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on us and our business operations, revenues and financial condition is highly uncertain and subject to change. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this \u201c-Risks Related to Business and Industry\u201d section.\nIf our security measures are breached or unauthorized access to customer data is otherwise obtained, our platform or products may be perceived as not being secure, customers may reduce the use of or stop using our products and platform and we may incur significant liabilities.\nWe, our customers, our partners and third-party vendors and data centers that we use obtain and process large amounts of sensitive data, including data related to our customers and their transactions, as well as other data of the customers of our customers related to their spending, payments, invoices, billing, and transactions. We face risks, including to our reputation as a trusted brand, in the handling and protection of this data, and these risks will increase as our business continues to expand to include new products and technologies.\nCybersecurity incidents and malicious internet-based activity continue to increase generally, and providers of cloud-based services have frequently been targeted by such attacks. These cybersecurity challenges, including threats to our own information technology infrastructure or those of our customers or third-party providers, may take a variety of forms ranging from stolen bank accounts, business email compromise, customer or employee fraud or mistake, account takeover, supply chain attacks, check fraud or cybersecurity attacks, which could be initiated by individual or groups of hackers or sophisticated cyber criminals. A cybersecurity incident or breach could result in disclosure of confidential information and intellectual property, or cause production downtimes and compromised data. We have experienced cybersecurity incidents of various scale in the past. For example, in October 2019, Legacy Billtrust experienced a malware attack on its systems that temporarily adversely affected the availability of certain services to certain customers and was eradicated within its network with no evidence of exfiltration of data. We may be unable to anticipate or prevent techniques used in the future to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems because they change frequently and often are not detected until after an incident has occurred. As we increase our customer base and our brand becomes more widely known and recognized, third parties may increasingly seek to compromise our security controls or gain unauthorized access to our customers\u2019 data or our sensitive corporate information.\nWe have administrative, technical, and physical security measures in place, and we have policies and procedures in place to contractually require service providers to whom we disclose data or who access data from us or our partners to implement and maintain reasonable privacy, data protection, and information security measures. However, if our privacy protection, data protection, or information security measures or those of the previously mentioned third parties are inadequate or are breached as a result of third-party action, employee or contractor error, malfeasance, malware, phishing, hacking attacks, system error, software bugs or defects in our products, trickery, process failure or otherwise, and, as a result, there is improper disclosure of, or someone obtains unauthorized access to or exfiltrates funds or sensitive information, including personally identifiable information, on our systems, our service providers\u2019 systems or our partners\u2019 systems, or if we suffer a ransomware or advanced persistent threat attack, or if any of the foregoing is reported or perceived to have occurred, our reputation and business could be damaged. Recent high-profile security breaches and related disclosures of sensitive data by large institutions suggest that the risk of such events is significant, even if privacy, data protection, and information security measures are implemented and enforced. If we experience security breaches and sensitive information is lost or improperly disclosed or threatened to be disclosed, we could incur production downtime and significant costs associated with remediation and the implementation of additional security measures, may incur significant liability and financial loss, and be subject to regulatory scrutiny, investigations, proceedings, lawsuits and penalties.\nIn addition, our financial institution partners conduct regular audits of our cybersecurity program, and if any of them were to conclude that our systems and procedures are insufficiently rigorous, they could terminate their relationships with us, and our financial results and business could be adversely affected. Under our terms of service and our contracts with customers and partners, if there is a breach of sensitive data that we store, we could be liable to the customer or partner for their losses and related expenses. Additionally, if our own confidential business information were improperly disclosed, our business could be materially and adversely affected. A core aspect of our business is the reliability and security of our platform. Any perceived or actual breach of security, regardless of how it occurs or the extent of the breach, could have a significant impact on our reputation as a trusted brand, cause us to lose existing customers or partners, prevent us from obtaining new customers or partners, require us to expend significant funds to remedy problems caused by breaches and implement measures to prevent further breaches, such as forensics and fraud monitoring, cause production downtimes, and expose us to legal risk and potential liability including those resulting from governmental or regulatory investigations and class action litigation. Any actual or perceived security breach at a company providing services to us or our customers could have similar effects. Further, as the current COVID-19 pandemic continues to result in a significant number of people working from home, these cybersecurity risks may be heightened by an increased attack surface across our business and those of our partners and service providers. We have heightened monitoring in the face of such risks, but cannot guarantee that our efforts, or the efforts of those upon whom we rely and partner with, will be successful in preventing any such information security incidents.\nWe cannot assure you that any limitations of liability provisions in our contracts would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from any liabilities or damages with respect to any particular claim relating to a security lapse or breach. While we maintain cybersecurity insurance, our insurance may be insufficient or may not cover all liabilities incurred by such attacks. We also cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be adequate for data handling or data security liabilities actually incurred, that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceeds available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, including our financial condition, operating results and reputation.\nOur quarterly results may fluctuate significantly and may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business.\nOur results of operations and key metrics, such as our revenue, gross profit, net dollar retention and total payment volume may vary significantly in the future and period-to-period comparisons of our operating results and key metrics may not provide a full picture of our performance. Accordingly, the results of any one quarter or year should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Our quarterly financial results and metrics may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, as a result they may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business. These quarterly fluctuations may negatively affect the value of our Common Stock. Factors that may cause these fluctuations include, without limitation:\n\u2022\nour ability to attract new customers;\n\u2022\nthe addition or loss of one or more of our larger customers, including as the result of acquisitions or consolidations;\n\u2022\nthe timing of recognition of revenues, including a significant portion of our revenues that are transaction-based and highly recurring in nature and vary based on the number of invoices processed, payments made and payment volume;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of operating expenses;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic, industry and market conditions, both domestically and internationally, including any economic downturns and adverse impacts resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022\nthe timing of our billing and collections;\n\u2022\ncustomer renewal, expansion, and adoption rates;\n\u2022\nsecurity breaches of, technical difficulties with, or interruptions to the delivery and use of our products and services on our platform;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of completion of professional services engagements;\n\u2022\nincreases or decreases in the number of users for our products, services and platform, or pricing changes upon any renewals of customer agreements;\n\u2022\nchanges in our pricing policies or those of our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe timing and success of new product introductions by us or our competitors or any other change in the competitive dynamics of our industry, including consolidation among competitors, customers or partners;\n\u2022\nextraordinary expenses such as litigation or other dispute-related expenses or settlement payments;\n\u2022\nsales tax and other tax determinations by authorities in the jurisdictions in which we conduct business;\n\u2022\nthe impact of new accounting pronouncements and the adoption thereof;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in stock based compensation expense;\n\u2022\nexpenses in connection with mergers, acquisitions or other strategic transactions;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of expenses related to our expansion to markets outside the United States; and\n\u2022\nthe timing of expenses related to the development or acquisition of technologies or businesses and potential future charges for impairment of goodwill or intangibles from acquired companies.\nFurther, in future periods, our revenue growth could slow or our revenues could decline for a number of reasons, including slowing demand for our products and services, increasing competition, a decrease in the growth of our overall market, or our failure, for any reason, to continue to capitalize on growth opportunities. In addition, our growth rate may slow in the future as our market penetration rates increase. As a result, our revenues, operating results and cash flows may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and revenue growth rates may not be sustainable and may decline in the future, and we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability in future periods, which could harm our business and cause the market price of our Common Stock to decline.\nIf we fail to manage our technical operations infrastructure, our existing customers may experience service outages.\nWe have experienced significant growth in the number of users, transactions and data that our operations infrastructure supports, especially in connection with our BPN services. We seek to maintain sufficient excess capacity in our operations infrastructure to meet the needs of all of our customers, as well as to facilitate the rapid provision of new customer implementations and transaction volume. However, the provision of new hosting infrastructure requires significant lead time. We could experience disruptions, outages and other performance problems. These problems may be caused by a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors, viruses, security attacks, fraud, spikes in customer usage and denial of service issues. In some instances, we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these performance problems within an acceptable period of time. If we do not accurately predict our infrastructure requirements, our customers may experience service outages that may subject us to financial penalties, financial liabilities and customer losses. If our operations infrastructure fails to keep pace with our increased number of users, transactions and data that our operations infrastructure supports, customers may experience delays as we seek to obtain additional capacity, which could adversely affect our revenue as well as our reputation.\nOur risk management efforts may not be effective to prevent fraudulent activities by our customers, employees or other third parties, which could expose us to material financial losses and liability and otherwise harm our business.\nWe offer cloud based billing, invoicing and payment facilitation solutions for a large number of customers. We are responsible for verifying the identity of our customers and their users, and monitoring transactions for fraud. We may be targeted by parties who seek to commit acts of financial fraud using techniques such as stolen identities and bank accounts, compromised business email accounts, employee or insider fraud, account takeover, false applications, and check fraud. We may suffer losses from acts of financial fraud committed by our customers and their users, our employees or third-parties.\nThe techniques used to perpetrate fraud are continually evolving and we may not be able to identify all risks created by new products or functionality. Our risk management policies, procedures, techniques, and processes may not be sufficient to identify all of the risks to which we are exposed, to enable us to prevent or mitigate the risks we have identified, or to identify additional risks to which we may become subject in the future. Furthermore, our risk management policies, procedures, techniques, and processes may contain errors or our employees or agents may commit mistakes or errors in judgment as a result of which we may suffer large financial losses. The software-driven and highly automated nature of our solutions could enable criminals and those committing fraud to steal significant amounts of money accessing our platform. As greater numbers of customers use our platform, our exposure to material risk losses from a single customer, or from a small number of customers, will increase.\nOur current business and anticipated growth will continue to place significant demands on our risk management efforts, and we will need to continue developing and improving our existing risk management infrastructure, policies, procedures, techniques, and processes. As techniques used to perpetrate fraud on our platform evolve, we may need to modify our products or services to mitigate fraud risks. As our business grows and becomes more complex, we may be less able to forecast and carry appropriate reserves in our books for fraud related losses. Further, these types of fraudulent activities on our platform can also expose us to civil and criminal liability, governmental and regulatory sanctions as well as potentially cause us to be in breach of our contractual obligations to our customers and partners.\nWe facilitate the transfer of customer funds daily, and are subject to the risk of errors, which could result in financial losses, damage to our reputation, or loss of trust in our brand, which would harm our business and financial results.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, Legacy Billtrust processed approximately $55 billion in payments on its platform, compared to $44 billion in 2019. Legacy Billtrust has grown rapidly and we seek to continue to grow, and although we maintain a multi-faceted risk management process, our business is always subject to the risk of financial losses as a result of credit losses, fraud, operational errors, software defects, service disruption, employee misconduct, security breaches, or other similar actions or errors. As a provider of invoicing, billing, cash cycle management, and payment solutions, we collect and facilitate the transfers of funds on behalf of our customers that are subject to losses, disruptions, and errors.\nMoreover, our trustworthiness and reputation are fundamental to our business. As a provider of cloud-based software for complex financial operations, the occurrence of any credit losses, operational errors, software defects, service disruption, employee misconduct, security breaches, or other similar actions or errors on our platform could result in financial losses to our business and our customers, loss of trust, damage to our reputation, or termination of our agreements with customers or partners, each of which could result in:\n\u2022\nloss of customers;\n\u2022\nlost or delayed market acceptance and sales of our products and services and decreased use of our platform;\n\u2022\nlegal claims against us including warranty and service level agreement claims;\n\u2022\nregulatory enforcement action;\n\u2022\ndiversion of our resources; or\n\u2022\nincreased insurance costs.\nAlthough we maintain insurance to cover losses resulting from our errors and omissions, there can be no assurance that our insurance will cover all losses or our coverage will be sufficient to cover our losses. If we suffer significant losses or reputational harm as a result, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to attract new customers, the growth of our revenues will be adversely affected.\nTo increase our revenues, we must add new customers, increase transaction volume of existing customers and sell additional products and services to current customers. The expansion of our customer base is critical to our ability to continue the growth of our revenues. If we do not grow our customer base, our revenues will slow in future periods or will start to decline, as a result of customers not renewing.\nIf competitors introduce lower cost and/or differentiated products or services that are perceived to compete with ours, our ability to sell based on factors such as pricing, technology and functionality could be impaired. As a result, we may be unable to attract new customers at rates or on terms that would be favorable or comparable to prior periods, which could have an adverse effect on the growth of our revenues.\nOur business depends substantially on our customers renewing their contracts and subscriptions and purchasing additional subscriptions from us. Any decline in our customer renewals would harm our future operating results.\nIn order for us to maintain or improve our operating results, it is important that our customers renew their subscriptions when the initial contract term expires and add additional authorized users and additional products and services to their subscriptions. Our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions, and there can be no assurance that our customers will renew subscriptions with a similar contract period or with the same or a greater number of authorized users and products and services. Some of our customers have elected not to renew their agreements with us, and we may not be able to accurately predict renewal rates.\nOur renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including our customers\u2019 satisfaction with our products, our services, our customer support, our prices and contract length, the prices of competing solutions, the results of any customer security audit of our platform or any other customer audit of us, mergers and acquisitions affecting our customer base, the effects of global economic conditions or reductions in our customers\u2019 spending levels. Our future success also depends in part on our ability to increase the adoption rate of our products and services for our current customers. If our customers do not renew their subscriptions, renew on less favorable terms or fail to add more authorized users or additional products and services, our revenues may decline, and we may not realize improved operating results from our customer base.\nBecause we recognize subscription revenues over the term of the contract, fluctuations in new sales and customer cancellations may not be immediately reflected in our operating results and may be difficult to discern.\nWe generally recognize subscription revenues from customers ratably over the terms of their contracts. Most of our subscription revenues in any quarter are derived from the recognition of deferred revenue relating to subscriptions entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a decline in new subscriptions or an increase in customer cancellations in any single quarter would likely have only a small impact on our revenues for that quarter. However, such a decline or increase would negatively affect our revenues in future quarters. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our platform, and potential changes in our pricing policies or rate of customer cancellations, may not be fully apparent from our reported results of operations until future periods.\nWe may be unable to adjust our cost structure to reflect the changes in revenues. In addition, a significant majority of our costs are expensed as incurred, while subscription revenues are recognized over the life of the customer agreement. As a result, increased growth in the number of our customers could result in our recognition of more costs than revenues in the earlier periods of the terms of our agreements. Our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenues through additional sales in any period, as revenues from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription term.\nOur business depends, in part, on our partnerships with financial institutions, third party service providers, processing providers and other financial services suppliers. If any of our agreements with such financial institutions, third party service providers, processing providers, or financial services providers are terminated, we could experience service interruptions.\nOur business requires us to enter into contracts and relationships with financial institutions, processors and other financial services suppliers. To grow our business, we will seek to expand our relationships with our financial institution partners, processors and other financial services suppliers, and to partner with additional banks and financial institutions, processors, financial services providers and suppliers. These partners and suppliers have contractual and regulatory requirements and conditions that we must satisfy and continue to comply with in order to continue and grow the relationships. For example, our financial institution partners, processors and financial services suppliers may require us to submit to an exhaustive security audit, given the sensitivity and importance of storing their customer billing and payment data on our platform. If we are unsuccessful in establishing, growing, or maintaining our relationships with partners, our ability to compete in the marketplace or to grow our revenue could be impaired, and our results of operations may suffer.\nWe also depend on banks to process transactions, including Automated Clearing House (\u201cACH\u201d) and network branded third party payment card transactions, for our customers. We have entered into agreements with banks for payment processing and related services. These agreements include significant security, compliance, and operational obligations. If we are not able to comply with those obligations or our agreements with the processing banks or our credit card transaction processor are terminated for any reason, we could experience service interruptions as well as delays and additional expenses in arranging new services, potentially interfering with our existing customer relationships or making us less attractive to potential new customers.\nOur growth depends in part on the success of our relationships with third parties.\nWe have established relationships with a number of other companies, including financial institutions, processors, other financial services suppliers, implementation partners, technology and cloud-based hosting providers, and others. In order to grow our business, we anticipate that we will need to continue to establish and maintain relationships with third parties, and negotiating and documenting relationships with them requires significant time and resources. Our competitors may be more effective in providing incentives to third parties to favor their products or services.\nWe also provide print and mail services as part of our billing and invoicing solutions and depend on postage and delivery through the United States Postal Service. Postage and delivery is a significant cost incurred in connection with our print and mail billing and invoicing solutions. As a result of this dependence, we may be subject to shipping delays or disruptions caused by inclement weather, natural disasters, system interruptions and technology failures, labor activism, health epidemics, government shutdowns or bioterrorism.\nIf we are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining our relationships with third parties, our ability to compete in the marketplace or to grow our revenues could be impaired and our operating results could suffer. Even if we are successful in our strategic relationships, we cannot assure you that these relationships will result in increased customer usage of our platform or increased revenues.\nGrowth in usage of the BPN depends, in part, on our relationship with Visa.\nWe rely on our strategic relationship with Visa to accelerate adoption of and grow the users for and transactions processed on the BPN. We have an agreement with Visa to promote, market and expand the BPN. This relationship is significant to our BPN business, has experienced significant growth, and has led to numerous additional customers and transactions for us. Our agreement with Visa became effective on April 4, 2019 and has a term of four years through April 4, 2023 (subject to a potential one year extension). Visa may terminate the agreement for convenience on 30 days\u2019 notice subject to making certain required payments to us and in other circumstances should we not satisfy our obligations under the agreement. If for any reason our BPN relationship with Visa ends or we are unable to grow transactions and increase adoption of the BPN through that relationship, our growth prospects may be adversely affected. Visa may also seek to develop a solution of its own, acquire a solution to compete with the BPN, or decide to partner with a competitor and build a new product, thereby harming our growth prospects and adversely affecting our results of operations.\nOur business could be adversely affected if our customers are not satisfied with the implementation services provided by us or our partners.\nOur business depends on our ability to satisfy our customers with respect to our products and platform as well as the services that are performed to help our customers use features and functions of our products. Services may be performed by our own staff, by a third-party partner or by a combination of the two. Our strategy is to work with partners to increase the breadth of capability and depth of capacity for delivery of these implementation services to our customers, and we expect the number of our partner-led implementations to continue to increase over time. If a customer is not satisfied with the quality of work performed by us or a partner or with the type of services or functionality of our platform or the products delivered, we may incur additional costs in addressing the situation, the work may not be profitable to us, and the customer\u2019s dissatisfaction with our services or those of our partners could damage our ability to retain that customer or expand that customer\u2019s use of our products and services. In addition, negative publicity related to our customer relationships, regardless of its accuracy, may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new business with current and prospective customers.\nThe markets in which we participate are competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could be harmed.\nThe market for our cash cycle management products, including e-commerce order, credit application, invoice presentment, payment facilitation and automated cash applications, is fragmented, competitive, and constantly evolving. Our competitors range from large entities to smaller suppliers of solutions that focus on billing, invoicing solutions and/or electronic bill presentment and payment. With the introduction of new technologies and market entrants, we expect that the competitive environment will remain intense going forward. Accounting software providers, such as Intuit, as well as the financial institutions with which we partner, may internally develop products, acquire existing, third-party products, or may enter into partnerships or other strategic relationships that would enable them to expand their product offerings to compete with our platform or provide more comprehensive offerings than they individually had offered or achieve greater economies of scale than us. These software providers and financial institutions may have the operating flexibility to bundle competing solutions with other offerings, including offering them at a lower price or for no additional cost to customers as part of a larger sale. In addition, new entrants not currently considered to be competitors may enter the market through acquisitions, partnerships, or strategic relationships. As we look to market and sell our products and services to potential customers or partners with existing solutions, we must convince their internal stakeholders that our products and services are superior to their current solutions.\nWe compete on several factors, including:\n\u2022\nproduct features, quality, and functionality;\n\u2022\ndata asset size and ability to leverage artificial intelligence to scale with our customers\u2019 business needs;\n\u2022\nease of deployment;\n\u2022\nease of integration with customers\u2019 and partners\u2019 application programming interfaces (API) for their billing and payment systems as well as third-party technologies;\n\u2022\nability to automate processes;\n\u2022\ncloud-based delivery architecture;\n\u2022\nadvanced security and control features;\n\u2022\nbrand recognition; and\n\u2022\npricing and total cost of ownership.\nOur competitors vary in size, breadth, and scope of the products and services offered. Many of our competitors and potential competitors have greater name recognition, more established customer relationships, larger research and development and marketing budgets, a larger global footprint and greater resources than us. Our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards and customer requirements. For example, an existing competitor or new entrant could introduce new technology that reduces demand for our products or services.\nFor these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors, and this competition could result in the failure of our products and services to continue to achieve or maintain market acceptance, any of which would harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIf we fail to integrate with our customers\u2019 and partners\u2019 APIs for their billing and payment systems and with third-party technologies, our platform may become less marketable and less competitive or obsolete and our operating results may be harmed.\nOur platform must integrate with our customers\u2019 and partners\u2019 APIs for their billing and payment systems and with third-party technologies, and we need to continuously modify and enhance our platform to adapt to changes in cloud-enabled hardware, software, networking, browser and database technologies that may be implemented by our customers or partners or third-party technology providers. Any failure of our platform to integrate with our customers\u2019 or partners\u2019 APIs or with technology developed by third-party technology providers could reduce demand for and make our platform less marketable, less competitive or obsolete. In addition, an increasing number of individuals within enterprises that we serve are utilizing mobile devices to access the Internet and corporate resources and to conduct business. If we cannot continue to effectively make our platform available on these mobile devices and offer the products, services and functionality required by enterprises that widely use mobile devices, we may experience difficulty attracting and retaining customers.\nBecause our platform is sold to businesses with complex operating environments, we may encounter long and unpredictable sales cycles, which could adversely affect our operating results in a given period.\nOur ability to increase revenues and achieve profitability depends, in large part, on our ability to continue to attract mid-market and large enterprises to our platform and grow this segment of our customer base. We expect to continue to focus most of our sales efforts on these customers in the near future. Accordingly, we will continue to face greater costs, longer sales cycles and less predictability in completing some of our sales, than would be expected from selling to a predominantly small business target customer base. A delay in or failure to close a large sale to one or more prospective new customers could cause harm to our business and financial results and cause our financial results to vary significantly from period to period.\nOur typical sales cycle ranges from three to nine months. The wide range reflects that a number of timing factors can vary significantly between prospective customers, many of which we cannot control, including:\n\u2022\ncustomers\u2019 budgetary constraints and priorities;\n\u2022\nthe timing of customers\u2019 budget cycles;\n\u2022\nthe need by some customers for lengthy evaluations; and\n\u2022\nthe length and timing of customers\u2019 approval processes.\nIn addition, as a result of the recent COVID-19 pandemic, many local governments as well as enterprises have limited travel and in person meetings and implemented other restrictions that could make the sales process more lengthy and difficult.\nMid-market and large enterprises tend to have more complex operating environments than smaller businesses, making it often more difficult and time-consuming for us to demonstrate the value of our platform to these prospective customers. The customer\u2019s decision to use our platform may also be an enterprise-wide decision, and these types of sales require us to provide greater levels of education regarding the use and benefits of our platform, which causes us to expend substantial time, effort and money educating the prospective customer as to the value of our platform. In addition, we have no assurance that a prospective customer will ultimately purchase any services from us at all, regardless of the amount of time or resources we have spent on the opportunity. For example, our target customer may decide in the end to purchase software from one of our larger, more established competitors because they are unsure about moving forward with a newer and less well-known brand such as ours. As a result of the variability and length of the sales cycle, we have only a limited ability to forecast the timing of sales, and our results of operations may differ from expectations.\nInterruptions or delays in the services provided by third-party data centers or internet service providers could impair the delivery of our platform and our business could suffer.\nWe host our platform using third-party cloud infrastructure services. We also use public cloud hosting with Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure. All of our products utilize resources operated by us through these providers. We therefore depend on our third-party cloud providers\u2019 ability to protect their data centers against damage or interruption from natural disasters, power or telecommunications failures, criminal acts, and similar events. Our operations depend on protecting the cloud infrastructure hosted by such providers by maintaining their respective configuration, architecture, and interconnection specifications, as well as the information stored in these virtual data centers and transmitted by third-party internet service providers. We have periodically experienced service disruptions in the past, and we cannot assure you that we will not experience interruptions or delays in our services in the future. We may also incur significant costs for using alternative equipment or taking other actions in preparation for, or in reaction to, events that damage the data storage services we use. Although we have disaster recovery plans that utilize various data storage locations, any incident affecting our data storage or internet service providers\u2019 infrastructure that may be caused by fire, flood, severe storm, earthquake, power loss, telecommunications failures, unauthorized intrusion, computer viruses and disabling devices, natural disasters, military actions, terrorist attacks, negligence, and other similar events beyond our control could negatively affect our platform. Any prolonged service disruption affecting our platform for any of the foregoing reasons could damage our reputation with current and potential customers, expose us to liability, cause us to lose customers, or otherwise harm our business. Also, in the event of damage or interruption, our insurance policies may not adequately compensate us for any losses that we may incur. System failures or outages, including any potential disruptions due to significantly increased global demand on certain cloud-based systems during the COVID-19 pandemic, could compromise our ability to provide our products and services in a timely manner, which could harm our ability to conduct business or delay our financial reporting. Such failures could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nOur products and platform are accessed by many customers, often at the same time. As we continue to expand the number of our customers and products available to our customers, we may not be able to scale our technology to accommodate the increased capacity requirements, which may result in interruptions or delays in service. In addition, the failure of data centers, internet service providers, or other third-party service providers to meet our capacity requirements could result in interruptions or delays in access to our platform or impede our ability to grow our business and scale our operations. If our third-party infrastructure service agreements are terminated, or there is a lapse of service, interruption of internet service provider connectivity, or damage to data centers, we could experience interruptions in access to our platform as well as delays and additional expense in arranging new facilities and services.\nWe have experienced rapid growth and expect our growth to continue and if we fail to manage our growth effectively, we may be unable to execute on our plans and strategies, maintain and grow customer adoption and use of our products and services, or adequately address competitive challenges.\nWe have experienced a rapid growth in our business, headcount and operations in recent years. We anticipate that we will continue to expand our operations and headcount in the near future. This growth has placed, and future growth will place, a significant strain and demands on our management and administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. Our success will depend in part on our ability to manage this growth effectively. Although our business has experienced significant growth, we cannot provide any assurance that our business will continue to grow at the same rate or at all. As we continue to grow, we must effectively integrate, develop and motivate a large number of new employees, while maintaining the effectiveness of our business execution and the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture. In particular, we intend to continue to make directed and substantial investments to expand our research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative organizations.\nTo effectively manage growth, we must continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls, and our reporting systems and procedures by, among other things:\n\u2022\nimproving our key business applications, processes and information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) infrastructure to support our business needs;\n\u2022\nenhancing information and communication systems to ensure that our employees and offices are well-coordinated and can effectively communicate with each other and our growing base of customers and partners;\n\u2022\nenhancing our internal controls to ensure timely and accurate reporting of all of our operations and financial results; and\n\u2022\nappropriately documenting our IT systems and our business processes.\nThe systems enhancements and improvements necessary to support our business as we continue to scale will require significant capital expenditures and allocation of valuable management and employee resources. If we fail to implement these improvements effectively, our ability to manage our expected growth, ensure uninterrupted operation of our platform and comply with the rules and regulations that are applicable to public reporting companies will be impaired. Additionally, failure to effectively manage growth could result in difficulty or delays in increasing our customer base, increasing use by our customers of our products and services, declines in quality or customer satisfaction, increases in costs, difficulties in introducing new features and/or other operational difficulties, any of which could adversely affect our business performance and results of operations.\nPayments and other financial services-related regulations and oversight are material to our business, and any failure by us to comply could materially harm our business.\nThere are a wide range of federal and state agencies who regulate aspects of our business, and compliance with their various regulations can be costly and difficult.\nThe local, state, and federal laws, rules, regulations, licensing schemes and industry standards that govern our business include, or may in the future include, those relating to banking, deposit-taking, cross-border and domestic money transmission, foreign exchange, payments services (such as money transmission, payment processing, and settlement services), anti-money laundering, combating terrorist financing, escheatment, international sanctions regimes, and compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, a set of requirements designed to ensure that all companies that process, store, or transmit payment card information maintain a secure environment to protect cardholder data. We do not directly collect or store payment card information; instead, we rely on a third-party payment processor to do so.\nThese laws, rules, regulations, licensing schemes, and standards are enforced by multiple authorities and governing bodies in the United States, including the Department of the Treasury, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the SEC, self-regulatory organizations, and numerous state and local agencies. As we expand into new jurisdictions, the number of foreign laws, rules, regulations, licensing schemes, and standards governing our business will expand as well. In addition, as our business and products continue to develop and expand, we may become subject to additional laws, rules, regulations, licensing schemes, and standards. We may not always be able to accurately predict the scope or applicability of certain laws, rules, regulations, licensing schemes, or standards to our business, particularly as we expand into new areas of operations, which could have a significant negative effect on our existing business and our ability to pursue future plans.\nIf we fail to predict how a state or federal regulator might apply a law or regulation potentially applicable to us, we could be subject to obligations and restrictions with respect to the investment of customer funds, reporting requirements, bonding requirements, minimum capital requirements, and inspection by state regulatory agencies concerning various aspects of our business. This could also require changes to the manner in which we conduct some aspects of our business.\nWe rely on various exemptions from licensing, and regulators may find that we have violated applicable laws or regulations.\nWe are not licensed at the state or federal level as a money transmitter, and believe that we have valid exemptions from licensure based on our business model. In the past, certain competitors have been found to violate laws and regulations related to money transmission, and they have been subject to fines and other penalties by regulatory authorities. Regulators and third-party auditors have also identified gaps in how similar businesses have implemented anti-money laundering program. Should any state or federal regulators make a determination that we have operated as an unlicensed money services business or money transmitter, we could be subject to civil and criminal fines, penalties, costs, legal fees, reputational damage or other negative consequences.\nThe adoption of new money transmitter or money services business statutes in jurisdictions or changes in regulators\u2019 interpretation of existing state and federal money transmitter or money services business statutes or regulations could subject us to new registration or licensing requirements. Such changes could also limit business activities until we are appropriately licensed. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain or maintain any such licenses, and, even if we were able to do so, there could be substantial costs and potential product changes involved in maintaining such licenses, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business.\nThe regulatory environment we operate in is subject to constant change, and new regulations could make aspects of our business as currently conducted no longer possible.\nIn the future, as a result of the regulations applicable to our business, we could be subject to investigations and resulting liability, including governmental fines, restrictions on our business, or other sanctions, and we could be forced to cease conducting certain aspects of our business with residents of certain jurisdictions, be forced to change our business practices in certain jurisdictions, or be required to obtain additional licenses or regulatory approvals.\nGovernment agencies may impose new or additional rules on money transmission, including regulations that:\n\u2022\nprohibit, restrict, and/or impose taxes or fees on transactions in, to or from certain countries or with certain governments, individuals, and entities;\n\u2022\nimpose additional customer identification and customer due diligence requirements;\n\u2022\nimpose additional reporting or recordkeeping requirements, or require enhanced transaction monitoring;\n\u2022\nlimit the types of entities capable of providing money transmission services, or impose additional licensing or registration requirements;\n\u2022\nimpose minimum capital or other financial requirements;\n\u2022\nlimit or restrict the revenue that may be generated from money transmission, including revenue from interest earned on customer funds, transaction fees, and revenue derived from foreign exchange;\n\u2022\nrequire enhanced disclosures to our money transmission customers;\n\u2022\nrequire the principal amount of money transmission originated in a country to be invested in that country or held in trust until paid;\n\u2022\nlimit the number or principal amount of transactions that may be sent to or from a jurisdiction, whether by an individual or in the aggregate; and\n\u2022\nrestrict or limit our ability to process transactions using centralized databases, for example, by requiring that transactions be processed using a database maintained in a particular country or region.\nChanging regulatory requirements might render our products and services obsolete or might block us from developing new products and services. This might in turn impose additional costs upon us to comply or to further develop our products and services. It might also make introduction of new products and services more costly or more time-consuming than we currently anticipate. It might even prevent introduction by us of new products or services or cause the continuation of our existing products or services to become more costly.\nWe might not be able to obtain or maintain any such licenses or regulatory approvals, and, even if we were able to do so, there could be substantial costs and potential product changes involved in maintaining such licenses, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business. In addition, there are substantial costs and potential product changes involved in obtaining and maintaining licenses, certifications, and approvals, and we could be subject to fines or other enforcement action, and cease and desist orders if we are found to violate anti-money laundering, corporate governance, or license requirements. These factors could impose substantial additional costs, involve considerable delay to the development or provision of our products or services, require significant and costly operational changes, or prevent us from providing our products or services in any given market.\nWe are subject to third party audits and periodic reviews of our business, and we could face liability if we are found not in compliance with various laws and regulations.\nThird-party auditors periodically audit our anti-money laundering program. In the future, as a result of the regulations that could be deemed to apply to our business, we could be subject to investigations and resulting liability, including governmental fines, restrictions on our business, or other sanctions.\nWe depend on our senior management team and the loss of our chief executive officer or one or more key employees or an inability to attract and retain highly skilled employees could adversely affect our business.\nOur success depends largely upon the continued services of our key executive officers. In particular, our chief executive officer, Flint Lane, has led Legacy Billtrust since its inception in 2001 and is critical to our vision, strategic direction, culture and overall business success. We also rely on our leadership team in the areas of research and development, marketing, sales, services, security and compliance and general and administrative functions, and on mission-critical individual contributors in research and development. From time to time, there may be changes in our executive management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives, which could disrupt our business. We have employment agreements with some of our executive officers but the terms allow for termination by either party at any time. The loss of one or more of our executive officers or key employees could have a serious adverse effect on our business.\nTo execute our growth plan, we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel. Competition for these personnel is intense, especially for designing and developing products and software for our platform. We have from time to time experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining employees with appropriate qualifications. Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have. If we hire employees from competitors or other companies, their former employers may attempt to assert that these employees or we have breached their legal obligations, resulting in a diversion of our time and resources. Certain of our key employees have been with us for a long period of time and have fully vested stock options that may become valuable if they become publicly tradable. We cannot ensure that we will be able to retain the services of any members of our senior management or other key employees or that we would be able to timely replace members of our senior management or other key employees should any of them depart. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to offer high-quality customer support, or if our support is more expensive than anticipated, our business and reputation could suffer.\nOur customers rely on our customer support services, which we refer to as customer success, to resolve issues and realize the full benefits provided by our platform. High-quality support is also important for the renewal and expansion of our subscriptions with existing customers. We primarily provide customer support over chat and email, with limited phone-based support. If we do not help our customers quickly resolve issues and provide effective ongoing support, or if our support personnel or methods of providing support are insufficient to meet the needs of our customers, our ability to retain customers, increase adoption by our existing customers and acquire new customers could suffer, and our reputation with existing or potential customers could be harmed. If we are not able to meet the customer support needs of our customers by chat and email during the hours that we currently provide support, we may need to increase our support coverage and provide additional phone-based support, which may reduce our profitability.\nIf we fail to adapt and respond effectively to rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, changing regulations and payment methods, demand for product enhancements, new product features, and changing business needs, requirements or preferences, our products may become less competitive.\nThe market for our billing, invoicing, cash cycle management and payment facilitation solutions is subject to ongoing technological change, evolving industry standards, changing regulations and payment methods, and changing customer needs, requirements and preferences. The success of our business will depend, in part, on our ability to adapt and respond effectively to these changes on a timely basis, including launching new products and services. The success of any new product and service, or any enhancements, features, or modifications to existing products and services, depends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction, and market acceptance of such products and services, enhancements, modifications and new product features. If we are unable to enhance our platform and products, add new payment methods or develop new products that keep pace with technological and regulatory change and changes in customer preferences and achieve market acceptance, or if new technologies emerge that are able to deliver competitive products and services at lower prices, more efficiently, more conveniently, or more securely than our products, our business, operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected. Furthermore, modifications to our existing platform, products, or technology will increase our research and development expenses. Any failure of our products and services to operate effectively with existing or future customer and partner APIs for their billing and payment systems and third party technologies could reduce the demand for our services, result in customer dissatisfaction and adversely affect our business.\nIf the prices we charge for our services are unacceptable to our customers, our operating results will be harmed.\nWe generate revenue by charging customers subscription fees for our products, transaction fees based on invoices processed, payments made and payment volume, and fixed or time and materials fees for services. As the market for our product matures, or as new or existing competitors introduce new products or services that compete with ours, we may experience pricing pressure and be unable to renew our agreements with existing customers or attract new customers at prices that are consistent with our pricing model and operating budget. Our pricing strategy for new products we introduce, including our BPN business, may not attract new customers, and our competitors could choose to bundle certain products and services competitive with ours. If this were to occur, it is possible that we would have to change our pricing strategies or reduce our prices, which could harm our revenue, margins, and operating results.\nWe typically provide service level commitments under our customer agreements. If we fail to meet these contractual commitments, we could be obligated to provide credits or refunds for prepaid amounts related to unused subscription services or face contract terminations, which could adversely affect our revenue.\nOur agreements with our customers typically contain service level commitments. If we are unable to meet the stated service level commitments or suffer extended periods of unavailability for our platform or products, we may be contractually obligated to provide these customers with service credits. We have paid out service level credits in the past and may be required to pay such credits in the future. In addition, we could face contract terminations, in which case we would be subject to refunds for prepaid amounts related to unused subscription services. Our revenue could be significantly affected if we suffer unexcused downtime under our agreements with our customers. Further, any extended service outages could adversely affect our reputation, revenue, and operating results.\nWe may not be able to scale our business quickly enough to meet our customers\u2019 growing needs, and if we are not able to grow efficiently, our operating results could be harmed.\nAs usage of our products and services grows and we sign additional customers and partners, we will need to devote additional resources to improving and maintaining our infrastructure to maintain the performance of our platform and products. In addition, we will need to appropriately scale our internal business systems and our services organization, including customer support, risk and compliance operations, and services, to serve our growing customer base.\nAny failure of or delay in these efforts could result in service interruptions, impaired system performance, and reduced customer satisfaction, resulting in decreased sales to new customers, lower subscription renewal rates by existing customers, the issuance of service credits, or requested refunds, all of which could hurt our revenue growth. If sustained or repeated, these performance issues could reduce the attractiveness of our platform to customers and could result in lost customer opportunities and lower renewal rates, any of which could hurt our revenue growth, customer loyalty, and our reputation. Even if we are successful in these efforts to scale our business, they will be expensive and complex, and require the dedication of significant management time and attention. We could also face inefficiencies or service disruptions as a result of our efforts to scale our internal infrastructure. We cannot be sure that the expansion and improvements to our internal infrastructure will be effectively implemented on a timely basis, if at all, and such failures could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nFailure to effectively develop and expand our sales and marketing capabilities could harm our ability to increase our customer base and achieve broader market acceptance of our products.\nOur ability to increase our customer base and achieve broader market acceptance of our platform will depend to a significant extent on our ability to expand our sales and marketing organizations, and to deploy our sales and marketing resources efficiently. Our business and operating results will be harmed if our sales and marketing efforts do not generate significant increases in revenue. We may not achieve anticipated revenue growth from expanding our sales force if we are unable to hire, develop, integrate and retain talented and effective sales personnel, if our new and existing sales personnel are unable to achieve desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time, or if our sales and marketing programs and advertising are not effective.\nWe are subject to governmental regulation and other legal obligations, particularly those related to privacy, data protection and information security, and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our business, by resulting in litigation, fines, penalties or adverse publicity and reputational damage that may negatively affect the value of our business and decrease the price of our Common Stock. Compliance with such laws could also result in additional costs and liabilities to us or inhibit sales of our products.\nOur customers can use our platform and products to collect, use and store certain types of personal or identifying information regarding their employees, customers and their customers\u2019 employees. Federal, state and foreign government bodies and agencies have adopted, are considering adopting or may adopt laws and regulations regarding the collection, use, storage and disclosure of personal information obtained from consumers and individuals, such as compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and the now invalidated EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield protections. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, such laws and regulations that are applicable to the businesses of our customers may limit the use and adoption of our platform and reduce overall demand or lead to significant fines, penalties or liabilities for any noncompliance with such privacy laws. Furthermore, privacy concerns may cause our customers\u2019 employees to resist providing the personal data necessary to allow our customers to use our platform effectively. Even the perception of privacy concerns, whether or not valid, may inhibit market adoption of our platform in certain industries.\nAll of these domestic and international legislative and regulatory initiatives may adversely affect our ability, and our customers\u2019 ability to process, handle, store, use and transmit demographic and personal information from their employees and customers, which could reduce demand for our platform. The EU and many countries in Europe have stringent privacy laws and regulations, which may affect our handling of EU subject data. While our business is primarily focused on domestic United States customers, we do have numerous customers that are multi-national in scope. In particular, the EU has adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) which went into effect on May 25, 2018 and contains numerous requirements and changes, including more robust obligations on data processors and heavier documentation requirements for data protection compliance programs by companies. Specifically, the GDPR introduced numerous privacy-related changes for companies operating in the EU, including greater control for data subjects (e.g., the \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d), increased data portability for EU consumers, data breach notification requirements, and increased fines. In particular, under the GDPR, fines of up to 20 million Euros or up to 4% of the annual global revenue of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater, could be imposed for violations of certain of the GDPR\u2019s requirements. Complying with the GDPR may cause us to incur substantial operational costs or require us to change our business practices. Non-compliance could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities, customers, data subjects or others. We may find it necessary to establish systems in the EU to maintain personal data originating from the EU, which may involve substantial expense and distraction from other aspects of our business. In the meantime, there could be uncertainty as to how to comply with EU privacy law.\nFurther, on July 16, 2020, Europe\u2019s top court, the Court of Justice of the European Union, ruled in Schrems II (C-311/18) that the Privacy Shield, used by thousands of companies to transfer data between the EU and United States, was invalid and could no longer be used due to the strength of United States surveillance laws. On September 8, 2020 the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner of Switzerland issued an opinion concluding that the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework does not provide an adequate level of protection for data transfers from Switzerland to the United States pursuant to Switzerland\u2019s Federal Act on Data Protection. We continue to use alternative transfer mechanisms including the standard contractual clauses (\u201cSCCs\u201d) while the authorities interpret the decisions and scope of the invalidated Privacy Shield and the alternative permitted data transfer mechanisms. The SCCs, though approved by the European Commission, have faced challenges in European courts (including being called into question in Schrems II), and may be challenged, suspended or invalidated. At present, there are few if any viable alternatives to the Privacy Shield and the SCCs, so such developments may necessitate further expenditures on local infrastructure, changes to internal business processes, changes to customer facing products, or may otherwise affect or restrict sales and operations.\nFurther, the exit of the United Kingdom (UK) from the EU, often referred to as Brexit, has created uncertainty with regard to data protection regulation in the UK. Specifically, the UK exited the EU on January 1, 2020, subject to a transition period that ended December 31, 2020. Under the post-Brexit Trade and Cooperation Agreement between the EU and the UK, the UK and EU have agreed that transfers of personal data to the UK from EEA member states will not be treated as \u2018restricted transfers\u2019 to a non-EEA country for a period of up to four months from January 1, 2021, plus a potential further two months extension (the \u201cExtended Adequacy Assessment Period\u201d). Although the current maximum duration of the Extended Adequacy Assessment Period is six months, it may end sooner, for example, in the event that the European Commission adopts an adequacy decision in respect of the UK, or the UK amends the UK GDPR and/or makes certain changes regarding data transfers under the UK GDPR/Data Protection Act 2018 without the consent of the EU (unless those amendments or decisions are made simply to keep relevant UK laws aligned with the EU\u2019s data protection regime). If the European Commission does not adopt an \u2018adequacy decision\u2019 in respect of the UK prior to the expiry of the Extended Adequacy Assessment Period, from that point onwards the UK will be an \u2018inadequate third country\u2019 under the GDPR and transfers of personal data from the EEA to the UK will require a \u2018transfer mechanism\u2019 such as the Standard Contractual Clauses.\nIn addition, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which took effect on January 1, 2020, and broadly defines personal information. The CCPA has been dubbed the first \u201cGDPR-like\u201d law in the United States since it creates new individual privacy rights for consumers (as that word is broadly defined in the law) and places increased privacy and security obligations on entities handling personal data of consumers or households. The CCPA requires covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers, provides such consumers new ways to opt-out of certain sales of personal information, and allows for a new private right of action for data breaches. Because we buy and sell (as that phrase is defined in the CCPA) data that may contain personal information, we have registered as a data broker for some of our services. Further, California voters approved a new privacy law, the California Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA, in the November 3, 2020 election. Effective starting on January 1, 2023, the CPRA will significantly modify the CCPA, including by expanding consumers\u2019 rights with respect to certain sensitive personal information. The CPRA also creates a new state agency that will be vested with authority to implement and enforce the CCPA and the CPRA. New legislation proposed or enacted in various other states will continue to shape the data privacy environment nationally. For example, Virginia became the second state to enact a comprehensive privacy law when it recently passed the Consumer Data Protection Act (CDPA), which will take effect on January 1, 2023. Certain state laws may be more stringent or broader in scope, or offer greater individual rights, with respect to confidential, sensitive and personal information than federal, international or other state laws, and such laws may differ from each other, which may complicate compliance efforts. It remains unclear, however, how the CCPA and CPRA will be interpreted. As currently written the CPRA will likely impact our business activities and exemplifies the vulnerability of our business to not only cyber threats but also the evolving regulatory environment related to personal data and protected health information. The effects of this legislation are potentially far-reaching and may require us to modify our data management practices and to incur substantial expense in an effort to comply.\nSome of our products or services may subject us to the Fair Credit Reporting Act (\u201cFCRA\u201d). FCRA applies to consumer credit reporting agencies as well as data furnishers and users of consumer reports, as those terms are defined in the FCRA. The FCRA promotes the accuracy, fairness and privacy of information in the files of consumer reporting agencies that engage in the practice of assembling or evaluating information relating to consumers for certain specified purposes, including for employment. The FCRA limits the distribution and use of consumer reports and establishes consumer rights to access, correct and dispute their own credit files, among other rights and obligations. Violation of the FCRA can result in civil and criminal penalties. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and the state attorneys general, acting alone or in cooperation with one another, actively enforce the FCRA as do private litigants. Many states have enacted laws with requirements similar to the FCRA. Some of these laws impose additional, or more stringent, requirements than the FCRA.\nIn addition, the Driver\u2019s Privacy Protection Act (\u201cDPPA\u201d) restricts state departments of motor vehicles from disclosing personal information in driver records (such as names, license numbers, license photographs, phone numbers and addresses) without the driver\u2019s consent, and further restricts the use and disclosure of this information by parties that obtain it from departments of motor vehicles. The DPPA imposes criminal fines for noncompliance and allows private litigants to seek actual and punitive damages and equitable relief. Many states have enacted laws with requirements similar to the DPPA. Some of these laws impose additional, or more stringent, requirements than the DPPA.\nBecause the interpretation and application of many privacy and data protection laws along with contractually imposed industry standards are uncertain, it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our existing data management practices or the features of our products and platform capabilities. If so, in addition to the possibility of fines, lawsuits, and other claims and penalties, we could be required to fundamentally change our business activities and practices or modify our products and platform capabilities, which could have an adverse effect on our business. Any inability to adequately address privacy and security concerns, even if unfounded, or comply with applicable privacy and data security laws, regulations, and policies, could result in additional cost and liability to us, governmental investigations and enforcement actions, litigation, fines and penalties, or adverse publicity, and could cause our customers and partners to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business.\nWe expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws, regulations and industry standards relating to privacy, data protection, information security, marketing, and consumer communications, and we cannot determine the impact such future laws, regulations, and standards may have on our business. Future laws, regulations, standards, and other obligations or any changed interpretation of existing laws or regulations could impair our ability to develop and market new functionality and maintain and grow our customer base and increase revenue. Future restrictions on the collection, use, sharing, or disclosure of data, or additional requirements for express or implied consent of our customers, partners, or our customers\u2019 customers for the use and disclosure of such information could require us to incur additional costs or modify our platform, possibly in a material manner, and could limit our ability to develop new functionality.\nWe plan to expand our operations to new markets outside the United States, creating a variety of operational challenges.\nAlthough we currently have numerous customers that are multi-national in scope, our business is currently primarily focused on domestic United States customers. A component of our growth strategy involves expanding our operations outside the United States.\nOur growth strategy for expanding our operations outside the United States will require significant resources and management attention and will subject us to regulatory, economic and political risks that are different from those in the United States, including:\n\u2022\nthe need to localize and adapt our platform for specific countries, including translation into foreign languages and associated expenses;\n\u2022\ndata privacy laws that require customer data to be stored and processed in a designated territory;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations and working with foreign partners;\n\u2022\ndifferent pricing environments, longer sales cycles and longer accounts receivable payment cycles and collections issues;\n\u2022\nnew and different sources of competition;\n\u2022\nweaker protection for intellectual property and other legal rights than in the United States and practical difficulties in enforcing intellectual property and other rights outside of the United States;\n\u2022\nlaws and business practices favoring local competitors;\n\u2022\ncompliance challenges related to the complexity of multiple, conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations, including employment, tax, privacy and data protection laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nincreased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the transfer of funds;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could increase the price of our products outside of the United States, increase the expenses of our international operations and expose us to foreign currency exchange rate risk;\n\u2022\nadverse tax consequences;\n\u2022\nunstable regional and economic political conditions; and\n\u2022\nthe fragmentation of longstanding regulatory frameworks caused by Brexit.\nAs we move to expand our business globally, our success will depend, in large part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with international sales and operations. Our failure to manage any of these risks successfully, or to comply with these laws and regulations, could harm our operations, reduce our sales and harm our business, operating results and financial condition. For example, in certain foreign countries, particularly those with developing economies, certain business practices that are prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, may be more commonplace. Although we have policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, our employees, contractors and agents, as well as partners involved in our international sales, may take actions in violation of our policies. Any such violation could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation.\nSome of our partners also have international operations and are subject to the risks described above. Even if we are able to successfully manage the risks of international operations, our business may be adversely affected if our partners are not able to successfully manage these risks.\nAcquisitions, strategic investments, partnerships, collaborations or alliances could be difficult to identify and integrate, divert the attention of management, disrupt our business, dilute our stockholder value, and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nWe have in the past acquired and may in the future seek to acquire or invest in businesses, products, or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our products or platform, enhance our technical capabilities, or otherwise offer growth opportunities. The pursuit of potential acquisitions may disrupt our business, divert our resources and the attention of management and cause us to incur various expenses in identifying, investigating, and pursuing suitable acquisitions, whether or not such acquisitions are completed. In addition, we may not successfully identify desirable acquisition targets, or if we acquire additional businesses, we may not be able to integrate them effectively following the acquisition or effectively manage the combined business following the acquisition. Acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, as well as unfavorable accounting treatment and exposure to claims and disputes by third parties, including intellectual property claims. A significant portion of the purchase price of companies we acquire may be allocated to acquired goodwill and other intangible assets. If our acquisitions do not yield expected returns, we may be required to take charges to our operating results based on the annual impairment assessment process for goodwill and intangible assets, which could adversely affect our results of operations. We also may not generate sufficient financial returns to offset the costs and expenses related to any acquisitions. In addition, if an acquired business fails to meet our expectations, our business, operating results and financial condition may suffer.\nWe use open source software in our products, and any failure to comply with the terms of one or more of these open source licenses could negatively affect our business or subject us to litigation.\nPortions of our platform and products utilize software governed by open source licenses. From time to time, there have been claims challenging the ownership of open source software against companies that incorporate it into their products. There is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to market our products or platform. By the terms of certain open source licenses, if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner, we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary software and make it available under open source licenses. In the event that portions of our proprietary software are determined to be subject to an open source license, we could be required to publicly release the affected portions of our source code, or to re-engineer all or a portion of our technologies or otherwise be limited in the licensing of our technologies, each of which could reduce or eliminate the value of our products, technologies and services.\nIf we fail to maintain and enhance our brand, our ability to expand our customer base will be impaired and our business, operating results and financial condition may suffer.\nWe believe that developing and maintaining widespread awareness of our brand in a cost-effective manner is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our products and attracting new customers. Successfully maintaining and enhancing our brand will depend largely on the effectiveness of our marketing and demand generation efforts, our ability to provide reliable products that continue to meet the needs of our customers at competitive prices, our ability to maintain our customers\u2019 trust, our ability to continue to develop new functionality and products, and our ability to successfully differentiate our platform and products from competitive products and services. Our brand promotion activities may not generate customer awareness or yield increased revenue, and even if they do, any increased revenue may not offset the expenses we incur in building our brand. If we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand, our business could suffer.\nIf we fail to adequately protect our proprietary rights, our competitive position could be impaired and we may lose valuable assets, generate less revenue and incur costly litigation to protect our rights.\nOur success and ability to compete depend in part upon our intellectual property. We primarily rely on copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, trade secret protection and confidentiality or contractual agreements with our employees, customers, partners and others to protect our intellectual property rights. However, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property rights may be inadequate.\nIn order to protect our intellectual property rights, we may be required to expend significant resources to monitor and protect such rights. Litigation brought to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly, time-consuming and distracting to management and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property. Furthermore, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. Our failure to secure, protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could seriously adversely affect our brand and our business.\nWe may be sued by third parties for various claims including alleged infringement of our proprietary rights.\nWe are involved in various legal matters arising from normal course of business activities. These may include claims, suits, and other proceedings involving alleged infringement of third-party patents and other intellectual property rights, as well as commercial, contract, corporate, labor and employment, wage and hour, and other matters. Our competitors, as well as a number of other entities and individuals, may own or claim to own intellectual property relating to our industry, and third parties may claim that we are infringing upon their intellectual property rights.\nWe may experience future claims that our platform and underlying technology infringe or violate others\u2019 intellectual property rights, and it is possible we may be found to be infringing upon such rights. We may be unaware of the intellectual property rights that others may claim cover some or all of our technology, products or services. Any claims or litigation could cause us to incur significant expenses and, if successfully asserted against it, could require that we pay substantial damages or ongoing royalty payments, prevent us from offering our products or services or require that we comply with other unfavorable terms. We may also be obligated to indemnify our customers and partners or to pay substantial settlement costs, including royalty payments, in connection with any such claim or litigation and to obtain licenses, modify our platform or refund fees, which could be costly. Even if we were to prevail in such a dispute, any litigation regarding intellectual property could be costly, distracting and time-consuming and could harm our brand, business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIndemnity and liability provisions in various agreements potentially expose us to substantial liability for intellectual property infringement, data protection, and other losses.\nOur agreements with customers typically include indemnification provisions under which we agree to indemnify them for losses suffered or incurred as a result of claims of intellectual property infringement, data protection, damages caused by us to property or persons, or other liabilities relating to or arising from our contractual obligations. Some of our contracts provide for uncapped liability and some indemnity provisions survive termination or expiration of the applicable agreement. Large indemnity or liability payments could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. Although we normally limit our liability with respect to such obligations in our contracts with customers, we may still incur substantial liability, and we may be required to cease use of certain functions of our platform or products, as a result of intellectual property-related claims. Any dispute with a customer with respect to these obligations could have adverse effects on our relationship with that customer and harm our business and operating results. In addition, although we carry insurance, our insurance may not be adequate to protect us from liabilities or damages with respect to claims alleging compromises of customer data, and any such coverage may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.\nChanges to payment card networks fees or rules could harm our business.\nWe are required to comply with Visa, Mastercard, American Express and related payment card network operating rules in connection with our card payments services, and we act as a Payment Facilitator under the rules of the various payment card networks, including Visa, Mastercard and American Express. We have agreed to reimburse our service providers for any fines they are assessed by payment card networks as a result of any rule violations by us. We may also be directly liable to the payment card networks for rule violations. The payment card networks set and interpret the card operating rules. The payment card networks could adopt new operating rules or interpret or reinterpret existing rules that we or our processors might find difficult or even impossible to follow, or costly to implement. We also may seek to introduce other products in the future, which could entail additional operating rules. As a result of any violations of rules, new rules being implemented, or increased fees, we could lose our ability to make payments using cards, or such payments could become prohibitively expensive for us or for our customers. If we are unable to facilitate payments using cards, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight. Our failure to comply with extensive, complex, overlapping, and frequently changing rules, regulations, and legal interpretations could materially harm our business.\nOur success and increased visibility may result in increased regulatory oversight and enforcement and more restrictive rules and regulations that apply to our business. We are subject to a wide variety of local, state, federal, and international laws, rules, regulations and industry standards where we operate. These laws, rules, regulations, and standards govern numerous areas that are important to our business. In addition to the payments and financial services-related regulations, and the privacy, data protection, and information security-related laws described elsewhere in these risk factors, our business is also subject to, without limitation, rules and regulations applicable to: labor and employment, immigration, competition, and marketing and communications practices. Laws, rules, regulations, and standards applicable to our business are subject to changes and evolving interpretations and application, including by means of legislative changes and/or executive orders, and it can be difficult to predict how they may be applied to our business and the way we conduct our operations, particularly as we introduce new products and services and expand into new jurisdictions. We may not be able to respond quickly or effectively to regulatory, legislative, and other developments, and these changes may in turn impair our ability to offer our existing or planned features, products, and services and/or increase our cost of doing business.\nAlthough we have a compliance program focused on the laws, rules, regulations and industry standards that we have assessed are applicable to our business, there can be no assurance that our employees or contractors will not violate such laws, rules, regulations, and industry standards. Any failure or perceived failure to comply with existing or new laws, rules, regulations, industry standards or orders of any governmental authority (including changes to or expansion of the interpretation of those laws, rules, regulations, standards or orders), may:\n\u2022\nsubject us to significant fines, penalties, criminal and civil lawsuits, forfeiture of significant assets, audits, inquiries, whistleblower complaints, adverse media coverage, investigations, and enforcement actions in one or more jurisdictions levied by federal, state, local or foreign regulators, state attorneys general and private plaintiffs who may be acting as private attorneys general pursuant to various applicable federal, state, and local laws;\n\u2022\nresult in licensure and additional compliance requirements;\n\u2022\nincrease regulatory scrutiny of our business; and\n\u2022\nrestrict our operations and force us to change our business practices or compliance program, make product or operational changes, or delay planned product launches or improvements.\nAny of the foregoing could, individually or in the aggregate, harm our reputation as a trusted provider, damage our brands and business, cause us to lose existing customers, prevent us from obtaining new customers, require us to expend significant funds to remedy problems caused by breaches and to avert further breaches, expose us to legal risk and potential liability, and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur customers may fail to pay us in accordance with the terms of their agreements, necessitating claims or litigation by us to compel payment.\nWe typically enter into multiple year arrangements with our customers, some of which are cancelable. If customers fail to pay us under the terms of our agreements, we may be adversely affected from both the inability to collect amounts due and the cost of enforcing the terms of our contracts, including litigation. Furthermore, some of our customers may seek bankruptcy protection or other similar relief and fail to pay amounts due to us, or pay those amounts more slowly, either of which could adversely affect our operating results, financial position and cash flow. The recent and ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic may also increase the likelihood of these risks.\nWe may require additional capital to support the growth of our business, and this capital might not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.\nWe have funded our operations since inception primarily through equity financings, credit facilities, sales of subscriptions to our products, and usage-based transaction fees. We intend to continue to make investments to support our business, which may require us to engage in equity or debt financings in addition to the funds we received in connection with the Business Combination and the concurrent sale of PIPE shares to secure additional funds. Additional financing may not be available on terms favorable to us, if at all. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to invest in future growth opportunities, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, a recession, depression or other sustained adverse market event could materially and adversely affect our business.\nOur ability to use net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes may be limited in connection with the Business Combination or other ownership changes.\nWe have incurred tax losses during our history and do not expect to become profitable for tax purposes in the near future. To the extent that we continue to generate tax losses, unused losses will carry forward to offset future taxable income, if any, until such unused losses expire, if at all (depending on the tax year in which such losses were incurred). As of December 31, 2020, Legacy Billtrust had U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $79 million. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in 2017 (the \u201cTax Act\u201d), as modified by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act enacted in 2020 (\u201cCARES Act\u201d), U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards generated in taxable periods beginning after December 31, 2017 may be carried forward indefinitely, but the deductibility of such net operating loss carryforwards in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2020 is limited to 80% of taxable income. It is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the Tax Act or the CARES Act. In addition, net operating loss carryforwards are subject to review and possible adjustment by the IRS and state tax authorities.\nUnder Sections 382 and 383 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), federal net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes may become subject to an annual limitation in the event of certain cumulative changes in our ownership. An \u201cownership change\u201d pursuant to Section 382 of the Code generally occurs if one or more stockholders or groups of stockholders who own at least 5% of the company\u2019s stock increase their ownership by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage within a rolling three-year period. Our ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes to offset future taxable income or tax liabilities may be limited as a result of ownership changes, including changes that occurred in connection with the Business Combination or other transactions. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. We have not yet determined the amount of the cumulative change in our ownership resulting from the Business Combination or other transactions, or any resulting limitations on our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes. If we earn taxable income, such limitations could result in increased future income tax liability to us and our future cash flows could be adversely affected. We have recorded a full valuation allowance related to our net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of the ultimate realization of the future benefits of those assets.\nWe could be required to collect additional sales taxes or be subject to other tax liabilities that may increase the costs our customers would have to pay for our products and adversely affect our operating results.\nThe vast majority of states have considered or adopted laws that impose tax collection obligations on out-of-state companies. States where we have a nexus may require us to calculate, collect, and remit taxes on sales in their jurisdictions. Additionally, the Supreme Court of the United States recently ruled in South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc. et al. (\u201cWayfair\u201d) that online sellers can be required to collect sales and use tax despite not having a physical presence in the buyer\u2019s state. In response to Wayfair, or otherwise, states or local governments may enforce laws requiring us to calculate, collect, and remit taxes on sales in their jurisdictions. While we do not believe that we have any material unrecorded liability as it relates to Wayfair, we may be obligated to collect and remit sales and use tax in states in which we have not collected and remitted sales and use tax. A successful assertion by one or more states requiring us to collect taxes where we historically have not or presently do not do so could result in substantial tax liabilities, including taxes on past sales, as well as penalties and interest. The imposition by state governments or local governments of sales tax collection obligations on out-of-state sellers could also create additional administrative burdens for us, put us at a perceived competitive disadvantage if state governments or local governments do not impose similar obligations on our competitors, and decrease our future sales, which could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nChanges in our effective tax rate or tax liability may adversely affect our operating results.\nOur effective tax rate could increase due to several factors, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in the relative amounts of income before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate due to differing statutory tax rates in various jurisdictions;\n\u2022\nchanges in tax laws, tax treaties, and regulations or the interpretation of them, including the Tax Act as modified by the CARES Act;\n\u2022\nchanges to our assessment about our ability to realize our deferred tax assets that are based on estimates of our future results, the prudence and feasibility of possible tax planning strategies, and the economic and political environments in which we do business;\n\u2022\nthe outcome of current and future tax audits, examinations, or administrative appeals; and\n\u2022\nlimitations or adverse findings regarding our ability to do business in some jurisdictions.\nAny of these developments could adversely affect our operating results.\nIf our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies prove to be incorrect, or if there are changes in accounting principles, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nU.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d), is subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d), the SEC and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported operating results and financial condition and could affect the reporting of transactions already completed before the announcement of a change.\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities, and equity, and the amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Significant estimates and judgments involve the identification of performance obligations in revenue recognition, the valuation of the stock based awards, including the determination of fair value of common stock, and the period of benefit for amortizing deferred commissions and deferred implementation costs, among others. Our operating results may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions.\nAny future litigation against us could be costly and time-consuming to defend.\nWe have in the past and may in the future become subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, such as claims brought by our customers in connection with commercial disputes, employment claims made by our current or former employees, and other types of claims. Litigation might result in substantial costs and may divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which might seriously harm our business, overall financial condition and operating results. Insurance might not cover such claims, might not provide sufficient payments to cover all the costs to resolve one or more such claims, and might not continue to be available on terms acceptable to us. A claim brought against us that is uninsured or underinsured could result in unanticipated costs and adversely impact our operating results.\nOur estimates of market opportunity and forecasts of market growth may prove to be inaccurate, and even if the market in which we compete achieves the forecasted growth, our business could fail to grow at similar rates, if at all.\nMarket opportunity estimates and growth forecasts, including those we have generated ourself, are subject to significant uncertainty and are based on assumptions and estimates that may not prove to be accurate. The variables that go into the calculation of our market opportunity are subject to change over time, and there is no guarantee that any particular number or percentage of companies covered by our market opportunity estimates will purchase our products at all or generate any particular level of revenue for us. Any expansion in our market depends on a number of factors, including the cost, performance, and perceived value associated with our platform and products and those of our competitors. Even if the market in which we compete meets the size estimates and growth forecasted, our business could fail to grow at similar rates, if at all. Our growth is subject to many factors, including our success in implementing our growth strategies, which are subject to many risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, our forecasts of market growth should not be taken as indicative of our future growth.\nWe are subject to governmental laws and requirements regarding economic and trade sanctions, anti-money laundering, and counter-terror financing that could impair our ability to compete in our markets or subject us to criminal or civil liability if we violate them.\nAlthough we primarily currently only operate in the United States, in the future we will likely seek to expand internationally and will become subject to additional laws and regulations, and will need to implement new regulatory controls to comply with applicable laws. We are currently required to comply with U.S. economic and trade sanctions administered by the U.S. Department of Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d), and we have processes in place to comply with the OFAC regulations as well as similar requirements in other jurisdictions. As part of our compliance efforts, we scan our customers against OFAC and other watchlists. We are also subject to various anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing laws and regulations around the world that prohibit, among other things, our involvement in transferring the proceeds of criminal activities. Our services are also subject to anti-money laundering laws and regulations and similar laws and regulations requiring a risk-based anti-money laundering program as required by our financial institution and processor partners. Regulators in the United States and globally continue to increase their scrutiny of compliance with these obligations, which may require us to further revise or expand our compliance program.\nWe are subject to anti-corruption, anti-bribery, and similar laws, and non-compliance with such laws can subject us to criminal or civil liability and harm our business.\nWe are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, anti-bribery laws, and other anti-corruption laws. Anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws have been enforced aggressively in recent years and are interpreted broadly to generally prohibit companies, their employees, and their third-party intermediaries from authorizing, offering, or providing, directly or indirectly, improper payments or benefits to recipients in the public sector. We may engage with partners and third-party intermediaries to market our services and to obtain necessary permits, licenses, and other regulatory approvals. In addition, we or our third-party intermediaries may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities. We can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party intermediaries, and of our employees, representatives, contractors, partners, and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities. We cannot assure you that all of our employees and agents will not take actions in violation of our policies and applicable law, for which we may be ultimately held responsible.\nDetecting, investigating, and resolving actual or alleged violations of anti-corruption laws can require a significant diversion of time, resources, and attention from senior management. In addition, noncompliance with anti-corruption or anti-bribery laws could subject us to whistleblower complaints, investigations, sanctions, settlements, prosecution, enforcement actions, fines, damages, other civil or criminal penalties, injunctions, suspension or debarment from contracting with certain persons, reputational harm, adverse media coverage, and other collateral consequences.\nIf we cannot maintain our company culture as we grow, we could lose the innovation, teamwork, passion and focus on execution that we believe contribute to our success and our business may be harmed.\nWe believe that a critical component of our success has been our company culture, which is based on our core values of ensuring customer success, focusing on results and striving for excellence. We have invested substantial time and resources in building our team within this company culture. As we grow, we may find it difficult to maintain these important aspects of our company culture. If we fail to preserve our culture, our ability to retain and recruit personnel and to effectively focus on and pursue our corporate objectives could be compromised, potentially harming our business.\nWe expect fluctuations in our financial results, making it difficult to project future results.\nOur operating results have fluctuated in the past and are expected to fluctuate in the future due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. As a result, our past results may not be indicative of our future performance. In addition to the other risks described herein, factors that may affect our operating results include the following:\n\u2022\nfluctuations in demand for or pricing of our products and platform;\n\u2022\nour ability to attract new customers;\n\u2022\nour ability to retain and grow engagement with our existing customers;\n\u2022\nthe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our employees, customers and partners, and our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition;\n\u2022\nour ability to expand our relationships with our financial institution partners or BPN partners, or to identify and attract new partners;\n\u2022\ncustomer expansion rates;\n\u2022\nchanges in customer preference for cloud-based products and services as a result of security breaches in the industry or privacy concerns, or other security or reliability concerns regarding our products or services;\n\u2022\nfluctuations or delays in purchasing decisions in anticipation of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in customers\u2019 budgets and in the timing of their budget cycles and purchasing decisions;\n\u2022\npotential and existing customers choosing our competitors\u2019 products or developing their own solutions in-house;\n\u2022\nthe development or introduction of new platforms, products or services that are easier to use or more advanced than our current suite of products and services, especially related to the application of artificial intelligence-based services;\n\u2022\nour failure to adapt to new technology that is widely accepted;\n\u2022\nour ability to control costs, including our operating expenses;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of payment for operating expenses, particularly research and development and sales and marketing expenses, including commissions;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of non-cash expenses, including stock based compensation, goodwill impairments, if any, and other non-cash charges;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of costs involved with our expansion into markets outside the United States;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of costs associated with recruiting, training, and integrating new employees, and retaining and motivating existing employees;\n\u2022\nthe effects of acquisitions and their integration;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions, both domestically and internationally, as well as economic conditions specifically affecting industries in which our customers participate;\n\u2022\nthe impact of new accounting pronouncements;\n\u2022\nchanges in the competitive dynamics of our market;\n\u2022\nsecurity breaches of, technical difficulties with, or interruptions to, the delivery and use of our platform; and\n\u2022\nawareness of our brand and our reputation in our target markets.\nAny of these and other factors, or the cumulative effect of some of these factors, may cause our operating results to vary significantly. In addition, we expect to incur significant additional expenses due to the increased costs of operating as a public company. If our quarterly operating results fall below market expectations, the price of our Common Stock could decline substantially, and we could face costly lawsuits, including class action lawsuits.\nWe will incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management will be required to devote substantial time to compliance with our public company responsibilities and corporate governance practices.\nWe are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and are required to comply with the applicable requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d) and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (\u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d), as well as rules and regulations subsequently implemented by the SEC and the listing requirements of Nasdaq, and other applicable securities rules and regulations, which impose various requirements on public companies, including the establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and changes in corporate governance practices. Compliance with these requirements will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time consuming and costly. In addition, our management and other personnel will divert attention from operational and other business matters to devote substantial time to these public company requirements. In particular, we expect to incur significant expenses and devote substantial management effort toward ensuring ongoing compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We may need to hire additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge and maintain an internal audit function. We cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur as a result of being a public company.\nIn addition, changing laws, regulations, and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs, and making some activities more time consuming. These laws, regulations, and standards are subject to varying interpretations and may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations, and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations, and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to their application and practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be adversely affected.\nThe rules and regulations applicable to public companies make it more expensive for us to obtain and maintain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d), particularly to serve on our audit committee and compensation committee, and qualified executive officers.\nOur management has limited experience in operating a public company.\nCertain members of our management team have limited experience in the management of a publicly traded company, and our management team has not worked together at prior companies that were publicly traded. Our management team may not successfully or effectively manage our transition to a public company that will be subject to significant regulatory oversight and reporting obligations under federal securities laws. Their limited experience in dealing with the increasingly complex laws pertaining to public companies could be a significant disadvantage in that it is likely that an increasing amount of their time may be devoted to these activities which will result in less time being devoted to the management and growth our company. We may not have adequate personnel with the appropriate level of knowledge, experience and training in the accounting policies, practices or internal control over financial reporting required of public companies in the United States. We also may need to modify our finance and accounting systems to be more suitable for a public company, and a delay could impact our ability or prevent us from timely reporting our operating results, timely filing required reports with the SEC and complying with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The development and implementation of the standards and controls necessary for us to achieve the level of accounting standards required of a public company in the United States may require costs greater than expected. It is possible that we will be required to expand our employee base and hire additional employees to support our operations as a public company which will increase our operating costs in future periods.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Securities\nConcentration of ownership among our existing executive officers, directors and their respective affiliates may prevent new investors from influencing significant corporate decisions.\nAt the closing of the Business Combination, Flint Lane beneficially owned approximately 16.8% of the outstanding Common Stock and our executive officers, directors and their respective affiliates as a group beneficially owned approximately 18.3% of the outstanding Common Stock. As a result, these stockholders are able to exercise a significant level of control over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, amendment of our Certificate of Incorporation and approval of significant corporate transactions. This control could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us or changes in management and will make the approval of certain transactions difficult or impossible without the support of these stockholders.\nWe do not expect to declare any dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe do not anticipate declaring any cash dividends to holders of Common Stock in the foreseeable future. Consequently, investors may need to rely on sales of their shares after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment.\nThe Certificate of Incorporation requires, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that derivative actions brought in our name against our respective directors, officers, other employees or stockholders for breach of fiduciary duty and other similar actions may be brought only in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware, which may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors, officers, other employees or stockholders, as applicable.\nThe Certificate of Incorporation requires, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that derivative actions brought in our name against our respective directors, officers, other employees or stockholders for breach of fiduciary duty and other similar actions may be brought only in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware except any action (A) as to which the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware determines that there is an indispensable party not subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery (and the indispensable party does not consent to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery within ten days following such determination), (B) which is vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or forum other than the Court of Chancery, or (C) for which the Court of Chancery does not have subject matter jurisdiction. This exclusive forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our respective directors, officers, other employees or stockholders, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims, although our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived their compliance with federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. However, there is no assurance that a court would enforce the choice of forum provision contained in the Certificate of Incorporation. If a court were to find such provision to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe Certificate of Incorporation provides that the exclusive forum provision will be applicable to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. The Certificate of Incorporation also provides that (A) the exclusive forum provision shall not apply to claims or causes of action brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction and (B) unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the federal district courts of the United States will be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act.\nSection 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. As a result, the exclusive forum provision will not apply to suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. Accordingly, both state and federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain such claims. As noted above, the Certificate of Incorporation provides that the federal district courts of the United States will be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action under the Securities Act. Due to the concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts created by Section 22 of the Securities Act over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder, there is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce the exclusive forum provision. Investors also cannot waive compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about us, our business or our market, or if they change their recommendations regarding our Common Stock adversely, the price and trading volume of our Common Stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our Common Stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors. If any of the analysts who may cover us change their recommendation regarding our stock adversely, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, the price of our Common Stock would likely decline. If any analyst who may cover us were to cease their coverage or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nA significant portion of our total outstanding shares of our Common Stock are restricted from immediate resale but may be sold into the market in the near future. This could cause the market price of our Common Stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our Common Stock in the public market could occur at any time. These sales, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our Common Stock. We are unable to predict the effect that sales may have on the prevailing market price of our Common Stock.\nTo the extent our Warrants are exercised, additional shares of our Common Stock will be issued, which will result in dilution to the holders of our Common Stock and increase the number of shares eligible for resale in the public market. Sales, or the potential sales, of substantial numbers of shares in the public market by selling securityholders, subject to certain restrictions on transfer until the termination of applicable lock-up periods, could increase the volatility of the market price of our Common Stock or adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock.\nUnder the Registration Rights Agreement (as defined below) and the Subscription Agreements, we have filed a registration statement to register the resale of any shares of Common Stock issued to (a) the Subscribers pursuant to the Subscription Agreements and (b) certain of the stockholder parties to the Registration Rights Agreement. See Item 13 \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence\u201d for a discussion of the Registration Rights Agreement and the Subscription Agreements.\nWe may issue additional common stock or preferred stock, including under our equity incentive plan. Any such issuances would dilute the interest of our stockholders and likely present other risks.\nWe may issue a substantial number of additional shares of common or preferred stock, including under our equity incentive plan. Any such issuances of additional shares of common or preferred stock:\n\u2022\nmay significantly dilute the equity interests of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nmay subordinate the rights of holders of Common Stock if preferred stock is issued with rights senior to those afforded our Common Stock;\n\u2022\ncould cause a change in control if a substantial number of shares of our Common Stock are issued, which may affect, among other things, our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards, if any, and could result in the resignation or removal of our present officers and directors; and\n\u2022\nmay adversely affect prevailing market prices for our Common Stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions contained in the Certificate of Incorporation and the Bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt.\nThe Certificate of Incorporation and our Bylaws contain provisions that could have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or changes in our management without the consent of the Board. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nno cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u2022\nthe exclusive right of the Board to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the Board or the resignation, death, or removal of a director with or without cause by stockholders, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on the Board;\n\u2022\nthe ability of the Board to determine whether to issue shares of our preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer;\n\u2022\na prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nthe requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by the chairperson of the Board, the chief executive officer or the Board, which may delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors;\n\u2022\nlimiting the liability of, and providing indemnification to, our directors and officers;\n\u2022\ncontrolling the procedures for the conduct and scheduling of stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nproviding for a staggered board, in which the members of the Board are divided into three classes to serve for a period of three years from the date of their respective appointment or election;\n\u2022\ngranting the ability to remove directors with cause by the affirmative vote of 66 2\u20443 % in voting power of the outstanding shares of Common Stock entitled to vote thereon;\n\u2022\nrequiring the affirmative vote of at least 66 2\u20443% of the voting power of the outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, to amend the Bylaws or Articles V, VI, VII, VIII and IX of the Certificate of Incorporation; and\n\u2022\nadvance notice procedures that stockholders must comply with in order to nominate candidates to the Board or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\nThese provisions, alone or together, could delay hostile takeovers and changes in control of us or changes in the Board and our management.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the DGCL, which prevents some stockholders holding more than 15% of our outstanding Common Stock from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of substantially all of our Common Stock. Any provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, the Bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of Common Stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for Common Stock.\nOur unaudited pro forma financial information may not be indicative of what our actual financial position or results of operations would have been.\nThe unaudited pro forma financial information provided in our SEC filings is presented for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of what our actual financial position or results of operations would have been had the Business Combination been completed on the dates indicated.\nOur failure to timely and effectively implement controls and procedures required by Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are required to provide management\u2019s attestation on internal controls in accordance with applicable SEC guidance. The standards required for a public company under Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act are significantly more stringent than those required of Legacy Billtrust as a privately-held company. Management may not be able to effectively and timely implement controls and procedures that adequately respond to the increased regulatory compliance and reporting requirements that became applicable after the Business Combination. If we are not able to implement the additional requirements of Section 404(a) in a timely manner or with adequate compliance, we may not be able to assess whether our internal controls over financial reporting are effective, which may subject us to adverse regulatory consequences and could harm investor confidence and the market price of our securities.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d within the meaning of the Securities Act, and if we take advantage of certain exemptions from disclosure requirements available to emerging growth companies, it could make our securities less attractive to investors and may make it more difficult to compare our performance to the performance of other public companies.\nWe qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible for and take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies for as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, including, but not limited to, (i) not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (ii) reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and (iii) exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. As a result, our stockholders may not have access to certain information they may deem important. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which the market value of the Common Stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of June 30 of that fiscal year, (ii) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of $1.07 billion or more during such fiscal year (as indexed for inflation), (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt in the prior three-year period or (iv) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of SMMC Class A Common Stock in the IPO. We cannot predict whether investors will find our securities less attractive because we rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result of our reliance on these exemptions, the trading prices of our securities may be lower than they otherwise would be, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the trading prices of our securities may be more volatile.\nFurther, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our consolidated financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.", "PERMNO": 18852, "SIC": 9995, "TIC": "SMMC"}
