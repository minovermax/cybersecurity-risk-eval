RISK FACTORS\nThere have been a number of material developments both within the Company and the long-term care industry. These developments have had and are likely to continue to have a material impact on us. This section summarizes these developments, as well as other risks that should be considered by our shareholders and prospective investors.\nRisks Related to our Operations\nWe are substantially self-insured and have significant potential professional liability exposure.\nThe provision of health care services entails an inherent risk of liability. Participants in the health care industry are subject to an increasing number of lawsuits alleging malpractice, negligence, product liability or related legal theories, many of which involve large claims and significant defense costs. Like many other companies engaged in the long-term care profession in the United States, we have numerous pending liability claims, disputes and legal actions for professional liability and other related issues. We expect to continue to be subject to such suits as a result of the nature of our business. See \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings\u201d for further descriptions of pending claims and see \u201cItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition - Accounting Policies and Judgments - Professional Liability and Other Self-Insurance Reserves\u201d for discussion of our reserve for self-insured claims and of our ability to meet our anticipated cash needs.\nWe have professional liability insurance coverage for our nursing centers that, based on historical claims experience, is likely to be substantially less than the amount required to satisfy claims that are expected to be incurred.\nWe may have substantial adjustments to our accrual for professional liability claims which could cause significant changes in our net earnings.\nEach year, we record adjustments to our accrual for self-insured risks associated with professional liability claims. While these adjustments to the accrual result in changes to reported expenses and income, they are not directly related to changes in cash because the accrual is not funded. These self-insurance reserves are assessed on a quarterly basis, with changes in estimated losses being recorded in the consolidated statements of operations in the period identified. Any increase in the accrual decreases income in the period, and any reduction in the accrual increases income during the period. Our actual professional liabilities may vary significantly from the accrual due to an increase in the number of claims asserted or claim costs in excess of estimates, and the amount of the accrual has and may continue to fluctuate by a material amount in any given quarter. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recorded professional liability expense of $8.5 million, $8.1 million and $7.2 million, respectively.\nOur outstanding indebtedness is subject to various financial covenants and floating rates of interest which could be subject to fluctuations based on changing interest rates.\nWe have long-term indebtedness of $80.1 million at December 31, 2016. Certain of our debt agreements contain various financial covenants, the most restrictive of which relate to minimum cash deposits, cash flow and debt service coverage ratios. As of December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with these financial covenants. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of some or all of our debts. Such non-compliance could result in a material adverse impact to our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. See \u201cItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d for additional discussion of our covenants.\nIn connection with the refinancing transaction in February 2016 discussed in \u201cItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources,\u201d we entered into an interest rate swap with respect to a portion of the mortgage loan to mitigate the floating interest rate risk of such borrowing. The interest rate swap converted the variable rate on our mortgage indebtedness to a fixed interest rate for the five year term of this indebtedness, decreasing our exposure to risks of variable rates of interest. While limiting our risk to increases in interest rates by utilizing the interest rate swap, we forgo benefits that might result from downward fluctuations in interest rates. We also are exposed to the risk that our counterpart to the swap agreement will default on its obligations.\nOur accrual for professional liability claims is not funded, and if a material judgment is entered against us in any lawsuit, we may lack adequate cash to pay the judgment.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we are engaged in 67 professional liability lawsuits. Although we work diligently to limit the cash required to settle and defend professional liability claims, a significant judgment entered against us in one or more legal actions could have a material adverse impact on our cash flows and could result in our being unable to meet all of our cash needs as they become due.\nThe U.S. Department of Justice has commenced a civil investigation of potential violations of the False Claims Act, which could adversely affect our operations and financial condition.\nOur business is currently under investigation for potential violations of the False Claims Act (FCA). See Legal Proceedings for further information regarding this investigation. Any finding that we are not in compliance with these laws could require us to change our operations or could subject us to treble damages, penalties and/or make us ineligible to participate in certain government funded healthcare programs, any of which could in turn significantly harm our business and financial condition.\nOur operational and strategic flexibility is limited due to the number of our centers that are leased from third parties.\nA substantial majority of our centers are leased from third parties. The loss or deterioration of our relationship with any of our landlords may adversely affect our business. The terms of such leases generally require us to operate such centers as skilled nursing centers, and generally do not allow us to assign the lease to a third party without the applicable landlord\u2019s consent. Therefore, our ability to divest such leased properties is limited, and we may be forced to continue operating such centers as skilled nursing centers even if doing so becomes unprofitable.\nWhile we expect to renew or extend our leases in the normal course of business, there can be no assurance that these rights will be exercised in the future or that we will be able to satisfy the conditions precedent to exercising any such renewal or extension, to the extent that such provisions exist in our leases. In addition, if we are unable to renew or extend any of our master leases, we may lose all of the facilities subject to that master lease agreement. If we are not able to renew or extend our leases at or prior to the end of the existing lease terms, or if the terms of such options are unfavorable or unacceptable to us, our business, financial condition and results of operation could be adversely affected.\nOur failure to pay the rent or otherwise comply with the provisions of any of our lease agreements could result in an \u201cevent of default\u201d under such lease agreement and also could result in a cross default under other master lease agreements and the agreements for our indebtedness. Upon an event of default, remedies available to our landlords generally include, without limitation, terminating such lease agreement, repossessing and reletting the leased properties and requiring us to remain liable for all obligations under such lease agreement, including the difference between the rent under such lease agreement and the rent payable as a result of reletting the leased properties, or requiring us to pay the net present value of the rent due for the balance of the term of such lease agreement. The exercise of such remedies would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nOur failure to pay rent or otherwise comply with the provisions of any of our Master Lease Agreements could materially adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.\nMany of our facilities are under a Master Lease Agreement. Our failure to pay the rent or otherwise comply with the provisions of any of our Master Lease Agreements would result in an \u201cEvent of Default\u201d under such Master Lease Agreement and also could result in a default under the Credit Facilities and, if repayment of the borrowings under the Credit Facilities were accelerated, also under the indentures governing our outstanding notes. The exercise of remedies by any of our landlords would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.\nWe are highly dependent on reimbursement by third-party payors and delays in reimbursement for any reason may cause liquidity problems.\nSubstantially all of our nursing center revenues are directly or indirectly dependent upon reimbursement from third-party payors, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and private insurers. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our patient revenues from continuing operations derived from Medicaid, Medicare, Managed Care and private pay (including private insurers) sources were approximately 50.6%, 27.5%, 6.8%, and 15.1%, respectively. Changes in the mix of our patients among Medicare, Medicaid, Managed Care and private pay categories and among different types of private pay sources may affect our net revenues and profitability. Our net revenues and profitability are also affected by the continuing efforts of all payors to contain or reduce the costs of health care. Efforts to impose reduced payments, greater discounts and more stringent cost controls by government and other payors are expected to continue.\nThe Federal Government makes frequent changes to the reimbursement provided under the Medicare program and future changes could significantly reduce the reimbursement we receive. Also, a number of state governments, including several of the states in which we operate, have announced projected budget shortfalls and/or deficit spending situations. Possible actions by these states include reductions of Medicaid reimbursement to providers such as us or the failure to increase Medicaid reimbursements to cover increased operating costs, or implementation of alternatives to long-term care, such as community and home-based services.\nAny changes in reimbursement levels or in the timing of payments under Medicare, Medicaid or private pay programs and any changes in applicable government regulations could have a material adverse effect on our net revenues, net income (loss) and cash flows. We are unable to predict what reform proposals or reimbursement limitations will be adopted in the future or the effect such changes will have on our operations. We are limited in our ability to reduce the direct costs of providing care when decreases in reimbursement rates are imposed. No assurance can be given that such reforms will not have a material adverse effect on us. See \u201cItem 1. Business - Government Regulation and Reimbursement.\u201d\nIf we have information systems problems or payment or other issues arise with Medicare, Medicaid or other payors that affect the amount or timeliness of reimbursements, we may encounter delays in our payment cycle. Any significant payment timing delay could cause us to experience working capital shortages. As a result, working capital management, including prompt and diligent billing and collection, is an important factor in our consolidated results of operations and liquidity. Our working capital management procedures may not successfully mitigate the effects of any delays in our receipt of payments or reimbursements. Accordingly, such delays could have an adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition.\nWe operate in an industry that is highly competitive.\nThe long-term care industry generally, and the nursing home business particularly, is highly competitive. We face direct competition for the acquisition of centers. In turn, our centers face competition for patients. Our ability to compete is based on several factors and include, but are not limited to building age, appearance, reputation, relationships with referral sources, availability of patients, survey history and CMS rankings. Some of our present and potential competitors are significantly larger and have or may obtain greater financial and marketing resources than we can. Some hospitals that provide long-term care services are also a potential source of competition. Certain of our competitors are operated by not-for-profit, non-taxpaying or governmental agencies that can finance capital expenditures on a tax exempt basis and receive funds and charitable contributions unavailable to us. In addition, we may encounter substantial competition from new market entrants. Consequently, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter increased competition in the future, which could limit our ability to attract patients or expand our business, and could materially and adversely affect our business or decrease our market share.\nWe may have difficulty attracting and retaining qualified nurses, therapists, healthcare professionals and other key personnel, which, along with a growing number of minimum wage and compensation related regulations, can increase our costs related to these employees.\nOur team members are essential to our business. We rely on our ability to attract and retain qualified nurses, therapists and other healthcare professionals. The market for these key personnel is highly competitive, and we could experience significant increases in our operating costs due to shortages in their availability. Like other healthcare providers, we have at times experienced difficulties in attracting and retaining qualified personnel. We may continue to experience increases in our labor costs, primarily due to higher wages and greater benefits required to attract and retain qualified healthcare personnel, and such increases may adversely affect our profitability. Furthermore, while we attempt to manage overall labor costs in the most efficient way, our efforts to manage them through wage freezes and similar means may have limited effectiveness and may lead to increased turnover and other challenges.\nTight labor markets and high demand for such team members can contribute to high turnover among clinical professional staff. A shortage of qualified personnel at a facility could result in significant increases in labor costs and increased reliance on overtime and expensive temporary staffing agencies, and could otherwise adversely affect operations at the affected centers. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified professionals, our ability to adequately provide services to our residents and patients may decline and our ability to grow may be constrained.\nOur cost of labor may be influenced by unanticipated factors in certain markets or, with respect to collective bargaining agreements that we are a party to, we may experience above-market increases. A substantial number of our team members are hourly team members whose wage rates are affected by increases in the federal or state minimum wage rate. As collective bargaining agreements are renegotiated or minimum wage rates increase we may need to increase the wages paid to team members. This may be applicable to not only minimum wage team members but also to team members at wage rates which are currently above the minimum wage.\nThe Department of Labor recently issued rule changes to the Fair Labor Standards Act that would increase the minimum salary threshold for team members exempt from overtime along with an automatic annual increase to this salary threshold. The future of these rule changes, as well as other potential changes, remains uncertain given the recent change in Presidential administrations. However, these rule changes could increase our cost of services provided.\nBecause we are largely funded by government programs, we do not have an ability to pass such wage increases through to revenue sources. Any such mandated wage increases could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nPossible changes in the acuity of residents and patients, as well as payor mix and payment methodologies, may significantly affect our profitability.\nThe sources and amount of our revenues are determined by a number of factors, including the occupancy rates of our facilities, the length of stay, the payor mix of residents and patients, rates of reimbursement among payors, and patient acuity. Changes in patient acuity as well as payor mix among private pay, Medicare, and Medicaid may significantly affect our profitability. In particular, any significant decrease in our population of high-acuity patients or any significant increase in our Medicaid population could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity, especially if state Medicaid programs continue to limit, or more aggressively seek limits on, reimbursement rates or service levels.\nOur systems are subject to security breaches and other cybersecurity incidents.\nWhile we maintain information technology security and safeguards, complex medical systems can be targeted for cyber attacks, and as a result, the potential exists for unauthorized parties to obtain access to our computer systems and networks. Such cyber attacks could result in the misappropriation of our patient information protected by privacy laws, private employee information, proprietary business information and technology or result in interruptions to our business. The reliability and security of our information technology infrastructure is critical to our business. To the extent that any disruptions or security breaches result in significant loss or damage to our data, or inappropriate disclosure of significant proprietary information, it could require notice to state and federal agencies of such a breach, cause damage to our reputation and affect our relationships with our patients, may result in civil and/or criminal fines and penalties or related class action litigation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe success of previous and future acquisitions cannot be guaranteed and such acquisitions may consume substantial capital and other resources and could expose us to unforeseen liabilities and integration risks.\nWe have in the past and plan to in the future make investments in additional centers, whether by opening new centers or acquiring existing centers. Such acquisitions may involve significant cash expenditures, debt incurrence, operating losses and additional expenses that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulties integrating acquired operations, personnel and accounting and information systems, or in realizing projected efficiencies and cost savings;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management's attention from other business concerns;\n\u2022\npotential loss of key team members or customers of acquired companies;\n\u2022\nentry into markets in which we may have limited or no experience;\n\u2022\nincreased indebtedness and reduced ability to access additional capital when needed;\n\u2022\nassumption of unknown liabilities or regulatory issues of acquired companies, including failure to comply with healthcare regulations or to establish internal financial controls; and\n\u2022\nstraining of our resources, including internal controls relating to information and accounting systems, regulatory compliance, logistics and others.\nFurthermore, certain of the foregoing risks could be exacerbated when combined with other growth measures that we may pursue.\nInvesting in our business initiatives and development could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe plan to invest in business initiatives and development that will increase our operating expenses. These initiatives may or may not be successful in growing our census or revenues. There is typically a time delay between incurring such expenses and the attaining of revenues and cash flows expected from these initiatives and development. As a result, our revenue and operating cash flow may not increase enough during a reporting period to cover these increased expenses. Such additional revenues may not materialize to the level we anticipate, if at all.\nDisasters and similar events may seriously harm our business.\nNatural and man-made disasters and similar events, including terrorist attacks and acts of nature such as hurricanes, tornados, earthquakes and wildfires, may cause damage or disruption to us, our employees and our centers, which could have an adverse impact on our patients and our business. In order to provide care for our patients, we are dependent on consistent and reliable delivery of food, pharmaceuticals, utilities and other goods to our centers, and the availability of employees to provide services at our centers. If the delivery of goods or the ability of employees to reach our centers were interrupted in any material respect due to a natural disaster or other reasons, it would have a significant impact on our centers and our business. Furthermore, the impact, or impending threat, of a natural disaster has in the past and may in the future require that we evacuate one or more centers, which would be costly and would involve risks, including potentially fatal risks, for the patients. The impact of disasters and similar events is inherently uncertain. Such events could harm our patients and employees, severely damage or destroy one or more of our centers, harm our business, reputation and financial performance, or otherwise cause our business to suffer in ways that we currently cannot predict.\nNew accounting pronouncements or new interpretations of existing standards could require us to make adjustments in our accounting policies that could affect our financial statements.\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC, or other accounting organizations or governmental entities issue new pronouncements or new interpretations of existing accounting standards that sometimes require us to change our accounting policies and procedures. Future pronouncements or interpretations could require us to change our policies or procedures and have a significant impact on our future financial statements.\nRisks Related to Government Regulations\nWe are subject to significant government regulation.\nThe health care industry is subject to numerous laws and regulations of federal, state and local governments. These laws and regulations include, but are not necessarily limited to, matters such as licensure, accreditation, government health care program participation requirements, protection of patient health information, reimbursement for patient services, quality of patient care and Medicare and Medicaid fraud and abuse. Various federal and state laws regulate relationships among providers of services, including employment or service contracts and investment relationships. The operation of long-term care centers and the provision of services are also subject to extensive federal, state, and local laws relating to, among other things, the adequacy of medical care, distribution of pharmaceuticals, equipment, personnel, operating policies, environmental compliance, compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act, fire prevention and compliance with building codes.\nLong-term care facilities are subject to periodic inspection to assure continued compliance with various standards and licensing requirements under state law, as well as with Medicare and Medicaid conditions of participation. The failure to obtain or renew any required regulatory approvals or licenses could adversely affect our growth and could prevent us from offering our existing or additional services. In addition, health care is an area of extensive and frequent regulatory change. Changes in the laws or new interpretations of existing laws can have a significant effect on methods and costs of doing business and amounts of payments received from governmental and other payors. Our operations could be adversely affected by, among other things, regulatory developments such as mandatory increases in the scope and quality of care to be afforded patients and revisions in licensing and certification standards. We attempt at all times to comply with all applicable laws; however, there can be no assurance that we will remain in compliance at all times with all applicable laws and regulations or that new legislation or administrative or judicial interpretation of existing laws or regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition. Federal or state proceedings seeking to impose fines and penalties for violations of applicable laws and regulations, as well as federal and state changes in these laws and regulations, may negatively impact us. See \u201cItem 1. Business - Government Regulation.\u201d See also \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings.\u201d\nThe health care industry has been the subject of increased regulatory scrutiny recently.\nThe Office of Inspector General (\u201cOIG\u201d), the enforcement arm of the Medicare and Medicaid programs, formulates a formal work plan each year for nursing centers. The OIG's most recent work plan indicates that quality of care, assessment and monitoring, poorly performing nursing facilities, hospitalizations, criminal background checks, Medicare part B services, accuracy of nursing facilities Minimum Data, transparency of ownership, and civil monetary penalty funds will be the investigative focus in 2017. We cannot predict the likelihood, scope or outcome of any such investigations on our centers.\nWe are subject to claims under the self-referral, false claims, and anti-kickback legislation.\nFederal and state false claims act statutes provide a mechanism for private individuals and governmental entities to seek to recover significant sums for alleged violations of the federal and state laws governing reimbursement for services provided. At least one false claims act case is pending against us, and there can be no assurance that our operations will not be subject to review, scrutiny, penalties or enforcement actions under these laws, or that these laws will not change in the future. Violations of these laws may result in substantial damage awards, civil or criminal penalties for individuals or entities, including large civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in the Medicare or Medicaid programs. Such awards, exclusion or penalties, if applied to us, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and profitability.\nIn the United States, various state and federal laws regulate the relationships between providers of health care services, physicians, and other clinicians. These self-referral laws impose restrictions on physician referrals for designated health services to entities with which they have financial relationships. These laws also prohibit the offering, payment, solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration in return for the referral of Medicare or state health care program patients or patient care opportunities for the purchase, lease or order of any item or service that is covered by the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Federal and state laws prohibit the submission of false claims and other acts that are considered fraudulent, wasteful or abusive. Under the federal False Claims Act (FCA), actions against a provider can be initiated by the federal government or by a private party on behalf of the federal government. These private parties, who are often referred to as \u201cqui tam relators\u201d or \u201crelators,\u201d are entitled to share in any amounts recovered by the government. Both direct enforcement activity by the government and qui tam relator actions have increased significantly in recent years. The use of private enforcement actions against healthcare providers has increased dramatically, in part because the relators are entitled to share in a portion of any settlement or judgment.\nA FCA violation occurs when a provider knowingly submits a claim for items or services not provided. The Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009 expanded the scope of the FCA by creating liability for knowingly retaining an overpayment received from the government and broadening protections for whistleblowers. The submission of false claims or the failure to timely repay overpayments may lead to the imposition of significant CMPs, significant criminal fines and imprisonment, and/or exclusion from participation in state and federally-funded healthcare programs, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs.\nAllegations of poor quality of care can also lead to FCA actions under a theory of worthless services. Worthless services cases allege that although care was provided it was so deficient that it was tantamount to no service at all.\nIn recent years, prosecutors and relators are increasingly bringing FCA claims based on the implied certification theory as an expansion of the scope of the FCA. Under the implied certification theory, a violation of the FCA occurs when a provider\u2019s request for payment implies a certification of compliance with the applicable statutes, regulations or contract provisions that are preconditions to payment. This development has increased the risk that a healthcare company will have to defend a false claims action, pay fines and treble damages or settlement amounts or be excluded from the federal and state healthcare programs as a result of an investigation arising out of the FCA. Many states have enacted similar laws providing for imposition of civil and criminal penalties for the filing of fraudulent claims.\nBecause we submit thousands of claims to Medicare each year, and there is a relatively long statute of limitations under the FCA, there is a risk that intentional, or even negligent or recklessly submitted claims that prove to be incorrect, or even billing errors, cost reporting errors or lapses in statutory or regulatory compliance with regard to the provision of healthcare services (including, without limitation the Anti-Kickback Statue and the federal self-referral law discussed above), could result in significant civil or criminal penalties against us. Any such penalties or allegations, whether valid or not, could have a significant impact on our business. To the extent that we, any of our centers through which we do business, or any of the owners or directors have a financial relationship with each other or with other health care entities providing services to long-term care patients, such relationships could be subject to increased scrutiny.\nWe are subject to laws governing the confidentiality of patient health information.\nBoth federal and state laws impose certain requirements regarding maintaining the confidentiality of patient health information. In particular, HIPAA rules and regulations require us to protect the medical records and other personal health information of our patients, limit our use of and ability to disclose such information except under certain circumstances, and give patients a right to access and amend their personal health information. A violation of HIPAA or any other federal or state laws regarding the confidentiality or use of such information could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, and could in turn damage our reputation, affect our ability to attract new patients, and thereby have a material adverse effect on our revenues, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nHealthcare reform legislation could adversely affect our revenue and financial condition.\nIn recent years, there have been initiatives on the federal and state levels for comprehensive reforms affecting the availability, payment and reimbursement of healthcare services in the United States. In March 2010, significant legislation concerning health care and health insurance was passed which will significantly change the future of health care in the United States, including the Affordable Care Act (the \u201cAffordable Care Act\u201d), which has affected comprehensive health insurance reform, including the creation of health insurance exchanges, among other reforms. However, as has been widely publicized, the Affordable Care Act has been fraught with challenges. In addition, it is possible that changes in administration and policy, including the potential repeal of all or parts of the Affordable Care Act, resulting from the recent U.S. presidential election could result in additional proposals and continued developments with respect to healthcare reform. Significant changes to, or repeal of, the Affordable Care Act or other healthcare legislation could materially and adversely our business.\nState efforts to regulate or deregulate the healthcare services industry or the construction or expansion of healthcare facilities could impair our ability to expand our operations, or could result in increased competition.\nSome states require healthcare providers to obtain prior approval, known as a certificate of need, for:\n\u2022 the purchase, construction or expansion of healthcare facilities;\n\u2022 capital expenditures exceeding a prescribed amount; or\n\u2022 changes in services or bed capacity.\nIn addition, other states that do not require certificates of need have effectively barred the expansion of existing facilities and the development of new ones by placing partial or complete moratoria on the number of new Medicaid beds they will certify in certain areas or in the entire state. Other states have established such stringent development standards and approval procedures for constructing new healthcare facilities that the construction of new facilities, or the expansion or renovation of existing facilities, may become cost prohibitive or extremely time-consuming. In addition, some states the acquisition of a facility being operated by a non-profit organization requires the approval of the state Attorney General.\nOur ability to acquire or construct new facilities or expand or provide new services at existing facilities would be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain the necessary approvals, if there are changes in the standards applicable to those approvals, or if we experience delays and increased expenses associated with obtaining those approvals. We may not be able to obtain licensure, certificate of need approval, Medicaid certification, Attorney General approval or other necessary approvals for future expansion projects. Conversely, the elimination or reduction of state regulations that limit the construction, expansion or renovation of new or existing facilities could result in increased competition to us or result in overbuilding of facilities in some of our markets. If overbuilding in the healthcare industry in the markets in which we operate were to occur, it could reduce the occupancy rates of existing facilities and, in some cases, might reduce the private rates that we charge for our services.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nOur ability and intent to pay cash dividends in the future may be limited.\nWe currently pay a $0.055 quarterly dividend on our common shares, and while the Board of Directors intends to pay quarterly dividends, the Board will make the determination of the amount of future cash dividends, if any, to be declared and paid based on, among other things, our financial condition, funds from operations, the level of our capital expenditures and future business prospects. The Company is restricted by its debt agreements in its ability to pay dividends.\nWe have a number of policies in place that could be considered anti-takeover protections.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation (the \u201cCertificate\u201d) provided for the classification of our Board into three classes, with each class of directors serving staggered terms of three years. Although the classification of our Board has been eliminated, all directors will not be up for election each year until the 2018 annual meeting. Our Certificate requires the approval of the holders of two-thirds of the outstanding shares to amend certain provisions of the Certificate. Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporate Law restricts the ability of a Delaware corporation to engage in any business combination with an interested shareholder. We are also authorized to issue up to 795,000 shares of preferred stock, the rights of which may be fixed by our Board without shareholder approval. Provisions in certain of our executive officers' employment agreements provide for post-termination compensation, including payment of amounts up to two times their annual salary, following certain changes in control (as defined in such agreements). Our stock incentive plans provide for the acceleration of the vesting of options in the event of certain changes in control (as defined in such plans). Certain changes in control\nalso constitute an event of default under our bank credit facility. The foregoing matters may, together or separately, have the effect of discouraging or making more difficult an acquisition or change of control of the company.", "PERMNO": 80587, "SIC": 8051, "TIC": "DVCR"}
