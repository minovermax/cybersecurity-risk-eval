Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information included in this report, in considering our business and prospects. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently deem insignificant, may also impair our business operations. The occurrence of any of the following risks could harm our business, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nIndex to Financial Statements Economic conditions may negatively impact demand for our products, which could adversely impact our sales and operating profit.\nThe willingness of our customers and consumers to purchase our products depends in part on economic conditions. In recent years, economic conditions were significantly strained in the United States. Continuing or worsening economic challenges could have a negative impact on our business. Economic uncertainty may result in increased pressure to reduce the prices of some of our products, limit our ability to increase or maintain prices, and reduce sales of higher margin products or shift our product mix to low-margin products. In addition, changes in tax or interest rates, whether due to recession, financial and credit market disruptions or other reasons, could negatively impact us. If any of these events occurs, or if unfavorable economic conditions continue or worsen, our sales and profitability could be adversely affected.\nIncreases in costs and/or shortages of raw materials, fuels and utilities could adversely impact our profitability.\nCommodities, such as flour, sweeteners, and shortening, which are used in our bakery products, are subject to price fluctuations. The cost of these inputs may fluctuate widely due to government policies and regulations, weather conditions, domestic and international demand, or other unforeseen circumstances. Any substantial change in the prices of raw materials may have an adverse impact on our profitability. We enter into forward purchase agreements and other derivative financial instruments from time to time to manage the impact of such volatility in raw materials prices; however, these strategies may not be adequate to overcome increases in market prices. Our failure to enter into effective hedging arrangements or any decrease in the availability or increase in the cost of these agreements and instruments could increase the price of these raw materials and significantly affect our earnings.\nIn addition, we are dependent upon natural gas or propane for firing ovens. Our independent distributors and third-party shipping companies are dependent upon gasoline and diesel for their vehicles. The cost of fuel may fluctuate widely due to economic and political conditions, government policy and regulation, war, or other unforeseen circumstances. Substantial future increases in prices for, or shortages of, these fuels could have a material adverse effect on our profitability, financial condition or results of operations. There can be no assurance that we can cover these cost increases through future pricing actions. Also, as a result of these pricing actions, consumers could purchase less or move from purchasing high-margin products to lower-margin products.\nCompetition could adversely impact revenues and profitability.\nThe United States bakery industry is highly competitive. Our principal competitors in these categories all have substantial financial, marketing, and other resources. In most product categories, we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products, but also with store branded products that are generally sold at lower prices. Competition is based on product availability, product quality, price, effective promotions, and the ability to target changing consumer preferences. We experience price pressure from time to time due to competitors\u2019 promotional activity and other pricing efforts. This pricing pressure is particularly strong during adverse economic periods. Increased competition could result in reduced sales, margins, profits and market share.\nThe costs of maintaining and enhancing the value and awareness of our brands are increasing, which could have an adverse impact on our revenues and profitability.\nWe rely on the success of our well-recognized brand names and we intend to maintain our strong brand recognition by continuing to devote resources to advertising, marketing and other brand building efforts. Brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors, including consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner, adverse publicity about our products (whether or not valid), our failure to maintain the quality of our products, the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences, or the products becoming unavailable to consumers. Our marketing investments may not prove successful in maintaining or increasing our market share. If we are not able to successfully maintain our brand recognition, our revenues and profitability could be adversely affected.\nIndex to Financial Statements We rely on several large customers for a significant portion of our sales and the loss of one of our large customers could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have several large customers that account for a significant portion of our sales, and the loss of one of our large customers could adversely affect our results of operations. Our top ten customers accounted for 43.9% of our sales during fiscal 2014. Our largest customer, Walmart/Sam\u2019s Club, accounted for 19.5% of our sales during this period. These customers do not typically enter into long-term sales contracts, and instead make purchase decisions based on a combination of price, product quality, consumer demand, and customer service performance. At any time, they may use more of their shelf space, including space currently used for our products, for store branded products or for products from other suppliers. Additionally, our customers may face financial or other difficulties that may impact their operations and their purchases from us. Disputes with significant suppliers could also adversely affect our ability to supply products to our customers. If our sales to one or more of these customers are reduced, this reduction may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nInability to anticipate or respond to changes in consumer preferences may result in decreased demand for our products, which could have an adverse impact on our future growth and operating results.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to respond to current market trends and to anticipate the tastes and dietary habits of consumers, including concerns of consumers regarding health and wellness, obesity, product attributes, and ingredients. Introduction of new products and product extensions requires significant development and marketing investment. If our products fail to meet consumer preferences, or we fail to introduce new and improved products on a timely basis, then the return on that investment will be less than anticipated and our strategy to grow sales and profits with investments in marketing and innovation will be less successful. If we fail to anticipate, identify, or react to changes in consumer preferences, or we fail to introduce new or improved products on a timely basis we could experience reduced demand for our products, which could in turn cause our operating results to suffer.\nWe may be adversely impacted by the failure to successfully execute acquisitions and divestitures and integrate acquired operations.\nFrom time to time, the company undertakes acquisitions or divestitures. In fiscal 2013, we acquired the Acquired Hostess Bread Assets, certain assets and the Sara Lee trademark licenses from BBU in California, and certain assets related to a bun line in Modesto, California. The success of these acquisitions, or any other acquisition or divestiture depends on the company\u2019s ability to identify opportunities that help us meet our strategic objectives, consummate a transaction on favorable contractual terms, and achieve expected returns and other financial benefits.\nAcquisitions, including our recent acquisitions, require us to efficiently integrate the acquired business or businesses, which involves a significant degree of difficulty, including the following:\n\u2022\nintegrating the operations of the acquired businesses while carrying on the ongoing operations of the businesses we operated prior to the acquisitions;\n\u2022\nmanaging a significantly larger company than before consummation of the acquisitions;\n\u2022\nthe possibility of faulty assumptions underlying our expectations regarding the integration process;\n\u2022\ncoordinating a greater number of diverse businesses and businesses located in a greater number of geographic locations;\n\u2022\nintegrating different business cultures;\n\u2022\nattracting and retaining the necessary personnel associated with the acquisitions;\n\u2022\ncreating uniform standards, controls, procedures, policies and information systems and controlling the costs associated with such matters; and\n\u2022\nintegrating information, purchasing, accounting, finance, sales, billing, payroll and regulatory compliance systems.\nIndex to Financial Statements Divestitures have operational risks that may include impairment charges. Divestitures also present unique financial and operational risks, including diversion of management attention from the existing core business, separating personnel and financial data and other systems, and adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers.\nIn situations where acquisitions or divestitures are not successfully implemented or completed, the company\u2019s business or financial results could be negatively impacted.\nThis risk includes our expectations about the performance of acquired trademarks and brands. If we are unable to implement our growth strategies for these acquired intangible assets as expected, it could adversely impact the carrying value of the acquired brands. The fair value of the trademarks could be less than our carrying value if any of our four material assumptions in our fair value analysis: (a) weighted average cost of capital; (b) long-term sales growth rates; (c) forecasted operating margins; and (d) market multiples do not meet our expectations, thereby requiring us to record an asset impairment.\nConsolidation in the retail and foodservice industries could affect our sales and profitability.\nIf our retail and foodservice customers continue to grow larger due to consolidation in their respective industries, they may demand lower pricing and increased promotional programs. Meeting these demands could adversely affect our sales and profitability.\nOur large customers may impose requirements on us that may adversely affect our results of operations.\nFrom time to time, our large customers may re-evaluate or refine their business practices and impose new or revised requirements on us and their other suppliers. The growth of large mass merchandisers, supercenters and dollar stores, together with changes in consumer shopping patterns, have produced large, sophisticated customers with increased buying power and negotiating strength. Current trends among retailers and foodservice customers include fostering high levels of competition among suppliers, demanding new products or increased promotional programs, requiring suppliers to maintain or reduce product prices, and requiring product delivery with shorter lead times. These business changes may involve inventory practices, logistics, or other aspects of the customer- supplier relationship. Compliance with requirements imposed by major customers may be costly and may have an adverse effect on our margins and profitability. However, if we fail to meet a significant customer\u2019s demands, we could lose that customer\u2019s business, which also could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur inability to execute our business strategy could adversely affect our business.\nWe employ various operating strategies to maintain our position as one of the nation\u2019s leading producers and marketers of bakery products available to customers through multiple channels of distribution. If we are unsuccessful in implementing or executing one or more of these strategies, our business could be adversely affected.\nIncreases in employee and employee-related costs could have adverse effects on our profitability.\nPension, health care, and workers\u2019 compensation costs are increasing and will likely continue to do so. Any substantial increase in pension, health care or workers\u2019 compensation costs may have an adverse impact on our profitability. The company records pension costs and the liabilities related to its benefit plans based on actuarial valuations, which include key assumptions determined by management. Material changes in pension costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions. Future annual amounts could be impacted by various factors, such as changes in the number of plan participants, changes in the discount rate, changes in the expected long-term rate of return, changes in the level of contributions to the plan, and other factors. In addition, legislation or regulations involving labor and employment and employee benefit plans (including employee health care benefits and costs) may impact our operational results.\nWe have risks related to our pension plans, which could impact the company\u2019s liquidity.\nThe company has trusteed, noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering certain employees maintained under the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\u201cERISA\u201d). The funding\nIndex to Financial Statements\nobligations for our pension plans are impacted by the performance of the financial markets, including the performance of our common stock, which comprises approximately 10.3% of all the pension plan assets as of January 3, 2015.\nIf the financial markets do not provide the long-term returns that are expected, the likelihood of the company being required to make larger contributions will increase which could impact our liquidity. The equity markets can be, and recently have been, very volatile, and therefore our estimate of future contribution requirements can change dramatically in relatively short periods of time. Similarly, changes in interest rates can impact our contribution requirements. In a low interest rate environment, the likelihood of larger required contributions increases. Adverse developments in any of these areas could adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nA disruption in the operation of our DSD distribution system could negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe believe that our DSD distribution system is a significant competitive advantage. A material negative change in our relationship with the independent distributors, an adverse ruling by regulatory or governmental bodies regarding our independent distributorship program or an adverse judgment against the company for actions taken by the independent distributors could materially affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nDisruption in our supply chain or distribution capabilities from political instability, armed hostilities, incidents of terrorism, natural disasters, weather or labor strikes could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to make, move and sell products is critical to our success. Damage or disruption to our manufacturing or distribution capabilities, or the manufacturing or distribution capabilities of our suppliers due to weather, natural disaster, fire or explosion, terrorism, pandemics or labor strikes, could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products. Moreover, terrorist activity, armed conflict, political instability or natural disasters that may occur within or outside the U.S. may disrupt manufacturing, labor, and other business operations. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, could adversely affect our business, financial conditions and results of operations.\nFuture product recalls or safety concerns could adversely impact our results of operations.\nWe may be required to recall certain of our products should they be mislabeled, contaminated, spoiled, tampered with or damaged. We also may become involved in lawsuits and legal proceedings if it is alleged that the consumption of any of our products causes injury, illness or death. A product recall or an adverse result in any such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our operating and financial results, depending on the costs of the recall, the destruction of product inventory, competitive reaction and consumer attitudes. Even if a product liability or consumer fraud claim is unsuccessful or without merit, the negative publicity surrounding such assertions regarding our products could adversely affect our reputation and brand image. We also could be adversely affected if consumers in our principal markets lose confidence in the safety and quality of our products.\nWe may be adversely impacted if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately, including with respect to cybersecurity issues.\nThe efficient operation of our business depends on our information technology systems. We rely on our information technology systems to effectively manage our business data, communications, supply chain, order entry and fulfillment, and other business processes. The failure of our information technology systems (including those provided to us by third parties) to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and could result in billing, collecting, and ordering errors, processing inefficiencies, and the loss of sales and customers, causing our business and results of operations to suffer. In addition, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from circumstances beyond our control, including fire, natural disasters, systems failures,\nIndex to Financial Statements\nsecurity breaches or intrusions (including theft of customer, consumer or other confidential data), and viruses. Any such damage or interruption could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial results.\nGovernment regulation could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nAs a producer and marketer of food items, our production processes, product quality, packaging, labeling, storage, and distribution are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local government entities and agencies. Failure to comply with, or violations of, the regulatory requirements of one or more of these agencies can result in a variety of sanctions, including monetary fines or compulsory withdrawal of products from store shelves, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the marketing of food products has come under increased scrutiny in recent years, and the food industry has been subject to an increasing number of legal proceedings and claims relating to alleged false or deceptive marketing under federal, state or local laws or regulations. Legal proceedings or claims related to our marketing could damage our reputation and/or adversely affect our business or financial results.\nClimate change or changes in or new interpretations of applicable laws or regulations involving government regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions may result in increased compliance costs, capital expenditures, and other financial obligations that could affect our profitability or impede the production or distribution of our products and have an adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nThere is growing concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns, and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. In the event that such climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivity, we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products, such as corn, wheat, and soybeans. We may also be subjected to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for water as a result of such change, which could impact our manufacturing and distribution operations. In addition, natural disasters and extreme weather conditions may disrupt the productivity of our facilities or the operation of our supply chain.\nThe increasing concern over climate change also may result in more regional, federal, and/or global legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases. We use natural gas, diesel fuel, and electricity in the manufacturing and distribution of our products. Legislation or regulation affecting these inputs could materially affect our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition since they could affect our ability to procure our commodity needs at costs we currently experience and may require additional unplanned capital expenditures. In the event that such regulation is enacted and is more aggressive than the sustainability measures that we are currently undertaking to monitor our emissions and improve our energy efficiency, we may experience significant increases in our costs of operation and delivery.\nFailure to maximize or to successfully assert our intellectual property rights could impact our competitiveness.\nWe rely on trademark, trade secret, patent and copyright laws to protect our intellectual property rights. We cannot be sure that these intellectual property rights will be maximized or that they can be successfully asserted. There is a risk that we will not be able to obtain and perfect our own or, where appropriate, license intellectual property rights necessary to support new product introductions. We cannot be sure that these rights, if obtained, will not be invalidated, circumvented or challenged in the future. Our failure to perfect or successfully assert our intellectual property rights could make us less competitive and could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur articles of incorporation and bylaws, and Georgia law may inhibit a change in control that you may favor.\nOur articles of incorporation and bylaws, and Georgia law contain provisions that may delay, deter or inhibit any possible future acquisition of our company if not approved by our Board of Directors. This could occur even if our shareholders are offered an attractive value for their shares or if a substantial number or even a majority of\nIndex to Financial Statements\nour shareholders believe the takeover is in their best interest. These provisions are intended to encourage any person interested in acquiring us to negotiate with and obtain the approval of our Board of Directors in connection with the transaction. Provisions in our organizational documents that could delay, deter or inhibit a future acquisition include the following:\n\u2022\nA classified Board of Directors, subject to the Board of Directors determination, on November 21, 2014, to seek shareholder approval of a proposal to declassify its board of directors at the 2015 Annual Meeting of Shareholders;\n\u2022\nThe requirement that our shareholders may only remove directors for cause;\n\u2022\nSpecified requirements for calling special meetings of shareholders;\n\u2022\nThe ability to issue preferred stock, which would be issued with voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to our common stock; and\n\u2022\nThe ability of the Board of Directors to consider the interests of various constituencies, including our employees, customers, creditors, and the local community.\n* On November 21, 2014, the Board of Directors determined that the company will seek shareholder approval of a proposal to declassify its board of directors at the 2015 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.\nOur articles of incorporation also permit the Board of Directors to issue shares of preferred stock with such designations, powers, preferences and rights as it determines, without any further vote or action by our shareholders.\nExecutive Offices\nThe address and telephone number of our principal executive offices are 1919 Flowers Circle, Thomasville, Georgia 31757, (229) 226-9110.\nExecutive Officers of Flowers Foods\nThe following table sets forth certain information regarding the persons who currently serve as the executive officers of Flowers Foods.
