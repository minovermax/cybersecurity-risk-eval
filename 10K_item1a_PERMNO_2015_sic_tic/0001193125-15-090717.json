{"cik": "1580905", "company": "Installed Building Products, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-13", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThere are a number of business risks and uncertainties that could affect our business. These risks and uncertainties could cause our actual results to differ from past performance or expected results. We consider the following risks and uncertainties to be most relevant to our business activities. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently believe to be immaterial, also may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. We urge investors to consider carefully the risk factors described below in evaluating the information contained in this report.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS\nOur business is dependent on the U.S. residential construction industry, economy, credit markets and other important factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nWe are highly dependent on the level of new home construction, which in turn is dependent upon a number of factors, including interest rates, consumer confidence, employment rates, foreclosure rates, housing inventory levels, housing demand and the health of the economy and mortgage markets. Unfavorable changes in demographics, credit markets, political conditions, consumer confidence, household formation, housing affordability or housing inventory levels, or a weakening of the national economy or of any regional or local economy in which we operate, could adversely affect consumer spending, result in decreased demand for homes and adversely affect our business. Additional headwinds may come from the efforts and proposals of lawmakers to reduce the debt of the federal government and/or solve state budget shortfalls through tax increases and/or spending cuts, and financial markets\u2019 and businesses\u2019 reactions to those efforts and proposals, which could impair economic growth.\nThe housing market recovery faces significant challenges.\nWhile some of the challenges facing the housing market first showed signs of moderating in 2012, several remain, and these challenges could return and/or intensify to limit the extent of any recovery of or future improvement in housing market conditions. These challenges include (i) weak general economic and employment growth that, among other things, limits consumer incomes, consumer confidence and demand for homes; (ii) elevated levels of mortgage loan delinquencies, defaults and foreclosures that could add to an inventory of lender-owned homes that may be sold in competition with new and resale homes at low distressed prices or that generate short sales activity at such price levels; (iii) a significant number of homeowners whose outstanding principal balance on their mortgage loan exceeds the market value of their home, which undermines their ability to purchase another home that they otherwise might desire and be able to afford; (iv) volatility and uncertainty in U.S. financial, credit and consumer lending markets amid slow growth or recessionary conditions; and (v) tight lending standards and practices for mortgage loans that limit consumers\u2019 ability to qualify for mortgage financing to purchase a home, including increased minimum credit score requirements, credit risk/mortgage loan insurance premiums and/or other fees and required down payment amounts, more conservative appraisals, higher loan-to-value ratios and extensive buyer income and asset documentation requirements. Given these factors, the present housing recovery may not continue or gain further momentum or return to the historic levels and mix of single-family and multi-family new home construction activity, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe present housing recovery is relative to the historically low levels of home sales and residential new construction activity experienced during the recent housing downturn. Even with the upturn, which first showed\nsigns of moderating in 2012, new home construction remains well below, and may not return to, the peak levels reached shortly before the housing downturn began in 2006. In addition, we operate in certain markets where new home construction lags the housing recovery. If the present new home construction recovery stalls or does not continue at the same pace, or any or all of the negative factors described above persist or worsen, there would likely be a corresponding adverse effect on the new home construction market, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial statements, including, but not limited to, the amount of revenues we generate and our ability to operate profitably.\nA decline in the economy and a deterioration in expectations regarding the housing recovery could result in our taking additional significant non-cash impairment charges, which could negatively affect our earnings and reduce stockholders\u2019 equity.\nAnnually, we assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. This assessment had led to impairment of goodwill in years prior to 2012. We did not record any goodwill impairment charges in 2014, 2013, or 2012; however, a decline in the expectation of our future performance or deterioration in expectations regarding the timing and the extent of the recovery of new home construction and home improvement may cause us to recognize additional non-cash, pre-tax impairment charges for goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets or other long-lived assets, which are not determinable at this time. In addition, as a result of our acquisition strategy, we have recorded additional goodwill and may incur impairment charges in connection with prior and future acquisitions. If the value of goodwill or other intangible assets is impaired, our earnings and stockholders\u2019 equity would be adversely affected. In addition, if future acquisitions are not successful, we may record additional unexpected impairment charges.\nOur business is cyclical and significantly affected by changes in general and local economic conditions.\nDemand for our services is cyclical and highly sensitive to general and local economic conditions over which we have no control, including changes in:\n\u2022\nthe number of new home and commercial building construction starts;\n\u2022\nshort- and long -term interest rates;\n\u2022\ninflation;\n\u2022\nemployment levels and job and personal income growth;\n\u2022\nhousing demand from population growth, household formation and other demographic changes;\n\u2022\navailability and pricing of mortgage financing for homebuyers and commercial financing for developers of multi-family homes and subcontractors;\n\u2022\nconsumer confidence generally and the confidence of potential homebuyers in particular;\n\u2022\nU.S. and global financial system and credit market stability;\n\u2022\nprivate party and government mortgage loan programs and federal and state regulation, oversight and legal action regarding lending, appraisal, foreclosure and short sale practices;\n\u2022\nfederal and state personal income tax rates and provisions, including provisions for the deduction of mortgage loan interest payments, real estate taxes and other expenses; and\n\u2022\nfederal, state and local energy efficiency programs, regulations, codes and standards.\nAdverse changes in these conditions may affect our business generally or may be more prevalent or concentrated in particular markets in which we operate. Any deterioration in economic conditions or continuation of uncertain economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur business may be affected by severe weather conditions and is seasonal.\nSevere weather conditions, such as unusually prolonged cold conditions, rain, blizzards or hurricanes, could accelerate, delay or halt construction or installation activity. The impact of these types of events on our business may adversely impact our net revenue, cash flows from operations and results of operations. If net revenue were to fall substantially below what we would normally expect during certain periods, our financial results for those periods would be adversely impacted.\nWe tend to have higher sales during the second half of the year as our homebuilder customers complete construction of homes placed under contract for sale in the traditionally stronger spring selling season. In addition, some of our larger branches operate in states impacted by winter weather and, as such, experience a slowdown in construction activity during the first quarter of the calendar year. This winter slowdown contributes to traditionally lower sales in our first quarter.\nOur industry is highly fragmented and competitive, and increased competitive pressure may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe building products installation industry is highly fragmented and competitive. We face significant competition from other national, regional and local companies. Any of these competitors may (i) foresee the course of market development more accurately than we do; (ii) offer services that are deemed superior to ours; (iii) install building products at a lower cost; (iv) develop stronger relationships with homebuilders and suppliers; (v) adapt more quickly to new technologies, new installation techniques or evolving customer requirements; or (vi) have access to financing on more favorable terms than we can obtain in the market. As a result, we may not be able to compete successfully with them. If we are unable to compete effectively, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nIn the event that increased demand leads to higher prices for the products we install, due to the fragmented and competitive nature of our industry, we may have limited, if any, ability to pass on price increases in a timely manner or at all. In the past, we have generally been able to pass on these increases to our customers over time.\nProduct shortages or the loss of key suppliers could affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur ability to offer a wide variety of products to our customers is dependent upon our ability to obtain adequate product supply from manufacturers. We do not typically enter into long-term agreements with our suppliers but have done so from time to time. See Note 11, Commitments and Contingencies, Supply Contract Commitments, to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for additional information regarding commitments and contingencies. Generally, our products are available from various sources and in sufficient quantities. However, the loss of, or a substantial decrease in the availability of, products from our suppliers or the loss of key supplier arrangements could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In prior downturns in the housing industry, manufacturers have reduced capacity by closing plants and production lines within plants. Even if such capacity reductions are not permanent, there may be a delay in manufacturers\u2019 ability to increase capacity in times of rising demand. If the demand for products from manufacturers and other suppliers exceeds the available supply, we may be unable to source additional products in sufficient quantity or quality in a timely manner and the prices for the products that we install could rise. These developments could affect our ability to take advantage of market opportunities and limit our growth prospects. Our three largest suppliers in aggregate accounted for approximately 47% of our material purchases for the year ended December 31, 2014. We continually evaluate our supplier relationships and at any given time may move some or all of our purchases from one or more of our suppliers. There can be no assurance that any such action would have its intended effect.\nFailure by our suppliers to continue to provide us with products on commercially favorable terms, or at all, could put pressure on our operating margins or have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating results and/or cash flows. Our inability to source materials in a timely manner could also damage our relationships with our customers.\nChanges in the costs of the products we install can decrease our profit margins.\nThe principal building products that we install have been subject to price changes in the past, some of which have been significant. Our results of operations for individual quarters can be and have been hurt by a delay between the time building product cost increases are implemented and the time we are able to increase prices for our products, if at all. Our supplier purchase prices often depend on volume requirements. If we do not meet these volume requirements, our costs could increase and our margins may be adversely affected. In addition, while we have been able to achieve cost savings through volume purchasing and our relationships with suppliers, we may not be able to continue to receive advantageous pricing for the products that we install, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may be unable to successfully acquire and integrate other businesses.\nWe may be unable to continue to grow our business through acquisitions. We may not be able to continue to identify suitable acquisition candidates and may face increased competition for these acquisition candidates. In addition, acquired businesses may not perform in accordance with expectations, and our business judgments concerning the value, strengths and weaknesses of acquired businesses may not prove to be correct. We may also be unable to achieve expected improvements or achievements in businesses that we acquire. At any given time, including currently, we may be evaluating or in discussions with one or more acquisition candidates, including entering into non-binding letters of intent. Future acquisitions may result in the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, legal liabilities, goodwill impairments, increased interest expense and amortization expense and significant integration costs.\nAcquisitions involve a number of special risks, including:\n\u2022\nour inability to manage acquired businesses or control integration costs and other costs relating to acquisitions;\n\u2022\npotential adverse short-term effects on operating results from increased costs or otherwise;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention;\n\u2022\nfailure to retain existing key personnel of the acquired business and recruit qualified new employees at the location;\n\u2022\nfailure to successfully implement infrastructure, logistics and systems integration;\n\u2022\npotential impairment of goodwill;\n\u2022\nrisks associated with the internal controls of acquired companies;\n\u2022\nexposure to legal claims for activities of the acquired business prior to acquisition and inability to realize on any indemnification claims, including with respect to environmental and immigration claims;\n\u2022\nthe risks inherent in the systems of the acquired business and risks associated with unanticipated events or liabilities; and\n\u2022\nour inability to obtain financing necessary to complete acquisitions on attractive terms or at all.\nOur strategy could be impeded if we do not identify, or face increased competition for, suitable acquisition candidates and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected if any of the foregoing factors were to occur.\nWe may be subject to claims arising from the operations of our various businesses for periods prior to the dates we acquired them.\nWe have consummated over 90 acquisitions. We may be subject to claims or liabilities arising from the ownership or operation of acquired businesses for the periods prior to our acquisition of them, including environmental, employee-related and other liabilities and claims not covered by insurance. These claims or liabilities could be significant. Our ability to seek indemnification from the former owners of our acquired businesses for these claims or liabilities may be limited by various factors, including the specific time, monetary or other limitations contained in the respective acquisition agreements and the financial ability of the former owners to satisfy our indemnification claims. In addition, insurance companies may be unwilling to cover claims that have arisen from acquired businesses or locations, or claims may exceed the coverage limits that our acquired businesses had in effect prior to the date of acquisition. If we are unable to successfully obtain insurance coverage of third-party claims or enforce our indemnification rights against the former owners, or if the former owners are unable to satisfy their obligations for any reason, including because of their current financial position, we could be held liable for the costs or obligations associated with such claims or liabilities, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success depends on our key personnel.\nOur business results depend largely upon the continued contributions of our Chief Executive Officer and other members of our management team. We do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers, other than Jeff Edwards, the Chairman of our Board and our Chief Executive Officer and President. Although our employment agreement, dated November 1, 2013, with Mr. Edwards provides for a three-year term, he is permitted under the agreement to resign his employment at any time with only 30 days\u2019 prior written notice to us. Also, while his employment agreement requires Mr. Edwards to devote the amount of time necessary to conduct our business and affairs, he is also permitted to engage in other business activities that do not create a conflict of interest or substantially interfere with his service to us, including non-competitive operational activities for his real estate development business. See \u201cCompensation of Our Executive Officers and Directors - Compensation of Our Executive Officers - Employment Agreement with Jeff Edwards.\u201d Although we maintain key person life insurance on Mr. Edwards, if he no longer serves in (or serves in some lesser capacity than) his current role, or if we lose other members of our management team, our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as the market price of our securities, could be adversely affected.\nOur business results also depend upon our branch managers and sales personnel, including those of companies recently acquired. While we customarily sign non-competition agreements, typically lasting two years post- employment, with our branch managers and sales personnel in order to maintain key customer relationships in our markets, such agreements do not protect us fully against competition from former employees.\nWe are dependent on attracting, training and retaining qualified employees while controlling labor costs.\nWe must attract, train and retain a large number of qualified employees while controlling related labor costs. We compete with other businesses for these employees. Tighter labor markets, due to a recovering housing market or otherwise, may make it more difficult for us to hire and retain installers and control labor costs. Our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including competitive wage rates and health and other insurance costs. In addition, changes in the federal or state minimum wage or living wage requirements or changes in other workplace regulations could adversely affect our ability to meet our financial targets.\nHigher health care costs and labor costs could adversely affect our business.\nWith the passage in 2010 of the U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or the Affordable Care Act, we are required to provide affordable coverage, as defined in the Affordable Care Act, to all employees, or otherwise be subject to a payment per employee based on the affordability criteria therein. Many of these requirements will\nbe phased in over a period of time, some having already become effective this past year with others set to become effective in 2015. We anticipate that as these requirements continue to become effective, we could experience higher health care and labor costs in the future. Additionally, some states and localities have passed state and local laws mandating the provision of certain levels of health benefits by some employers. Increased health care and insurance costs could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition changes in federal or state workplace regulations could adversely affect our ability to meet our financial targets.\nChanges in employment laws may adversely affect our business.\nVarious federal and state labor laws govern the relationship with our employees and impact operating costs. These laws include:\n\u2022\nemployee classification as exempt or non-exempt for overtime and other purposes;\n\u2022\nminimum wage requirements;\n\u2022\nunemployment tax rates;\n\u2022\nworkers\u2019 compensation rates;\n\u2022\nimmigration status;\n\u2022\nmandatory health benefits;\n\u2022\npaid leaves of absence, including paid sick leave;\n\u2022\ntax reporting; and\n\u2022\nother wage and benefit requirements.\nSignificant additional government-imposed increases in the preceding areas could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, various states in which we operate are considering or have already adopted new immigration laws or enforcement programs, and the U.S. Congress and Department of Homeland Security from time to time consider and may implement changes to federal immigration laws, regulations or enforcement programs as well. Some of these changes may increase our obligations for compliance and oversight, which could subject us to additional costs and make our hiring process more cumbersome, or reduce the availability of potential employees. Although we verify the employment eligibility status of all our employees, including through participation in the \u201cE-Verify\u201d program where required, some of our employees may, without our knowledge, be unauthorized workers. However, use of the \u201cE-Verify\u201d program does not guarantee that we will properly identify all applicants who are ineligible for employment. Unauthorized workers are subject to deportation and may subject us to fines or penalties, and if any of our workers are found to be unauthorized we could experience adverse publicity that negatively impacts our brand and may make it more difficult to hire and keep qualified employees. Termination of a significant number of employees who were unauthorized employees may disrupt our operations, cause temporary increases in our labor costs as we train new employees and result in additional adverse publicity. We could also become subject to fines, penalties and other costs related to claims that we did not fully comply with all recordkeeping obligations of federal and state immigration compliance laws. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to periodic litigation and regulatory proceedings, including Fair Labor Standards Act and state wage and hour class action lawsuits, which may adversely affect our business and financial performance.\nFrom time to time, we may be involved in lawsuits and regulatory actions, including class action lawsuits that are brought or threatened against us for alleged violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act, or the FLSA, and state\nwage and hour laws. See Note 11, Commitments and Contingencies, to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2014 included in Item 8 of Part II of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding commitments and contingencies.\nThe nature of our business exposes us to product liability, workmanship warranty, casualty, construction defect, breach of contract and other claims and legal proceedings.\nWe are subject to product liability, workmanship warranty, casualty, construction defect, breach of contract and other claims relating to the products we install that, if adversely determined, could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We rely on manufacturers and other suppliers to provide us with most of the products we install. Because we do not have direct control over the quality of such products manufactured or supplied by such third-party suppliers, we are exposed to risks relating to the quality of such products. In addition, we are exposed to potential claims arising from the conduct of our employees, and homebuilders and other subcontractors, for which we may be contractually liable. Certain types of insulation, particularly spray foam applications, require our employees to handle potentially hazardous or toxic substances. While our employees who handle these and other potentially hazardous or toxic materials, including lead-based paint, receive specialized training and wear protective clothing, there is still a risk that they, or others, may be exposed to these substances. Exposure to these substances could result in significant injury to our employees and others, including site occupants, and damage to our property or the property of others, including natural resource damage. Our personnel and others at our work sites are also at risk for other workplace-related injuries, including slips and falls.\nWe have in the past been, and may in the future be, subject to fines, penalties and other liabilities in connection with any such injury or damage. Although we currently maintain what we believe to be suitable and adequate insurance in excess of our self-insured amounts, we may be unable to maintain such insurance on acceptable terms or such insurance may not provide adequate protection against potential liabilities.\nProduct liability, workmanship warranty, casualty, negligence, construction defect, breach of contract and other claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for significant periods of time, regardless of the ultimate outcome. In addition, lawsuits relating to construction defects typically have statutes of limitations that can run as long as ten years. Claims of this nature could also have a negative impact on customer confidence in us and our services. In addition, we are subject to various claims and lawsuits incidental to the conduct of our business in the ordinary course. Current or future claims could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. We may also be unable to obtain performance and licensing bonds on commercially reasonable terms or at all in the future. Surety companies issue bonds on a project-by-project basis and can decline to issue bonds at any time. Our inability to obtain such bonds would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. For additional information, see Note 11, Commitments and Contingencies, to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2014 included in Item 8 of Part II of this Form 10-K.\nFederal, state, local and other laws and regulations could impose substantial costs and/or restrictions on our operations that would reduce our net income.\nWe are subject to various federal, state, local and other laws and regulations, including, among other things, worker and workplace health and safety regulations promulgated by the DOT and employment regulations promulgated by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. More burdensome regulatory requirements in these or other areas may increase our expenses and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Moreover, failure to comply with the regulatory requirements applicable to our business could expose us to substantial fines and penalties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur transportation operations, upon which we depend to transport materials from our locations to job sites, are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the DOT. The DOT has broad administrative powers with respect to our transportation operations. More restrictive limitations on vehicle weight and size, trailer length and configuration or driver hours of service would increase our costs, which, if we are unable to pass these cost increases on to our customers, may increase our expenses and adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and/or cash flows. If we fail to comply adequately with DOT regulations or regulations become more stringent, we could experience increased inspections, regulatory authorities could take remedial action including imposing fines or shutting down our operations and we could be subject to increased audit and compliance costs. We organize our transportation operations as a separate legal entity in certain states, including in Ohio and Indiana, in order to take advantage of sales tax exemptions relating to vehicle operating costs. If legislation is enacted that modifies or eliminates these exemptions, our costs may increase. If any of these events were to occur, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nIn addition, the residential construction industry is subject to various federal, state and local statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning zoning, building design and safety, construction, contractors\u2019 licensing, energy conservation and similar matters, including regulations that impose restrictive zoning and density requirements on the residential new construction industry or that limit the number of homes that can be built within the boundaries of a particular area. Regulatory restrictions and industry standards may require us to alter our installation processes and our sourcing and otherwise increase our operating expenses and limit the availability of suitable building lots for our customers, any of which could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to environmental regulation and potential exposure to environmental liabilities.\nWe are subject to various federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations. Although we believe that we operate our business, including each of our locations, in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations and maintain all material permits required under such laws and regulations to operate our business, we may be held liable or incur fines or penalties in connection with such requirements. As the nature of our business involves the use or handling of certain potentially hazardous or toxic substances, including spray foam applications and lead-based paint, we may be held liable for claims alleging injury or damage resulting from the release of or exposure to such substances. In addition, as owners and lessees of real property, we may be held liable for, among other things, hazardous or toxic substances, including asbestos or petroleum products on, at, under or emanating from currently or formerly owned or operated properties, or any off-site disposal locations, or for any known or newly discovered environmental conditions at or relating to any of our properties, including those arising from activities conducted by previous occupants or at adjoining properties, without regard to whether we knew of or were responsible for such release. We may be required to investigate, remove, remediate or monitor the presence or release of such hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products. We may also be held liable to a governmental entity for fines and penalties or to third parties for damages, including for bodily injury, property damage and natural resource damage in connection with the presence or release of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products. In addition, expenditures may be required in the future as a result of releases of, or exposure to, hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products, the discovery of currently unknown environmental conditions or changes in environmental laws and regulations or their interpretation or enforcement and in certain instances, such expenditures may be material.\nIncreases in union organizing activity and work stoppages could delay or reduce availability of products that we install and increase our costs.\nLess than one percent of our employees are currently covered by collective bargaining or other similar labor agreements. However, if a larger number of our employees were to unionize, including in the wake of any future legislation that makes it easier for employees to unionize, our business could be negatively affected. Any inability by us to negotiate collective bargaining arrangements could cause strikes or other work stoppages, and new contracts could result in increased operating costs. If any such strikes or other work stoppages occur, or if other employees become represented by a union, we could experience a disruption of our operations and higher labor costs.\nIn addition, certain of our suppliers have unionized work forces and certain of our products are transported by unionized truckers. Strikes, work stoppages or slowdowns could result in slowdowns or closures of facilities where the products that we install are manufactured or could affect the ability of our suppliers to deliver such products to us. Any interruption in the production or delivery of these products could delay or reduce availability of these products and increase our costs.\nIncreases in fuel costs could adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe price of oil has fluctuated over the last few years, creating volatility in our fuel costs. We do not currently hedge our fuel costs. Increases in fuel costs can negatively impact our cost to deliver our products to our customers and thus increase our cost of sales. If we are unable to increase the selling price of our products to our customers to cover any increases in fuel costs, net income may be adversely affected.\nWe may be adversely affected by disruptions in our information technology systems.\nOur operations are dependent upon our information technology systems, including our web-enabled internal software technology, jobCORE. The jobCORE software provides in-depth operational and financial performance data from individual branch locations to the corporate office. We rely upon such information technology systems to manage customer orders on a timely basis, to coordinate our sales and installation activities across locations and to manage invoicing. A substantial disruption in our information technology systems for any prolonged time period (arising from, for example, system capacity limits from unexpected increases in our volume of business, outages, computer viruses, unauthorized access or delays in our service) could result in delays in receiving inventory and supplies or installing our products on a timely basis for our customers, which could adversely affect our reputation and customer relationships. Our systems might be damaged or interrupted by natural or man-made events or by computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, or similar disruptions affecting the Internet and our disaster recovery plan may be ineffective at mitigating the effects of these risks. Such delays, problems or costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nBecause we operate our business through highly dispersed locations across the United States, our operations may be materially adversely affected by inconsistent practices and the operating results of individual branches may vary.\nWe operate our business through a network of highly dispersed locations throughout the United States, supported by corporate executives and services in our headquarters, with local branch management retaining responsibility for day-to-day operations and adherence to applicable local laws. Our operating structure can make it difficult for us to coordinate procedures across our operations in a timely manner or at all. In addition, our branches may require significant oversight and coordination from headquarters to support their growth. Inconsistent implementation of corporate strategy and policies at the local level could materially and adversely affect our overall profitability, business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nIn addition, the operating results of an individual branch may differ from that of another branch for a variety of reasons, including market size, management practices, competitive landscape, regulatory requirements and local economic conditions. As a result, certain of our branches may experience higher or lower levels of growth than other branches. Growth of the company is occurring at different rates across our branches and, accordingly, could have a disproportionate effect on the future growth of the company as a whole. Therefore, our overall financial performance and results of operations may not be indicative of the performance and results of operations of any individual branch.\nRestrictions in our credit agreement, or any other indebtedness we may incur in the future, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, ability to make distributions to stockholders and the value of our common stock.\nOur credit agreement, or any future credit facility or other indebtedness we enter into, may limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur or guarantee additional debt;\n\u2022\nmake distributions or dividends on or redeem or repurchase shares of common stock;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments and acquisitions;\n\u2022\nmake capital expenditures;\n\u2022\nincur certain liens or permit them to exist;\n\u2022\nenter into certain types of transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nacquire, merge or consolidate with another company; and\n\u2022\ntransfer, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets.\nOur credit agreement contains, and any future credit facility or other debt instruments we may enter into will also likely contain, covenants requiring us to maintain certain financial ratios and meet certain tests, such as a fixed charge coverage ratio and a leverage ratio. See Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Liquidity and Capital Resources, Revolving Credit Facility. Our ability to comply with those financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control, and we may not be able to comply with those ratios and tests when required to do so under the applicable debt instruments.\nThe provisions of our credit agreement or other debt instruments may affect our ability to obtain future financing and pursue attractive business opportunities and our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in business conditions. In addition, a failure to comply with the provisions of our credit agreement, any future credit facility or other debt instruments could result in a default or an event of default that could enable our lenders or other debt holders to declare the outstanding principal of that debt, together with accrued and unpaid interest, to be immediately due and payable. If the payment of our debt is accelerated, our assets may be insufficient to repay such debt in full, and our stockholders could experience a partial or total loss of their investment.\nWe could manage working capital in ways that may affect our cash flow from operations.\nSince we aim to continuously manage our working capital, we could manage our payments to suppliers differently in the future. Changes in how we manage our payments to suppliers could change our cash flow from operations and change our working capital as a percentage of sales. In addition, we have two supply contracts with minimum purchase requirements based on quantity rather than a specific market rate. These obligations may cause us to purchase materials earlier than we otherwise would and increase our working capital requirements. There is no guarantee that our working capital as a percentage of sales will not continue to increase in the future.\nRISKS RELATED TO OWNERSHIP OF OUR COMMON STOCK\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially, and your investment may decline in value.\nThe market price of our common stock may be significantly affected by factors, such as:\n\u2022\nmarket conditions affecting the residential construction and building products industries;\n\u2022\nquarterly variations in our results of operations;\n\u2022\nchanges in government regulations;\n\u2022\nthe announcement of acquisitions by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in general economic and political conditions;\n\u2022\nvolatility in the financial markets;\n\u2022\nresults of our operations and the operations of others in our industry;\n\u2022\nchanges in interest rates;\n\u2022\nthreatened or actual litigation and government investigations;\n\u2022\nthe addition or departure of key personnel;\n\u2022\nactions taken by our stockholders, including the sale or disposition of their shares of our common stock;\n\u2022\ndifferences between our actual financial and operating results and those expected by investors and analysts and changes in analysts\u2019 recommendations or projections.\nThese and other factors may lower the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nFurthermore, in recent years the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant impact on the market price of securities issued by many companies, including companies in our industry. The changes frequently appear to occur without regard to the operating performance of the affected companies. Hence, the price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with us, and these fluctuations could materially reduce the price of our common stock and materially affect the value of your investment.\nThe obligations associated with being a public company require significant resources and management attention.\nWe completed our initial public offering in February 2014. As a public company, we face increased legal, accounting, administrative and other costs and expenses that we did not incur as a private company, particularly after we are no longer an emerging growth company. We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, which requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition and proxy and other information statements, and the rules and regulations implemented by the SEC, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and the NYSE each of which imposes additional reporting and other obligations on public companies. As a public company, we are required to:\n\u2022\nprepare and distribute periodic reports, proxy statements and other stockholder communications in compliance with the federal securities laws and the NYSE rules;\n\u2022\nexpand the roles and duties of our board of directors and committees thereof;\n\u2022\nmaintain an internal audit function;\n\u2022\ninstitute more comprehensive financial reporting and disclosure compliance functions;\n\u2022\ninvolve and retain to a greater degree outside counsel and accountants in the activities listed above;\n\u2022\nenhance our investor relations function;\n\u2022\nestablish new internal policies, including those relating to trading in our securities and disclosure controls and procedures;\n\u2022\nretain additional personnel;\n\u2022\ncomply with NYSE listing standards; and\n\u2022\ncomply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\nWe expect these rules and regulations and changes in laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, which have created uncertainty for public companies, to increase legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time consuming and costly. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. Our investment in compliance with existing and evolving regulatory requirements will result in increased administrative expenses and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThese increased costs may lessen our ability to expand our business and achieve our strategic objectives. We also expect that it will be expensive to maintain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers. Furthermore, if we are unable to satisfy our obligations as a public company, we could be subject to delisting of our common stock, fines, sanctions and other regulatory action and civil litigation.\nIf we are unable to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future, the accuracy and timeliness of our financial reporting may be adversely affected.\nAlthough we were not required to and did not engage our independent registered public accounting firm to conduct an audit of our internal control over financial reporting, in connection with the audits of our consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, our independent registered public accounting firm informed us that they identified a material weakness relating to our internal control over financial reporting under standards established by the PCAOB. The PCAOB defines a material weakness as a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company\u2019s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nWe developed a plan and implemented a number of actions to remediate this material weakness. After implementing new internal controls and procedures, we concluded that we have remediated the previously identified material weakness as of December 31, 2014. Additional information about our remediation efforts and internal control over financial reporting are described in Item 9A. Controls and Procedures in this Form 10-K.\nAlthough we believe we have addressed the previously identified material weakness, the measures we have taken may not be effective, and we may not be able to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future. In addition, other material weaknesses or deficiencies may be identified in the future. Once we cease to be an emerging growth company and once we become an accelerated filer or a large accelerated filer, as of each fiscal year end thereafter, our independent registered public accounting firm will be required to evaluate and report on our internal controls over financial reporting. If we are unable to correct material weaknesses or deficiencies in internal controls in a timely manner, our ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information accurately and within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, may be adversely affected. This failure could negatively affect the market price and trading liquidity of our common stock, cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, subject us to civil and criminal investigations and penalties, and generally materially and adversely impact our business and financial condition.\nWe are an emerging growth company and, as a result of the reduced disclosure and governance requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, our common stock may be less attractive to investors.\nWe are an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act, and we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies. Those exemptions include, but are not limited to, an exemption from the auditor attestation requirement of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure about executive compensation arrangements pursuant to the rules applicable to smaller reporting companies and no requirement to seek non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements. We have elected to adopt these reduced disclosure requirements. We may take advantage of these provisions until we are no longer an emerging growth company. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the first sale of our common stock pursuant to an effective registration statement, or February 12, 2019; (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.0 billion or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive as a result of our taking advantage of these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result of our choices, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nFuture sales of our common stock, or the perception in the public markets that these sales may occur, may depress our stock price.\nThe market price of our common stock could decline significantly as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock. These sales, or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock or make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate.\nWe have 31,539,087 shares of common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2014. The shares of common stock are freely tradable, except for any shares of common stock that may be held or acquired by our directors, executive officers and other affiliates, the sale of which will be restricted under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act. As of December 31, 2014, 2,976,510 of the 3,000,000 shares of common stock authorized for issuance under the 2014 Omnibus Incentive Plan were available for issuance. These shares will become eligible for sale in the public market in the future, subject to certain legal and contractual limitations.\nMoreover, pursuant to a registration rights agreement among us and certain of our current stockholders, certain of our stockholders have the right to require us to register under the Securities Act. See \u201cCertain Relationships and Related-Party Transactions-Registration Rights Agreement.\u201d If our existing stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or if the public perceives that such sales could occur, this could have an adverse impact on the market price of our common stock, even if there is no relationship between such sales and the performance of our business.\nAlso, in the future, we may issue shares of our common stock in connection with investments or acquisitions. The amount of shares of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our then-outstanding shares of our common stock.\nJeff Edwards has significant ownership of our common stock and may have interests that conflict with those of our other stockholders.\nAs of December 31, 2014, Jeff Edwards beneficially owns approximately 27.4% of our common stock. So long as Jeff Edwards continues to hold, directly or indirectly, shares of common stock representing a significant\npercentage of the voting power of our common stock, he will be able to exercise control over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, amendment of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and approval of significant corporate transactions, and will have significant influence over our management and policies. This concentration of voting power may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us or discouraging others from making tender offers for our shares of common stock, which could prevent stockholders from receiving a premium for their shares of common stock. These actions may be taken even if other stockholders oppose them. The interests of Jeff Edwards may not always coincide with the interests of other stockholders, and he may act in a manner that advances his best interests and not necessarily those of our other stockholders. In addition, under our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, Jeff Edwards is permitted to pursue corporate opportunities for himself, rather than for us.\nCertain of our stockholders that are controlled by Jeff Edwards have pledged shares of our common stock as collateral for loans, which may cause Jeff Edwards\u2019 interests to conflict with the interests of our other stockholders and may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nCertain of our stockholders, PJAM IBP Holdings, LLC, and Installed Building Systems, Inc., which are controlled by Jeff Edwards, or the Edwards Stockholders, have pledged shares of our common stock as collateral for loans. In 2014 and 2015 through the date of this filing, the Edwards Stockholders pledged 6,655,500 shares and 875,000 shares, respectively, of our common stock as collateral for loans. We are not a party to these loans, which are full recourse against the Edwards Stockholders and are secured, in part, by pledges of a portion of our common stock currently beneficially owned by Jeff Edwards and the Edwards Stockholders. The terms of these loans were negotiated directly between Jeff Edwards and members of his family and the respective lending institutions.\nThese pledges of shares of our common stock may cause Jeff Edwards\u2019 interests to not always coincide with the interests of other stockholders, and he may act in a manner that advances his best interests and not necessarily those of our other stockholders. The occurrence of certain events under these loan agreements could result in the future sales of such shares and significantly reduce Jeff Edwards\u2019 ownership in us. Such sales could adversely affect the market and trading price of our common stock. In addition, if the value of our common stock declines, the lending institutions may require additional collateral for the loans, which could cause the Edwards Stockholders to pledge additional shares of our common stock. We can give no assurances that the Edwards Stockholders will not pledge additional shares of our common stock in the future, whether as a result of lender calls requiring additional collateral or their entry into new loans that require them to pledge shares of our common stock.\nIn addition, our directors, executive officers and other stockholders may pledge shares of our common stock in the future. Depending on the occurrence of certain events relating to the obligations for which these pledges may serve as collateral, our directors, executive officers or other stockholders may experience a foreclosure or margin call that could result in the sale of such pledged shares of our common stock, in the open market or otherwise. Such sales could adversely affect the market and trading price of our common stock\nCapped call transactions that were entered into by parties affiliated with Jeff Edwards may affect the value of our common stock.\nIn June 2014, IBP Holding Company and Installed Building Systems, Inc., both entities that are controlled by Jeff Edwards, entered into capped call option transactions with respect to approximately 1.1 million shares of our common stock with an affiliate of one of the underwriters of our initial public offering and June 2014 secondary public offering, or the option counterparty. The transactions are expected to result in future cash payments to the parties to the extent the price of our common stock upon expiration of the options is greater than the strike price of the options, subject to a cap.\nIn connection with establishing its initial hedge of any capped call transactions, the option counterparty (or one of its affiliates) purchased shares of our common stock.\nIn addition, the option counterparty (or one of its affiliates) may modify its hedge position by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions from time to time. This activity could also cause or mitigate an increase or decrease in the market price of our common stock. We cannot predict what effect the capped call transactions could have on the price of our common stock.\nProvisions of our charter documents and Delaware law could delay, discourage or prevent an acquisition of us, even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders, and could make it more difficult for our stockholders to change our management.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares of our common stock. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempt by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult to replace or remove members of our board of directors. These provisions include the following:\n\u2022\na classified board of directors with three-year staggered terms;\n\u2022\nno cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u2022\nthe exclusive right of our board of directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors to authorize the issuance of shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of the holders of our stock or a hostile acquirer;\n\u2022\na prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\na requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by the chairman of our board of directors, our Chief Executive Officer or upon a resolution approved by a majority of the total number of directors that we would have if there were no vacancies, and not by our stockholders; and\n\u2022\nadvance notice procedures that stockholders must comply with in order to nominate candidates to our board of directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\nIn addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with a stockholder owning 15% or more of such corporation\u2019s outstanding voting stock for a period of three years following the date on which such stockholder became an \u201cinterested\u201d stockholder. This provision could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control, whether or not it is desired by or beneficial to our stockholders. Any delay or prevention of a change of control transaction or changes in our board of directors and management could deter potential acquirers or prevent the completion of a transaction in which our stockholders could receive a substantial premium over the then-current market price for their shares of our common stock.\nWe do not expect to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe intend to retain our future earnings, if any, in order to reinvest in the development and growth of our business and, therefore, do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. Any future determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, the limits imposed by the terms of our credit agreement, or any then-existing debt instruments, and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant. Accordingly, investors in our common stock may need to sell their shares to realize a return on their investment in our common stock, and investors may not be able to sell their shares at or above the prices paid for them.\nIf securities analysts do not publish favorable reports about us or if we, or our industry, are the subject of unfavorable commentary, the price of our common stock could decline.\nThe trading price for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports about us that are published by analysts in the financial industry. Analysts could issue negative commentary about us or our industry, or they could downgrade our common stock. We may also not receive sufficient research coverage or visibility in the market. Any of these factors could result in the decline of the trading price of our common stock, causing investors in our common stock to lose all or a portion of their investment.", "PERMNO": 14479, "SIC": 1700, "TIC": "IBP"}
