Risk Factors.\nIn analyzing whether to make or to continue an investment in our securities, investors should consider, among other factors, the following risk factors.\nWe are subject to credit risk in connection with our lending activities, and our financial condition and results of operations may be negatively impacted by economic conditions and other factors that adversely affect our borrowers.\nOur financial condition and results of operations are affected by the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans, and in a timely manner. The risks of non-payment and late payments are assessed through our underwriting and loan review procedures based on several factors including credit risks of a particular borrower, changes in economic conditions, the duration of the loan and in the case of a collateralized loan, uncertainties as to the future value of the collateral and other factors. Despite our efforts, we do and will experience loan losses, and our financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected. Unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by declines in economic growth, business activity or investor or business confidence; limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital; increases in inflation or interest rates; high unemployment, natural disasters, terrorist acts, or a combination of these or other factors.\nOur results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by changing economic conditions.\nWhile the economy and real estate market conditions have significantly improved in recent years, a return to a recessionary period could adversely affect our customers in a manner that would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Volatility in the housing markets, real estate values and unemployment levels, and the deterioration of economic conditions in our market area, could affect our customers\u2019 ability to repay loans and adversely affect our results of operations and future growth potential in the following ways:\n\u2022\nLoan delinquencies may increase;\n\u2022\nProblem assets and foreclosures may increase;\n\u2022\nDemand for our products and services may decline;\n\u2022\nThe carrying value of our other real estate owned may decline further; and\n\u2022\nCollateral for loans made by us, especially real estate, may continue to decline in value, in turn reducing a customer\u2019s borrowing power, and reducing the value of assets and collateral associated with our loans.\nChanges in interest rates could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation.\nOur net income depends primarily upon our net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on loans, investments and other interest-earning assets and the interest expense incurred on deposits and borrowed funds. The level of net interest income is primarily a function of the average balance of our interest-earning assets, the average balance of our interest-bearing liabilities, and the spread between the yield on such assets and the cost of such liabilities. These factors are influenced by both the pricing and mix of our interest-earning assets and our interest-bearing liabilities which, in turn, are impacted by such external factors as the local\neconomy, competition for loans and deposits, the monetary policy of the Federal Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors (the \u201cFOMC\u201d), and market interest rates.\nDifferent types of assets and liabilities may react differently, and at different times, to changes in market interest rates. We expect that we will periodically experience gaps in the interest rate sensitivities of our assets and liabilities. That means either our interest-bearing liabilities will be more sensitive to changes in market interest rates than our interest-earning assets, or vice versa. When interest-bearing liabilities mature or re-price more quickly than interest-earning assets, an increase in market rates of interest could reduce our net interest income. Likewise, when interest-earning assets mature or re-price more quickly than interest-bearing liabilities, falling interest rates could reduce our net interest income. We are unable to predict changes in market interest rates, which are affected by many factors beyond our control, including inflation, deflation, recession, unemployment, money supply, domestic and international events and changes in the United States and other financial markets.\nWe also attempt to manage risk from changes in market interest rates, in part, by controlling the mix of interest rate sensitive assets and interest rate sensitive liabilities. However, interest rate risk management techniques are not exact. A rapid increase or decrease in interest rates could adversely affect our results of operations and financial performance.\nOur high concentration of commercial real estate loans exposes us to increased lending risk.\nAs of September 30, 2019, the primary composition of our total loan portfolio was as follows:\n\u2022\ncommercial real estate loans of $543.5 million, or 53.4 percent of total loans;\n\u2022\nresidential real estate loans of $220.0 million, or 21.6 percent of total loans;\n\u2022\ncommercial and industrial loans of $99.7 million, or 9.8 percent of total loans;\n\u2022\nconstruction and development loans of $43.8 million, or 4.3 percent of total loans and\n\u2022\nconsumer loans of $35.3 million, or 3.6 percent of total loans.\nCommercial real estate loans, which comprised 53.4 percent of our total loan portfolio as of September 30, 2019, expose us to a greater risk of loss than do residential mortgage loans. Commercial real estate loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to residential loans. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one commercial loan or one credit relationship exposes us to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to one residential mortgage loan. Any significant failure to pay on time by our customers or a significant default by our customers would materially and adversely affect us.\nAlthough the economy in our market area generally, and the real estate market in particular, have been relatively strong, we can give you no assurance that it will continue to grow or that the rate of growth will accelerate to historic levels. Many factors could reduce or halt growth in our local economy and real estate market. Accordingly, it may become more difficult for commercial real estate borrowers to repay their loans in a timely manner than in the current economic climate, as commercial real estate borrowers\u2019 ability to repay their loans frequently depends on the successful development of their properties. The deterioration of one or a few of our commercial real estate loans could cause a material increase in our level of nonperforming loans, which would result in a loss of revenue from these loans and could result in an increase in the provision for loan and lease losses and/or an increase in charge-offs, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our net income. We also may incur losses on commercial real estate loans due to declines in occupancy rates and rental rates, which may decrease property values and may reduce the likelihood that a borrower may find permanent financing alternatives. Weaknesses in the commercial real estate market in general could negatively impact our collateral. Any weakening of the commercial real estate market may increase the likelihood of default of these loans, which could negatively impact our loan portfolio\u2019s performance and asset quality. If we are required to liquidate the collateral securing a loan to satisfy the debt during a period of reduced real estate values, we could incur material losses. Any of these events could increase our costs, require management time and attention, and materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe concentration of our commercial real estate loan portfolio subjects us heightened regulatory scrutiny.\nThe FDIC, the Federal Reserve and the OCC have promulgated joint guidance on sound risk management practices for financial institutions with concentrations in commercial real estate lending. Under the joint guidance, a financial institution that, like us, is actively involved in commercial real estate lending should perform a risk assessment to identify concentrations. A financial institution may have a concentration in commercial real estate lending if, among other factors: (i) total reported loans for construction, land development, and other land represent 100 percent or more of total risk-based capital or (ii) total reported loans for construction, land development and other land and loans secured by multifamily and non-owner occupied non-farm residential properties (excluding loans secured by owner-occupied properties) represent 300 percent or more of total risk-based capital and the institution\u2019s commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased by 50 percent or more during the prior 36 month period. In such event, management should employ heightened risk management practices, including board and management oversight and strategic planning, development of underwriting standards, risk assessment and monitoring through market analysis and stress testing.\nThe Bank\u2019s total reported loans for construction, land development and other land represented 24.7 percent of capital at September 30, 2019 as compared to 32.5 percent of capital at September 30, 2018. This ratio is below the regulatory commercial real estate concentration guideline level of 100 percent for land and construction loans. The Bank\u2019s total reported commercial real estate loans to total capital was 306.5 percent at September 30, 2019, as compared to 343.5 percent of capital at September 30, 2018. This ratio is above the regulatory commercial real estate concentration guideline level of 300 percent for all investor real estate loans. The Bank\u2019s commercial real estate portfolio has increased by 134.8 percent over the preceding 36 months.\nIf our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings will decrease.\nLike all financial institutions, we maintain an allowance for loan losses to provide for loan defaults and nonperformance. In determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses, we review our loans and our loss and delinquency experience and we evaluate economic conditions. If our assumptions are incorrect, our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio.\nIn addition, bank regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs. Any increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs as required by regulatory authorities might have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nA new accounting standard will likely require us to increase our allowance for loan losses and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) has adopted a new accounting standard that will be effective for the Company and the Bank for fiscal years beginning on October 1, 2023. This standard, referred to as Current Expected Credit Loss, or (\u201cCECL\u201d), will require financial institutions to determine periodic estimates of lifetime expected credit losses on loans, and recognize the expected credit losses as allowances for loan losses. This will change the current method of providing allowances for loan losses that are probable, which would likely require us to increase our allowance for loan losses, and to greatly increase the types of data we would need to collect and review to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses. Any increase in our allowance for loan losses or expenses incurred to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires us to evaluate periodically the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and to include a management report assessing the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Section 404 also requires our independent registered public accounting firm to report on our internal controls over financial reporting. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, we cannot assure you that we will be able to conclude in the future that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting. If we fail to maintain effective internal controls, we might be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC or NASDAQ. Any such action could\nadversely affect our financial results and the market price of our common stock and may also result in delayed filings with the SEC.\nStrong competition within our market area could hurt our profits and slow growth.\nThe banking and financial services industry in our market area is highly competitive. We may not be able to compete effectively in our markets, which could adversely affect our results of operations. The increasingly competitive environment is a result of changes in regulation, advances in technology and product delivery systems, and consolidation among financial service providers. Larger institutions have greater resources and access to capital markets, with higher lending limits, more advanced technology and broader suites of services. Competition at times requires increases in deposit rates and decreases in loan rates, and adversely impact our net interest margin.\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and we may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the FRB, our primary federal regulator, the OCC, the Bank\u2019s primary federal regulator, and by the FDIC, as insurer of the Bank\u2019s deposits. Such regulation and supervision govern the activities in which an institution and its holding company may engage and are intended primarily for the protection of the insurance fund and the depositors and borrowers of the Bank rather than for holders of our common stock. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on our operations, the classification of our assets and determination of the level of our allowance for loan losses. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, legislation or supervisory action, may have a material impact on our operations.\nThe fair value of our investment securities can fluctuate due to market conditions outside of our control.\nAs of September 30, 2019, the fair value of our investment securities portfolio was approximately $41.0 million. We have historically adopted a conservative investment strategy, with concentrations of securities that are backed by government sponsored enterprises. Factors beyond our control can significantly influence the fair value of securities in our portfolio and can cause potential adverse changes to the fair value of these securities. These factors include, but are not limited to, rating agency actions in respect of the securities, defaults by the issuer or with respect to the underlying securities, and changes in market interest rates and continued instability in the capital markets. Any of these factors, among others, could cause other-than-temporary impairments and realized and/or unrealized losses in future periods and declines in other comprehensive income, which could have a material adverse effect on us. The process for determining whether impairment of a security is other-than-temporary usually requires complex, subjective judgments about the future financial performance and liquidity of the issuer and any collateral underlying the security in order to assess the probability of receiving all contractual principal and interest payments on the security.\nOur growth-oriented business strategy could be adversely affected if we are not able to attract and retain skilled employees or if we lose the services of our senior management team.\nOur ability to manage growth will depend upon our ability to continue to attract, hire and retain skilled employees. The unanticipated loss of members of our senior management team, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and ability to execute our strategic goals. Our success will also depend on the ability of our officers and key employees to continue to implement and improve our operational and other systems, to manage multiple, concurrent customer relationships and to hire, train and manage our employees.\nReforms to and uncertainty regarding London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) may adversely affect the business.\nIn 2017, a committee of private-market derivative participants and their regulators convened by the Federal Reserve, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (\u201cARRC\u201d), was created to identify an alternative reference interest rate to replace LIBOR. The ARRC announced Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d), a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by Treasury securities, as its preferred alternative to LIBOR. The Chief Executive of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced its intention to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR to the administrator of LIBOR after 2021. Subsequently, the Federal Reserve Bank announced final plans for the\nproduction of SOFR, which resulted in the commencement of its published rates by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on April 2, 2018. Whether or not SOFR attains market traction as a LIBOR replacement tool remains in question and the future of LIBOR at this time is uncertain. The uncertainty as to the nature and effect of such reforms and actions and the political discontinuance of LIBOR may adversely affect the value of and return on the Company\u2019s financial assets and liabilities that are based on or are linked to LIBOR, the Company\u2019s results of operations or financial condition. In addition, these reforms may also require extensive changes to the contracts that govern these LIBOR based products, as well as the Company\u2019s systems and processes.\nWe are dependent on our information technology and telecommunications systems and third-party servicers, and cyber-attacks, systems failures, interruptions or breaches of security could have a material adverse effect on us.\nInformation technology systems are critical to our business. We use various technology systems to manage our customer relationships, general ledger, securities, deposits, and loans. We have established policies and procedures to prevent or limit the impact of system failures, interruptions, and security breaches (including privacy breaches), but such events may still occur and may not be adequately addressed if they do occur. In addition any compromise of our systems could deter customers from using our products and services. Although we rely on security systems to provide security and authentication necessary to effect the secure transmission of data, these precautions may not protect our systems from compromises or breaches of security.\nIn addition, we outsource a majority of our data processing to certain third-party providers. If these third-party providers encounter difficulties, or if we have difficulty communicating with them, our ability to adequately process and account for transactions could be affected, and our business operations could be adversely affected. Threats to information security also exist in the processing of customer information through various other vendors and their personnel.\nThe occurrence of any system failures, interruption, or breach of security could damage our reputation and result in a loss of customers and business thereby subjecting us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or could expose us to litigation and possible financial liability. Furthermore, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures arising from operational and security risks. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRecent New Jersey legislative changes may increase our tax expense.\nIn connection with adopting the 2019 fiscal year budget, the New Jersey legislature adopted, and the Governor signed, legislation that imposes a temporary surtax on corporations earning New Jersey allocated income in excess of $1 million of 2.5 percent for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2019, and of 1.5 percent for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2021. The legislation also requires combined filing for members of an affiliated group for tax privilege periods ending on or after July 31, 2019, changing New Jersey\u2019s current status as a separate return state, and limits the deductibility of dividends received. These changes are not temporary. Regulations implementing the legislative changes have not yet been issued, and the Company cannot yet fully evaluate the impact of the legislation on overall tax expense or the valuation of the deferred tax asset. It is likely that the Company will lose benefits of various tax management strategies and, as a result, the total tax expense will increase.\nOur ability to pay cash dividends is limited, and we may be unable to pay dividends even if we desire to do so.\nWe are a legal entity separate and distinct from our banking and other subsidiaries. Our principal source of cash flow, including cash flow to pay dividends to our shareholders if we desire to do so in the future, and to pay the principal of and interest on our outstanding debt, is dividends from the Bank. There are various regulations that limit the Bank\u2019s ability to pay dividends to us, and our ability to pay dividends to shareholders. In particular, the prior approval of the FRB and OCC may be required in certain circumstances prior to the payment of dividends by us or the Bank. There can be no assurances that we would receive such approval, if it were required.\nIn addition, the OCC has the authority to prohibit a national bank from paying dividends if such payment is deemed to be an unsafe or unsound practice. The FRB and the FDIC also have the authority to prohibit or to limit the payment of dividends by a banking organization under its jurisdiction if, in the regulator\u2019s opinion, the organization is engaged in or is about to engage in an unsafe or unsound practice. Depending on the financial\ncondition of the Bank, we may be deemed to be engaged in an unsafe or unsound practice if the Bank were to pay dividends.\nPayment of dividends could also be subject to regulatory limitations if the Bank became \u201cunder-capitalized\u201d for purposes of the \u201cprompt corrective action\u201d regulations of the federal bank regulatory agencies.\nNo assurances can be given that the Bank will, in any particular circumstances, pay dividends to us. If the Bank fails to make dividend payments to us, and sufficient cash or liquidity is not otherwise available, we may not be able to make principal and interest payments on our outstanding debt, or dividend payments on our common stock even if we desire to pay cash dividends in the future.", "PERMNO": 92685, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "MLVF"}
