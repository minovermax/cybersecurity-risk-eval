RISK FACTORS\nOur operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those described below. If any of these risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In that case, the value of our common stock could decline substantially.\nSecurity breaches, disruptions or unauthorized access to sensitive information and/or personal information that we store, process, use or transmit in our business may harm our reputation and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nA significant challenge to electronic commerce is the secure transmission of sensitive and/or personal information over information technology networks and systems which process, transmit and store electronic information, and manage or support a variety of business processes. The collection, maintenance, use, disclosure, and disposal of sensitive and personal information by our businesses are regulated at state and federal levels. Furthermore, we are required to comply with the Payment Card Industry\u2019s Data Security Standards (\u201cPCI DSS\u201d) and the rules and standards promulgated by the National Automated Clearing House Association (\u201cNACHA\u201d) because we provide online payment and electronic check processing services. Because we provide the electronic transmission of sensitive and personal information released from and filed with various government entities and we perform online payment and electronic check processing services, we face the risk of a security breach, whether through computer hacking, acts of vandalism or theft, malware, computer viruses, human errors, catastrophes or other unforeseen events that could lead to significant disruptions or compromises of our information technology networks and systems or the unauthorized release or use of sensitive or personal information. Additionally, vulnerabilities in the security of our own internal systems could compromise the confidentiality of, or result in unauthorized access to, personal information of our employees.\nWe rely on encryption and authentication technology purchased or licensed from third parties to provide the security and authentication tools to effectively secure transmission of confidential information, including user credit card information and banking data. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography, threats that evolve ahead of tools designed to counter them, or other developments may result in the breach or compromise of technology used by us to protect transaction data. Data breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues, such as so-called \u201csocial engineering.\u201d\nDespite the various security measures we have in place to protect sensitive and personal information from unauthorized disclosure and to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, our information technology networks and systems and those of our third party vendors and service providers can never be made completely secure against security incidents. Even the most well protected information, networks, systems, and facilities remain vulnerable to security breaches or disruptions, because (i) the techniques used in such attempts are constantly evolving and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases are designed not to be detected and, in fact, may not be detected for an extended period and (ii) the security methodologies, protocols, systems and procedures used for protection are implemented by humans at each level, and human errors may occur. Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, or if such measures are implemented, and even if appropriate training is conducted in support of such measures, human errors may still occur. It is impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk. A party, whether internal or external, who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate information, including, but not limited to user credit card information or other sensitive and personal information, or cause interruptions or direct damage to our government portals or their users.\nUnder payment card rules and our contracts with our credit card processors, if there is a breach of payment card information that we store, process, or transmit, we could be liable to the payment card issuers for their cost of issuing new cards and related expenses, and to partners for costs of notification and remediation, and for any damages to users under state laws or our partner contracts. If we fail to follow PCI DSS, we could incur significant fines imposed by the Payment Card Industry or jeopardize our ability to give customers the option of using payment cards to fund their payments or pay their fees, even if there is no compromise of personal information. In addition, if we fail to follow NACHA security requirements, we may be liable for substantial fines and penalties, cease and desist orders, and other sanctions that could restrict or eliminate our ability to provide certain of our services in one or more states or accept certain types of transactions in one or more states, or could force us to make costly changes to our business practices. If we were unable to accept payment cards or process checks electronically, our business would be negatively impacted.\nIn addition, any noncompliance with privacy laws or a security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized access, use or disclosure of sensitive or personal information, or other significant disruption involving our information technology networks and systems (whether or not caused by a breach of our contractual obligations or our negligence), may lead to negative publicity, impair our ability to conduct our business, subject us to private litigation and government investigations and enforcement actions and cause us to incur potentially significant liability, damages or remediation costs. It may also cause the governments with whom we contract to lose confidence in us, any of which may cause the termination or modification of our government contracts and impair our ability to win future contracts. Actual or anticipated attacks and risks affecting our own or our government partners\u2019 environment may cause us to incur increasing costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, to train employees, and to engage third party security experts and consultants. Although we maintain insurance coverage that, subject to policy terms and conditions and subject to a retention, is designed to address certain aspects of security and privacy liability, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover or protect against the costs, liabilities, and other adverse effects arising from a security breach or system disruption. If we fail to reasonably maintain the security of confidential information, we may also suffer significant reputational and financial losses and our results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, and liquidity may be adversely affected.\nBecause we have outsourced portal and software development and service contracts with a limited number of governments, the termination or non-renewal of certain of these contracts may harm our business.\nCurrently, we have 28 portals through which we provide enterprise-wide outsourced portal services to state governments. These contracts typically have multi-year terms with provisions for renewals for various periods at the option of the government. In addition, we have a limited number of other contracts with government agencies through which we provide outsourced portal and software development and services.\nA government typically has the option to terminate its contract prior to the expiration date if we breach a material contractual obligation and fail to cure such breach within a specified period or upon the occurrence of other events or circumstances specified in our contracts.\nIn addition, we currently have 18 contracts under which we provide outsourced portal services or software development and services that can be terminated by the other party without cause on a specified period of notice. Collectively, revenues generated from these contracts represented 62% of our total consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014. The Texas portal, which is one of the 18 contracts noted above, accounted for approximately 22% of our total consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014. In the event that any of these contracts is terminated without cause, the terms of the respective contract may require the government to pay a fee to us in order to continue to use our software in its portal. Also, the contract with the FMCSA can be terminated by the other party without cause on a specified period of notice.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we have 11 contracts under which we provide outsourced portal services or software development and services that have expiration dates within the 12-month period following December 31, 2014. Collectively, revenues generated from these contracts represented 25% of our total consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014. If a contract is not renewed after a defined term, the government partner would be entitled to take over the portal in place with no future obligation to us, except as otherwise provided in the contract and except for the services we provide on a software-as-a-service, or SaaS, basis, which would be available to the government agency on a fee-for-service basis.\nThe loss of a contract with one or more states or the FMCSA, as a result of the expiration, termination, or failure to renew the contract, if not replaced, could significantly reduce our revenues and profitability. If these revenue shortfalls were to occur, our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition would be harmed. We cannot be certain if, when, or to what extent, governments might fail to renew or terminate any or all of their contracts with us.\nBecause we generally grant our government partners fully paid, perpetual licenses to use and modify certain software and applications we develop, upon a termination by them for cause or the natural expiration of our portal contracts, our government partners could elect to take over the operation and maintenance of our software and applications themselves, or hire a competitor to operate and maintain such software and applications. Any such decision to do so could adversely affect our revenues and profits.\nAfter termination for cause or the natural expiration of our portal contracts, it is possible that governments and their contractors may operate the portals themselves using the perpetual use license we typically are contractually obligated to provide to them. This license generally permits the government to use and modify the software programs and other applications we have developed for them in the operation of their portals (excluding software applications that we provide on a SaaS basis) on a perpetual, royalty-free basis. This perpetual use license could make it easier and more cost effective for our customers to elect not to enter into a new contract with us after the expiration of one of our portal contracts. Any such election could adversely affect our revenues and profits. Additionally, anyone using our software programs and other applications may inadvertently allow our intellectual property or other information to fall into the hands of third parties, including our competitors. In the event that a contract is terminated prior to the natural expiration of the term without cause, the terms of the respective contract typically require the government to pay a fee to us in order to continue to use our software in its portal.\nThe growth in our revenues may be limited by the number of governments and government agencies that choose to provide eGovernment services using our business model and by the finite number of governments with which we may contract for our eGovernment services.\nOur revenues are generated principally from contracts with state governments and government agencies within a state to provide eGovernment services on behalf of those government entities to complete transactions and distribute public information electronically. The growth in our revenues largely depends on government entities adopting our business model. We cannot assure that government entities will choose to provide eGovernment services or continue to provide eGovernment services at current levels, or that they will provide such services with private assistance or by adopting our model. Generally, under our self-funded business model, we initially generate a high proportion of our revenues from a limited number of transaction-based services we provide on behalf of a limited number of government agencies within a state, as other agencies consider participating in the portal. The failure to secure contracts with certain government agencies, particularly those agencies that control motor vehicle driver history records, could result in revenue levels insufficient to support a portal\u2019s operations on a self-sustained, profitable basis. In addition, as there is a finite number of states remaining with which we can contract for our services, future increases in our revenues may depend, in part, on our ability to expand our business model to include multi-state cooperative organizations, local governments, and federal agencies and to broaden our service offerings to diversify our revenue streams across our lines of business. We cannot assure that we will succeed in expanding into new markets, broadening our service offerings, or that our services will be adaptable to those new markets.\nSome government partners may require specific government legislation to be passed for us to initiate and maintain our government contracts, and any failure to pass such legislation or any repeal or modification of or successful challenge to such legislation or changes in applicable law could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nBecause a central part of our business includes the execution of contracts with governments under which we remit a portion of user fees charged to businesses and citizens to state agencies, it is sometimes necessary for governments to draft and adopt specific legislation before the government can circulate a request for proposal (\u201cRFP\u201d) to which we can respond or can otherwise award such a contract. Furthermore, the maintenance of our government contracts requires the continued acceptance of our approach, including any enabling legislation and any implementing regulations. In the past, various entities that use the portals we operate to obtain government information have challenged the authority of governments to electronically provide these services exclusively through portals like those we operate, and other parties have challenged the contract awarding process in particular instances. A successful challenge in the future could result in a proliferation of alternative ways to obtain these services, which would harm our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. The repeal or modification of any enabling legislation, changes in applicable law or other legal challenge would also harm our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.\nWe earn a significant percentage of our revenues from a limited number of services and customers, and any reduction in demand for those services from those customers could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe obtain a high proportion of our revenues from a limited number of services. A significant portion of our revenues is derived from data resellers\u2019 use of our portals to access motor vehicle driver history records for the automobile insurance industry. Transaction-based fees charged for access to motor vehicle driver history records accounted for approximately 35% of our total consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014. One of these data resellers, LexisNexis Risk Solutions, accounted for approximately 24% of our total consolidated revenues during this period, or approximately three-quarters of our revenues from motor vehicle driver history records. This service is expected to continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues in the near future. However, regulatory changes or the development or increased use of alternative information sources, such as credit scoring, could materially reduce our revenues from this service. Our contracts with data resellers generally may be terminated at any time after a 60-day notice and may be terminated immediately at the option of any party in certain circumstances. A reduction in revenues from currently popular services would harm our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.\nWe could suffer significant losses and liability if our operations, systems or platforms are disrupted or fail to perform properly or effectively.\nThe continued efficiency and proper functionality of our technical systems, platforms, and operational infrastructure is integral to our performance. As we grow, we continue to purchase equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle increased traffic on our Internet-based portals. We may experience occasional system interruptions and delays that make our applications and eGovernment services unavailable or slow to respond and prevent businesses and citizens from accessing information and services on our government portals. Any such interruptions or delays in the future could cause users to stop visiting our government portals and could cause our government partners to penalize us or terminate agreements with us. Our operations, systems and platforms may also be disrupted or fail due to catastrophic events such as natural disasters, telecommunications failures, power outages, cyber-attacks, terrorist attacks, or other catastrophic events. If any of these circumstances occurred, our business could be harmed.\nThe Internet-based services for some of our portals and applications are physically hosted individually by the state or city where we provide services on servers that we typically own or lease. Our other portals and applications are hosted at a leased Computer Data Center (\u201cCDC\u201d) on servers that we own with a near real-time backup CDC located in a different geographic region of the country. CDC servers are virtually segmented by government partner while housing more than one government partner\u2019s services. An outage in one of the servers hosted outside one of the CDCs could affect that government partner\u2019s services. An outage at both of our leased CDCs, or at one CDC and to the connection to our backup facility, could affect more than one government partner\u2019s services. Any of these system failures could harm our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. Our insurance policies may not adequately compensate us for any losses that may occur due to any failures of or interruptions in our systems.\nOur portal revenues could be harmed as a result of government budget deficits.\nThe majority of our portal revenues are derived from fees we charge to users for transactions conducted through our portals and share with our government partners. Budget-strapped governments may seek to reduce our transaction revenues from our self-funded business model or our profit margin on transactions, or may decide to operate the portals themselves. In addition, approximately 5% of our portal revenues in 2014 were derived from time and materials-based fees for application development and approximately 3% of our portal revenues in 2014 were derived from fixed fees for portal management services, both of which are paid directly to us by governments. In the event of budget deficits, our government partners may be required to curtail discretionary spending on such projects and our portal revenues could be harmed.\nIf our rate of growth accelerates, we may not effectively manage our growth, which would adversely affect our business and our results of operations.\nOur growth rate may accelerate if we experience increased acceptance of our services under new or existing government contracts. If we cannot manage our growth effectively, we may not be able to coordinate the activities of our technical, accounting, and marketing staffs, and our business could be harmed. As part of our growth plan, we must implement new operational procedures and internal controls to expand, train, and manage our employees and to coordinate the operations of our various subsidiaries. If we cannot successfully implement eGovernment contracts that were recently awarded or may be awarded in the future in a timely and cost-effective manner or effectively manage the growth of our government portals, staff, software installation and maintenance teams, offices and operations, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nOur business will be adversely affected if we are unable to hire, integrate, train, or retain the qualified personnel that our business requires.\nOur future success will depend, in part, on the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees, most of whom have extensive experience with us and in our industry. The loss of any of our executives or key employees could harm our business. In addition, we currently expect that we will need to hire additional personnel in all areas throughout 2015, including personnel for new operations in jurisdictions in which we may obtain contracts. We may not be able to retain our current key employees or attract, integrate, or retain other qualified employees in the future. If we do not succeed in attracting new personnel or integrating, retaining, and motivating our current personnel, our business could be harmed. In addition, new employees generally require substantial training in the presentation, policies, and positioning of our government portals and other services. This training will require substantial resources and management attention.\nBecause a major portion of our accounts receivable is generated from a small number of users, negative trends in their businesses could cause us significant credit loss and negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nLexisNexis Risk Solutions and other data resellers that represent a significant portion of our business have a period of time, generally within 25 days of billing, to remit payment. As a result, we are subject to a significant concentration of credit risk that these users will not pay for their purchases. Our credit risk may increase due to liquidity or solvency issues experienced by these users. At December 31, 2014, LexisNexis Risk Solutions accounted for approximately 24% of our consolidated accounts receivable. In addition, our business is generally subject to the risk that our customers and counterparties will fail to meet their obligations when due. While we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers, we generally do not require collateral to secure accounts receivable. If we were unable to collect a major portion of our accounts receivable, we may suffer significant losses and our results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, and liquidity may be adversely affected.\nIncreases in credit/debit card association and automated clearing house fees may result in the loss of customers or a reduction in our earnings.\nFrom time to time, credit/debit card and electronic check processors increase the fees (interchange and assessment fees) that they charge companies such as us. We could attempt to pass these increases along to our government client customers, but this might result in the loss of those customers. If we elect not to pass along such increased fees to our government client customers in the future, we may have to absorb all or a portion of such increases thereby increasing our operating costs and reducing our earnings.\nWe may suffer substantial harm to our business if our government partners are not satisfied with our services or services provided by our third-party credit/debit card or electronic check processors.\nWe depend to a large extent on our relationships with our government partners, our reputation for high quality professional services and our commitment to preserving public trust to attract and retain customers. Through these relationships, we estimate that we processed over $20 billion of credit/debit card and electronic check payments for our government partners in 2014. As a result, if one of our government partners is not satisfied with our services or services provided by our third-party credit/debit card or electronic check processors, it may be more damaging to our business than to other businesses.\nWe depend on subcontractors or the third parties with whom we partner for certain projects, deliverables, or financial transaction processes. If these parties fail to satisfy their obligations to us or we are unable to maintain these relationships, our operating results and business prospects could be adversely affected.\nCertain large and complex projects and certain transactions require that we utilize subcontractors or that our services and solutions integrate with the software, systems, or infrastructure requirements of other vendors and service providers. Our ability to serve our clients and deliver and implement our solutions in a timely manner depends on our ability to retain and maintain relationships with subcontractors, vendors, and service providers and the ability of these subcontractors, vendors, and service providers to meet their obligations in a timely manner, as well as on our effective oversight of their performance. There is a risk that we may have disputes with our subcontractors arising from, among other things, the quality and timeliness of work performed by the subcontractors or customer concerns about the subcontractors. Disputes with subcontractors could lead to litigation. Adverse judgments or settlements in legal disputes may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against us. In addition, if any of our subcontractors fails to perform on a timely basis the agreed-upon services, our ability to fulfill our obligations as a prime contractor may be jeopardized. Subcontractor performance deficiencies could result in the termination of our contract for default. A termination for default could expose us to liability for damages and have an adverse effect on our business prospects, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition and our ability to compete for future contracts and orders.\nWe may become subject to liability under rules and standards for processing electronic direct debit payments from bank accounts and credit card payments.\nOur electronic check processing for online payments made by direct debit to a bank account is governed by rules and standards promulgated by the NACHA, an industry trade association of banking institutions and regional automated clearing house associations, and applicable law. Under those rules, we may become potentially liable for failing to handle transactions in accordance with those rules, or for failing to return funds within the prescribed time frame to the bank account of the person or entity disputing our authorization to debit those funds, before the dispute regarding our authorization is resolved. Our agreements with governmental agencies at the state, federal, and local levels transfer this obligation for rapid funds return during dispute resolution to the government agencies affected, but in the event that such return does not happen, we may be potentially liable notwithstanding the government\u2019s failure, and we may not be able to obtain reimbursement from the government involved or from the individual user or entity that initiated the debit without authorization. If this were to happen, our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition may be adversely affected. Our credit card and electronic check processing is also subject to the applicable rules of the particular card association or clearinghouse and applicable law. Additionally, in certain jurisdictions we are or may become subject to laws governing money transmitters and anti-money laundering for certain services we offer. If our interpretations, or those of our government partners, of any laws, rules, regulations, or standards are determined to be incorrect, we could be exposed to significant financial liability, substantial fines and penalties, cease and desist orders, and other sanctions that could restrict or eliminate our ability to provide certain of our services in one or more states or accept certain types of transactions in one or more states, or could force us to make costly changes to our business practices. Even if we are not forced to change our business practices, the costs of compliance and obtaining necessary licenses and regulatory approvals could be substantial.\nWe may become liable for violations of the Driver Privacy Protection Act as adopted federally or in each state.\nWe act as an outsourced manager on behalf of states, for electronic access to records pertaining to motor vehicles and motor vehicle operators (driver history records) by users and certain permitted resellers. These records are the largest group of records for which we process electronic access for state agencies, and are processed in the majority of our portal states. These records contain \u201cpersonal information\u201d and \u201csensitive personal information\u201d as defined by the federal Driver Privacy Protection Act, and state versions of that Act adopted in every state (collectively, the \u201cDPPA\u201d). The DPPA regulates categories and circumstances under which \u201cpersonal information\u201d and \u201csensitive personal information\u201d may be disclosed to requestors. Each state has procedures for complying with the DPPA, and such procedures may vary from state to state. We closely follow each respective state\u2019s existing compliance procedures for general access, with our electronic access. If we fail to follow such procedures, or we grant access to users not in compliance with such procedures, or if such procedures are deemed inadequate in some way, our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition may be adversely affected. The DPPA permits statutory damages to be awarded to the subjects of such records, even without proof of actual damage, for certain infringements or violations of the DPPA. We may be potentially liable for such damages in such instances, and we may have no recourse against the state, or the state may not be jointly and severally liable with us.\nWe may become liable for violations of the Safe, Accountable, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users if we disclose Pre-employment Screening Program (PSP) record data improperly.\nA federal law known as the Safe, Accountable, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (\u201cSAFETEA-LU\u201d) limits access to PSP record data to commercial driving operator applicants, their prospective employers, and the employers\u2019 agents, and can only be used in screening applicants for employment. Because the service is only useful if data access is quick and easy, we employ sophisticated systems of online agreements and validation information gathering, plus third party verification systems, to verify the identity and bona fides of any requestor. These systems may be incomplete or contain errors or omissions, or their operation may be flawed, resulting in improper disclosure or disclosure for an improper purpose or to improper persons. If we fail to follow appropriate procedures, or we grant access to users not in compliance with such procedures, or if such procedures are deemed inadequate in some way, we may become subject to monetary fines, penalties, or damages, and our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition may be adversely affected. Furthermore, the magnitude of the potential number of transactions accessed through our PSP service may result in monetary damages that are correspondingly large. In addition, any failure to comply with SAFETEA-LU may result in reputational damage.\nWe may become liable for violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act as adopted federally.\nOur PSP service for the FMCSA requires that PSP record data be disclosed in compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act (\u201cFCRA\u201d). We may also have other online services that are or become subject to the FCRA. If we fail to follow such procedures, or we grant access to users not in compliance with such procedures, or if such procedures are deemed inadequate in some way, or if other services we offer are deemed subject to the FCRA, we may become subject to monetary fines, penalties or damages, and our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition may be adversely affected. The FCRA permits statutory damages to be awarded to the subjects of such records, even without proof of actual damage, for certain infringements or violations of the FCRA. In addition, any failure to comply with the FCRA may result in reputational damage.\nCompliance with changing regulation of corporate governance, public disclosure and other regulatory requirements or industry standards may result in additional expenses.\nChanging laws, regulations, and standards relating to corporate governance, public disclosure and other regulatory requirements or industry standards, including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, new SEC regulations and NASDAQ Global Select Market rules, or Payment Card Industry standards are creating uncertainty for public companies such as ours. These new or changed laws, regulations, and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies, which could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We are committed to maintaining adequate and appropriate standards of corporate governance and public disclosure. As a result, our efforts to comply with evolving laws, regulations, and standards have resulted in, and certain regulations could continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. Further, as a result of increasing regulation, our board members and executive officers could face an increased risk of personal liability in connection with the performance of their duties. As a result, we may have difficulty attracting and retaining qualified board members and executive officers, which could harm our business. If our efforts to comply with new or changed laws, regulations, and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities in the laws themselves or related to practice, our reputation may be harmed.\nIf our competitors become more successful in developing and selling products for government-managed services, then our business could be adversely affected.\nThe principal alternative to our model is a government-designed and managed service that utilizes other vendors\u2019 technologies, products, and services. Companies that have expertise in marketing and providing technical electronic services to government entities compete with us by further developing their services and increasing their focus on this area of their businesses. Many of our potential competitors are national or international in scope and have greater resources than we do. These resources could enable our potential competitors to initiate severe price cuts or take other measures in an effort to gain market share. Additionally, in some geographic areas, we may face competition from smaller consulting firms with established reputations and political relationships with potential government partners. If we do not compete effectively or if we experience any pricing pressures, reduced profit margins or loss of market share resulting from increased competition, our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nOur intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could harm our company.\nWe regard our intellectual property as important to our success. We rely on a combination of nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements with governments, our employees, subcontractors, and other third parties, copyrights and privacy and trade secret laws to protect and limit the distribution of the proprietary applications, documentation and processes we have developed in connection with the eGovernment services we offer. Despite our precautions, third parties may succeed in misappropriating our intellectual property or independently developing similar intellectual property. If we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights and proprietary information or if we become involved in litigation relating to our intellectual property rights and proprietary technology, our business could be harmed. Any actions we take may not be adequate to protect our proprietary rights, and other companies may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our proprietary technology.\nThe fees we collect for many of our services are subject to government regulation that could limit growth of our revenues and profitability.\nUnder the terms of our self-funded outsourced government portal contracts, we remit a portion of the transaction fees we collect to state agencies. Generally, our contracts provide that the amount of any transaction fees we charge is set by governments to provide us with a reasonable return or profit. We have limited control over the level of transaction fees we are permitted to retain. Our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition may be harmed if the level of fees we are permitted to retain in the future is too low or if our costs rise without a commensurate increase in fees.\nBecause we have certain outsourced portal contracts that contain performance bond requirements and/or indemnification provisions, we may suffer monetary liability and damages if claims arise under such contracts. In addition, any failure to meet such obligations, whether or not a performance bond is in place, may result in reputational damage.\nWe are bound by performance bond commitments on certain outsourced portal contracts. Performance deficiencies by us or our subcontractors could result in a default of a performance bond, which could expose us to liability and have an adverse effect on our business prospects, on our financial condition, and on our ability to compete for future outsourced portal contracts. Further, under certain of our outsourced portal contracts, we are required to fully indemnify our government clients against claims arising from our performance or the performance of our subcontractors. If we fail to meet our contractual obligations, if our performance or our subcontractors\u2019 performance gives rise to claims, if our government partners are otherwise held liable for claims related to the services provided under our contracts, or if our government partners seek to hold us liable for claims or damages related to the services provided under our contracts, we could be subject to legal liability, monetary damages and loss of customer relationships.\nOur business will suffer if we lose the right to provide access to the content filed or distributed through our outsourced portals or we are held liable for the content that we pass to users from government entities.\nWe do not own or create the content filed or distributed through our outsourced portals. We depend on the governments with which we contract to supply information and data feeds to us on a timely basis to allow businesses and citizens to complete transactions and obtain government information. We cannot assure that these data sources will continue to be available in the future. Government entities could terminate their contracts to provide data. Changes in regulations could mean that governments no longer collect some types of data or that the data is protected by more stringent privacy rules preventing uses now made of it. Moreover, our data sources are not always subject to exclusive agreements, so that data included in our services also may be included in those of our potential competitors. In addition, we depend upon the accuracy and reliability of government computer systems and data collection for the content distributed through our portals. The loss, unavailability, or inaccuracy of our data sources in the future, or the loss of our exclusive right to distribute some of the data sources, could harm our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.\nBecause we aggregate and distribute sometimes private and sensitive public information over the Internet, we may face potential liability for defamation, libel, negligence, invasion of privacy, copyright or trademark infringement, and other claims based on the nature and content of the material that is published on or distributed through our outsourced government portals. Most of the agreements through which we obtain consent to disseminate this information do not contain indemnity provisions in our favor. These types of claims have been brought, sometimes successfully, against online services and websites in the past. We cannot assure that our general liability or errors and omissions insurance will be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed. Any liability that is not covered by our insurance or is in excess of our insurance coverage could severely harm our business operations and financial condition.\nBecause a large portion of our business relies on a contractual bidding process whose parameters are established by governments, the length of our sales cycles is uncertain and could lead to shortfalls in our financial results for a particular period and harm our financial condition.\nOur dependence on a bidding process to initiate many new projects, the parameters of which are established by governments, results in uncertainty in our sales cycles because the duration and the procedures for each bidding process vary significantly according to each government entity\u2019s policies and procedures. The time between the date of initial contact with a government for a bid and the award of the bid may range from as little as 180 days to up to several years. The bidding process is subject to factors, over which we have little or no control, including:\n\u25cf\npolitical acceptance of the concept of government agencies contracting with third parties to receive or distribute public information, which has been offered traditionally only by the government agencies and often without charge;\n\u25cf\nthe internal review process by the government agencies for bid acceptance;\n\u25cf\nthe need to reach a political accommodation among various interest groups;\n\u25cf\nchanges to the bidding procedure by the government agencies;\n\u25cf\nchanges to state legislation authorizing government\u2019s contracting with third parties to receive or distribute public information;\n\u25cf\nchanges in government administrations;\n\u25cf\nthe budgetary restrictions of government entities;\n\u25cf\nthe competition generated by the bidding process;\n\u25cf\nthe possibility of cancellation or delay by the government entities; and\n\u25cf\ngovernment\u2019s manner of drafting bid documents, which may partially, or not at all, utilize our method of providing eGovernment services.\nWe depend on the bidding process for a significant part of our business. Therefore, any material delay in the bidding process, changes to bidding practices and policies, the failure to receive the award of a bid, or the failure to execute a contract may disrupt our financial results for a particular period and harm our financial condition.\nWe may need more working capital to fund operations and expand our business, and any failure to obtain such needed working capital would adversely affect our business.\nWe believe that our current financial resources and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our present working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months. However, we may need to raise additional capital before this period ends to further:\n\u25cf\nfund operations, if unforeseen costs or revenue shortfalls arise;\n\u25cf\nsupport our expansion into other states and government agencies beyond what is contemplated in 2015 if unforeseen opportunities arise;\n\u25cf\nexpand our product and service offerings beyond what is contemplated in 2015 if unforeseen opportunities arise;\n\u25cf\nrespond to unforeseen competitive pressures; and\n\u25cf\nacquire technologies beyond what is contemplated.\nOur future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors, including the success of our existing and new service offerings and potentially competing technological and market developments. However, any projections of future cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. If current cash, lines of credit, and cash generated from operations are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements, we may seek to sell additional equity securities, issue debt securities, or draw on the unused portion of our line of credit. The sale of additional equity securities could result in dilution to our stockholders. From time to time, we expect to evaluate the acquisition of or investment in businesses and technologies that complement our various eGovernment businesses. Acquisitions or investments might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to sell additional equity securities or issue debt securities. There can be no assurance that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If adequate funds were not available on acceptable terms, our ability to develop or enhance our applications and services, take advantage of future opportunities, or respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited. This limitation could harm our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.\nThe seasonality of use for some of our eGovernment services may harm our quarterly results.\nThe use of some of our eGovernment services is seasonal, particularly the accessing of motor vehicle driver history records, resulting in lower revenues from this service under existing portal contracts in the fourth quarter of each calendar year, due to the smaller number of business days in this quarter and a lower volume of transactions during the holiday periods.\nOur quarterly results of operations may be volatile and difficult to predict. If our quarterly results of operations fail to meet the expectations of public market analysts or investors, the market price of our common stock may decrease significantly.\nOur future revenues and results of operations may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control, and any of which may harm our business. These factors include:\n\u25cf\nthe commencement, completion, or termination of contracts during any particular quarter;\n\u25cf\nthe introduction of new eGovernment services by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf\ntechnical difficulties or system downtime affecting the operation of our eGovernment services;\n\u25cf\nthe amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to the expansion of our business operations and infrastructure;\n\u25cf\nchanges in economic conditions;\n\u25cf\nthe result of negative cash flows due to capital investments; and\n\u25cf\nthe incurrence of significant charges related to acquisitions.\nDue to the factors noted above and the other factors described in these Risk Factors, our financial performance in a particular quarter may be lower than we anticipate and if we are unable to reduce spending in that quarter, our results of operations for that quarter may be harmed. One should not rely on quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of future performance. It is possible that in some future periods our results of operations may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors. If this occurs, the price of our common stock may decline.\nWe may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims, which are costly to defend and could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future.\nWe may become subject to claims alleging infringement of third-party intellectual property rights. Our portal contracts require us to indemnify our government partners for infringing software we build or use. Any claims could subject us to costly litigation, and may require us to pay damages and develop non-infringing intellectual property or acquire licenses to the intellectual property that is the subject of the alleged infringement. Licenses for such intellectual property may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. Litigation regarding intellectual property rights is common in the Internet and software industries. We expect third-party infringement claims involving Internet technologies and software products and services to increase. If an infringement claim is filed against us, we may be prevented from using certain technologies and may incur significant costs resolving the claim. We cannot assure that our applications and services do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties. In addition, we have agreed, and expect that we may agree in the future, to indemnify certain of our customers against claims that our services infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others. We could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves and our customers against infringement claims. In the event of a claim of infringement, we and our customers may be required to obtain one or more licenses from third parties. We cannot assure that we or our customers could obtain necessary licenses from third parties at a reasonable cost or at all.\nWe depend on technology licensed to us by third parties, and the loss of access to, or improper management of the licensing of this technology could delay implementation of our services or force us to pay higher license fees or fines.\nWe license numerous third-party technologies and applications that we incorporate into our existing service offerings, and on which, in the aggregate, we are substantially dependent. There can be no assurance that the licenses for such third-party technologies will not be terminated or that we will be able to license third-party technology and applications for future services. While we do not believe that one individual technology or application we license is material to our business, changes in or the loss of third party licenses could lead to a material increase in the costs of licensing, or to our products becoming inoperable or their performance being materially reduced. The result could be that we may need to incur additional development or procurement costs in an attempt to ensure continued performance of our services, and either the cost of such undertakings or the failure to successfully complete such undertakings could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. Additionally, because of the decentralized nature of our operations, licensing of third party technology can be complex and difficult to track and continually monitor. Our inability to do so could result in fines, an increase in licensing fees, or the temporary inability to utilize the third party technology until licensing issues are resolved.\nWe are subject to independent audits as requested by our government customers. Deficiencies in our performance under a government contract could result in contract termination, reputational damage, or financial penalties.\nEach government entity with which we contract for outsourced portal services has the authority to require an independent audit of our performance and financial management of contracted operations in each respective state. The scope of audits could include inspections of income statements, balance sheets, fee structures, collections practices, service levels, security practices, and our compliance with contract provisions and applicable laws, regulations, and standards. We cannot assure that a future audit will not find any material performance deficiencies that would result in an adjustment to our revenues and result in financial penalties. Moreover, the consequent negative publicity could harm our reputation among other governments with which we would like to contract. All of these factors could harm our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.\nA prolonged economic slowdown could harm our operations.\nA prolonged economic slowdown or recession could materially impact our operations to the extent it results in reduced demand for Internet-based access to governmental services. In addition, it may hinder our efforts to obtain new business by distracting the attention of governments or impairing the ability of governments to hear or act upon our value proposition due to reduced personnel or turnover. These same factors may also jeopardize our renewal or rebid opportunities on existing contracts. If current market and economic conditions deteriorate, we may experience adverse impacts on our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.\nOur cash could be adversely affected if any of the financial institutions in which we hold our cash fails or becomes subject to other adverse conditions in the financial or credit markets.\nOur cash primarily includes cash on hand in the form of bank deposits. We maintain our cash with major financial institutions. Deposits with these financial institutions exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\u201cFDIC\u201d) insurance limits. At December 31, 2014, the amount of cash covered by FDIC deposit insurance was $10.6 million, and $77.4 million of cash was above the FDIC deposit insurance limits. These balances could be affected if one or more of the financial institutions with which we deposit funds fails or becomes subject to other adverse conditions in the financial or credit markets. To date, we have experienced no loss or lack of access to our cash; however, we can provide no assurance that access to our cash will not be impacted or that we will not lose deposited funds in excess of FDIC insurance limits as a result of the failure or insolvency of any these financial institutions or adverse conditions in the financial and credit markets.\nWe may be unable to integrate new technologies and industry standards effectively, which may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur future success will depend on our ability to enhance and improve the responsiveness, functionality, and features of our services in accordance with industry standards and to address the increasingly sophisticated technological needs of our customers on a cost-effective and timely basis. Our ability to remain competitive will depend, in part, on our ability to:\n\u25cf\nenhance and improve the responsiveness, functionality, and other features of the government portals we offer;\n\u25cf\ncontinue to develop our technical expertise;\n\u25cf\ndevelop and introduce new services, applications, and technology to meet changing customer needs and preferences; and\n\u25cf\ninfluence and respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes in a timely and cost-effective manner.\nWe cannot assure that we will be successful in responding to the above technological and industry challenges in a timely and cost-effective manner. If we are unable to integrate new technologies and industry standards effectively, our business could be harmed.\nOur strategic alliances and potential acquisitions may entail numerous risks and uncertainties which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nAs part of our business strategy, we have made and may continue to enter into strategic alliances or to make acquisitions that we believe will complement our existing businesses, increase traffic to our government partners\u2019 sites, enhance our services, broaden our software and applications offerings or technological capabilities, or increase our profitability. Future alliances or acquisitions could present numerous risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u25cf\nthe inability to successfully market, distribute, deploy, and manage new products and services that we have limited or no experience in managing;\n\u25cf\nthe diversion of management\u2019s attention from our core business;\n\u25cf\nrisks associated with entering markets in which we have limited or no experience;\n\u25cf\nadverse effects on existing business relationships with existing suppliers and customers;\n\u25cf\nerosion of our brand equity in the eGovernment or financial markets;\n\u25cf\ndifficulties in the assimilation of operations, personnel, technologies, and information systems of the acquired companies;\n\u25cf\nthe risk that an acquired business will not perform as expected or will have profit margins significantly lower than ours;\n\u25cf\npotential loss of key employees, particularly those of acquired businesses;\n\u25cf\npotentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, which may be freely tradable in the public market;\n\u25cf\nimpairment, restructuring, and other charges related to goodwill and other long-lived intangible assets; and\n\u25cf the incurrence of debt and related interest and other expenses.\nWe cannot assure that we will be able to successfully integrate products or technologies of strategic alliances or new businesses we may acquire in the future. We also may not realize cost efficiencies or synergies that we anticipate.", "PERMNO": 87066, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "EGOV"}
