Risk Factors\nFor an enterprise as large and complex as the Company, a wide range of factors could materially affect future developments and performance. In addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in connection with the description of these operations and the financial results of these operations elsewhere in this report, the most significant factors affecting our operations include the following:\nChanges in U.S., global, or regional economic conditions could have an adverse effect on the profitability of some or all of our businesses.\nA decline in economic activity in the U.S. and other regions of the world in which we do business can adversely affect demand for any of our businesses, thus reducing our revenue and earnings. Past declines in economic conditions reduced spending at our parks and resorts, purchase of and prices for advertising on our broadcast and cable networks and owned stations, performance of our home entertainment releases, and purchases of Company-branded consumer products, and similar impacts can be expected should such conditions recur. A decline in economic conditions could also reduce attendance at our parks and resorts, prices that MVPDs pay for our cable programming or subscription levels for our cable programming. Economic conditions can also impair the ability of those with whom we do business to satisfy their obligations to us. In addition, an increase in price levels generally, or in price levels in a particular sector such as the energy sector, could result in a shift in consumer demand away from the entertainment and consumer products we offer, which could also adversely affect our revenues and, at the same time, increase our costs. Changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies may reduce international demand for our products or increase our labor or supply costs in non-U.S. markets, and recent changes have reduced the U.S. dollar value of revenue we receive and expect to receive from other markets. Economic or political conditions in a country could also reduce our ability to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in the country or our ability to repatriate revenue from the country.\nChanges in public and consumer tastes and preferences for entertainment and consumer products could reduce demand for our entertainment offerings and products and adversely affect the profitability of any of our businesses.\nOur businesses create entertainment, travel and consumer products whose success depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that change in often unpredictable ways. The success of our businesses depends on our ability to consistently create filmed entertainment and television programming, which may be distributed among other ways through broadcast, cable, internet or cellular technology, theme park attractions, hotels and other resort facilities and travel experiences and consumer products that meet the changing preferences of the broad consumer market and respond to competition from an expanding array of choices facilitated by technological developments in the delivery of content. Many of our businesses increasingly depend on acceptance of our offerings and products by consumers outside the U.S., and their success therefore depends on our ability to successfully predict and adapt to changing consumer tastes and preferences outside as well as inside the U.S. Moreover, we must often invest substantial amounts in film production, television programming, acquisition of sports rights, theme park attractions, cruise ships or hotels and other resort facilities before we know the extent to which these products will earn consumer acceptance. If our entertainment offerings and products do not achieve sufficient consumer acceptance, our revenue from advertising sales (which are based in part on ratings for the programs in which advertisements air), from affiliate fees, from subscription fees, from theatrical film receipts, from the license of rights to other distributors, from theme park admissions, from hotel room charges and merchandise, from food and beverage sales, from sales of licensed consumer products or from sales of our other consumer products and services, may decline or fail to grow to the extent we anticipate when making investment decisions and thereby adversely affect the profitability of one or more of our businesses.\nChanges in technology and in consumer consumption patterns may affect demand for our entertainment products, the revenue we can generate from these products or the cost of producing or distributing products.\nThe media entertainment and internet businesses in which we participate increasingly depend on our ability to successfully adapt to shifting patterns of content consumption through the adoption and exploitation of new technologies. New technologies affect the demand for our products, the manner in which our products are distributed to consumers, ways we charge for and receive revenue for our entertainment products and the stability of those revenue streams, the sources and nature of competing content offerings, the time and manner in which consumers acquire and view some of our entertainment products and the options available to advertisers for reaching their desired audiences. This trend has impacted the business model for certain traditional forms of distribution, as evidenced by the industry-wide decline in ratings for broadcast television, the reduction in demand for home entertainment sales of theatrical content, the development of alternative distribution channels for broadcast and cable programming and declines in subscriber levels for traditional cable channels, including for a number of our networks. In order to respond to these developments, we regularly consider and from time to time implement changes to our business models, most recently by developing DTC products for certain sports programming on ESPN+ (launched in 2018) and for filmed entertainment and other programming on Disney+ (to be launched in 2019). There can be no assurance that our DTC offerings and other efforts will successfully respond to these changes, and we expect to forgo revenue from traditional sources in the short term. There can be no assurance that the DTC model and other business models we may develop will ultimately be as profitable as our current business models.\nThe success of our businesses is highly dependent on the existence and maintenance of intellectual property rights in the entertainment products and services we create.\nThe value to us of our intellectual property rights is dependent on the scope and duration of our rights as defined by applicable laws in the U.S. and abroad and the manner in which those laws are construed. If those laws are drafted or\ninterpreted in ways that limit the extent or duration of our rights, or if existing laws are changed, our ability to generate revenue from our intellectual property may decrease, or the cost of obtaining and maintaining rights may increase.\nThe unauthorized use of our intellectual property may increase the cost of protecting rights in our intellectual property or reduce our revenues. The convergence of computing, communication, and entertainment devices, increased broadband internet speed and penetration, increased availability and speed of mobile data transmission and increasingly sophisticated attempts to obtain unauthorized access to data systems have made the unauthorized digital copying and distribution of our films, television productions and other creative works easier and faster and protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights more challenging. The unauthorized distribution and access to entertainment content generally continues to be a significant challenge for intellectual property rights holders. Inadequate laws or weak enforcement mechanisms to protect entertainment industry intellectual property in one country can adversely affect the results of the Company\u2019s operations worldwide, despite the Company\u2019s efforts to protect its intellectual property rights. These developments require us to devote substantial resources to protecting our intellectual property against unlicensed use and present the risk of increased losses of revenue as a result of unlicensed distribution of our content.\nWith respect to intellectual property developed by the Company and rights acquired by the Company from others, the Company is subject to the risk of challenges to our copyright, trademark and patent rights by third parties. Successful challenges to our rights in intellectual property may result in increased costs for obtaining rights or the loss of the opportunity to earn revenue from the intellectual property that is the subject of challenged rights.\nProtection of electronically stored data is costly and if our data is compromised in spite of this protection, we may incur additional costs, lost opportunities and damage to our reputation.\nWe maintain information necessary to conduct our business, including confidential and proprietary information as well as personal information regarding our customers and employees, in digital form. Data maintained in digital form is subject to the risk of unauthorized access, modification and exfiltration. We develop and maintain information security systems in an effort to prevent this, but the development and maintenance of these systems is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. Accordingly, despite our efforts, unauthorized access, modification and exfiltration of data cannot be eliminated entirely, and the risks associated with a potentially material incident remain. In addition, we provide confidential, proprietary and personal information to third parties when it is necessary to pursue business objectives. While we obtain assurances that these third parties will protect this information and, where we believe appropriate, monitor the protections employed by these third parties, there is a risk the confidentiality of data held by third parties may be compromised. If our information security systems or data are compromised in a material way, our ability to conduct our business may be impaired, we may lose profitable opportunities or the value of those opportunities may be diminished and, as described above, we may lose revenue as a result of unlicensed use of our intellectual property. If personal information of our customers or employees is misappropriated, our reputation with our customers and employees may be damaged resulting in loss of business or morale, and we may incur costs to remediate possible harm to our customers and employees and/or to pay fines or take other action with respect to judicial or regulatory actions arising out of the incident.\nA variety of uncontrollable events may reduce demand for our products and services, impair our ability to provide our products and services or increase the cost of providing our products and services.\nDemand for our products and services, particularly our theme parks and resorts, is highly dependent on the general environment for travel and tourism. The environment for travel and tourism, as well as demand for other entertainment products, can be significantly adversely affected in the U.S., globally or in specific regions as a result of a variety of factors beyond our control, including: adverse weather conditions arising from short-term weather patterns or long-term change, catastrophic events or natural disasters (such as excessive heat or rain, hurricanes, typhoons, floods, tsunamis and earthquakes); health concerns; international, political or military developments; and terrorist attacks. These events and others, such as fluctuations in travel and energy costs and computer virus attacks, intrusions or other widespread computing or telecommunications failures, may also damage our ability to provide our products and services or to obtain insurance coverage with respect to these events. An incident that affected our property directly would have a direct impact on our ability to provide goods and services and could have an extended effect of discouraging consumers from attending our facilities. Moreover, the costs of protecting against such incidents reduces the profitability of our operations.\nIn addition, we derive affiliate fees and royalties from the distribution of our programming, sales of our licensed goods and services by third parties, and the management of businesses operated under brands licensed from the Company, and we are therefore dependent on the successes of those third parties for that portion of our revenue. A wide variety of factors could influence the success of those third parties and if negative factors significantly impacted a sufficient number of those third parties, the profitability of one or more of our businesses could be adversely affected.\nWe obtain insurance against the risk of losses relating to some of these events, generally including physical damage to our property and resulting business interruption, certain injuries occurring on our property and some liabilities for alleged\nbreach of legal responsibilities. When insurance is obtained it is subject to deductibles, exclusions, terms, conditions and limits of liability. The types and levels of coverage we obtain vary from time to time depending on our view of the likelihood of specific types and levels of loss in relation to the cost of obtaining coverage for such types and levels of loss.\nChanges in our business strategy or restructuring of our businesses may increase our costs or otherwise affect the profitability of our businesses.\nAs changes in our business environment occur we may adjust our business strategies to meet these changes or we may otherwise decide to restructure our operations or particular businesses or assets. In addition, external events including changing technology, changing consumer patterns, acceptance of our theatrical offerings and changes in macroeconomic conditions may impair the value of our assets. When these changes or events occur, we may incur costs to change our business strategy and may need to write down the value of assets. We also make investments in existing or new businesses, including investments in international expansion of our business and in new business lines. In recent years, such investments have included expansion and renovation of certain of our theme park attractions, investment in Shanghai Disney Resort and investments related to direct-to-consumer offerings of sports and other entertainment products. Some of these investments may have short-term returns that are negative or low and the ultimate business prospects of the businesses may be uncertain. In any of these events, our costs may increase, we may have significant charges associated with the write-down of assets or returns on new investments may be lower than prior to the change in strategy or restructuring.\nIncreased competitive pressures may reduce our revenues or increase our costs.\nWe face substantial competition in each of our businesses from alternative providers of the products and services we offer and from other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreational activities. This includes competition for human resources, programming and other resources we require in operating our business. For example:\n\u2022\nOur studio operations and media businesses compete to obtain creative, performing and business talent, sports and other programming, story properties, advertiser support and market share with other studio operations, broadcast and cable networks, SVOD providers, and other new sources of broadband delivered content.\n\u2022\nOur broadcast and cable networks and stations compete for the sale of advertising time with other broadcast, cable and satellite services, as well as with newspapers, magazines, billboards and radio stations. In addition, we increasingly face competition for advertising sales from internet and mobile delivered content, which offer advertising delivery technologies that are more targeted than can be achieved through traditional means.\n\u2022\nOur cable networks compete for carriage of their programming with other programming providers.\n\u2022\nOur theme parks and resorts compete for guests with all other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreation activities.\n\u2022\nOur studio operations compete for customers with all other forms of entertainment.\n\u2022\nOur interactive media operations compete with other licensors and publishers of console, online and mobile games and other types of home entertainment.\nCompetition in each of these areas may increase as a result of technological developments and changes in market structure, including consolidation of suppliers of resources and distribution channels. Increased competition may divert consumers from our creative or other products, or to other products or other forms of entertainment, which could reduce our revenue or increase our marketing costs. Competition for the acquisition of resources can increase the cost of producing our products and services or deprive us of talent necessary to produce high quality creative material. Such competition may also reduce, or limit growth in, prices for our products and services, including advertising rates and subscription fees at our media networks, parks and resorts admissions and room rates, and prices for consumer products from which we derive license revenues\nTurmoil in the financial markets could increase our cost of borrowing and impede access to or increase the cost of financing our operations and investments.\nPast disruptions in the U.S. and global credit and equity markets made it difficult for many businesses to obtain financing on acceptable terms. These conditions tended to increase the cost of borrowing and if they recur, our cost of borrowing could increase and it may be more difficult to obtain financing for our operations or investments. In addition, our borrowing costs can be affected by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies that are based, in part, on the Company\u2019s performance as measured by credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios. A decrease in these ratings would likely increase our cost of borrowing and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing. Past disruptions in the global financial markets also impacted some of the financial institutions with which we do business. A similar decline in the financial stability of financial institutions could affect our ability to secure credit-worthy counterparties for our interest rate and foreign currency hedging programs, could affect our ability to settle existing contracts and could also affect the ability of our business customers to obtain financing and thereby to satisfy their obligations to us.\nSustained increases in costs of pension and postretirement medical and other employee health and welfare benefits may reduce our profitability.\nWith approximately 201,000 employees, our profitability is substantially affected by costs of pension benefits and current and postretirement medical benefits. We may experience significant increases in these costs as a result of macro-economic factors, which are beyond our control, including increases in the cost of health care. In addition, changes in investment returns and discount rates used to calculate pension expense and related assets and liabilities can be volatile and may have an unfavorable impact on our costs in some years. These macroeconomic factors as well as a decline in the fair value of pension and postretirement medical plan assets may put upward pressure on the cost of providing pension and postretirement medical benefits and may increase future funding requirements. Although we have actively sought to control increases in these costs, there can be no assurance that we will succeed in limiting cost increases, and continued upward pressure could reduce the profitability of our businesses.\nOur results may be adversely affected if long-term programming or carriage contracts are not renewed on sufficiently favorable terms.\nWe enter into long-term contracts for both the acquisition and the distribution of media programming and products, including contracts for the acquisition of programming rights for sporting events and other programs, and contracts for the distribution of our programming to content distributors. As these contracts expire, we must renew or renegotiate the contracts, and if we are unable to renew them on acceptable terms, we may lose programming rights or distribution rights. Even if these contracts are renewed, the cost of obtaining programming rights may increase (or increase at faster rates than our historical experience) or programming distributors, facing pressures resulting from increased subscription fees and alternative distribution challenges, may demand terms (including pricing and the breadth of distribution) that reduce our revenue from distribution of programs (or increase revenue at slower rates than our historical experience). Moreover, our ability to renew these contracts on favorable terms may be affected by recent consolidation in the market for program distribution and the entrance of new participants in the market for distribution of content on digital platforms. With respect to the acquisition of programming rights, particularly sports programming rights, the impact of these long-term contracts on our results over the term of the contracts depends on a number of factors, including the strength of advertising markets, subscription levels and rates for programming, effectiveness of marketing efforts and the size of viewer audiences. There can be no assurance that revenues from programming based on these rights will exceed the cost of the rights plus the other costs of producing and distributing the programming.\nChanges in regulations applicable to our businesses may impair the profitability of our businesses.\nOur broadcast networks and television stations are highly regulated, and each of our other businesses is subject to a variety of U.S. and overseas regulations. These regulations include:\n\u2022\nU.S. FCC regulation of our television and radio networks, our national programming networks and our owned television stations. See Item 1 - Business - Media Networks, Federal Regulation.\n\u2022\nFederal, state and foreign privacy and data protection laws and regulations.\n\u2022\nRegulation of the safety of consumer products and theme park operations.\n\u2022\nEnvironmental protection regulations.\n\u2022\nImposition by foreign countries of trade restrictions, restrictions on the manner in which content is currently licensed and distributed, ownership restrictions, currency exchange controls or motion picture or television content requirements or quotas.\n\u2022\nDomestic and international wage laws, tax laws or currency controls.\nChanges in any of these regulations or regulatory activities in any of these areas may require us to spend additional amounts to comply with the regulations, or may restrict our ability to offer products and services in ways that are profitable.\nOur operations outside the United States may be adversely affected by the operation of laws in those jurisdictions.\nOur operations in non-U.S. jurisdictions are in many cases subject to the laws of the jurisdictions in which they operate rather than U.S. law. Laws in some jurisdictions differ in significant respects from those in the U.S. These differences can affect our ability to react to changes in our business, and our rights or ability to enforce rights may be different than would be expected under U.S. law. Moreover, enforcement of laws in some overseas jurisdictions can be inconsistent and unpredictable, which can affect both our ability to enforce our rights and to undertake activities that we believe are beneficial to our business. In addition, the business and political climate in some jurisdictions may encourage corruption, which could reduce our ability to compete successfully in those jurisdictions while remaining in compliance with local laws or United States anti-corruption laws applicable to our businesses. As a result, our ability to generate revenue and our expenses in non-U.S. jurisdictions may differ from what would be expected if U.S. law governed these operations.\nLabor disputes may disrupt our operations and adversely affect the profitability of any of our businesses.\nA significant number of employees in various of our businesses are covered by collective bargaining agreements, including employees of our theme parks and resorts as well as writers, directors, actors, production personnel and others employed in our media networks and studio operations. In addition, the employees of licensees who manufacture and retailers who sell our consumer products, and employees of providers of programming content (such as sports leagues) may be covered by labor agreements with their employers. In general, a labor dispute involving our employees or the employees of our licensees or retailers who sell our consumer products or providers of programming content may disrupt our operations and reduce our revenues, and resolution of disputes may increase our costs.\nThe seasonality of certain of our businesses could exacerbate negative impacts on our operations.\nEach of our businesses is normally subject to seasonal variations, as follows:\n\u2022\nRevenues in our Media Networks segment are subject to seasonal advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels. In general, advertising revenues are somewhat higher during the fall and somewhat lower during the summer months. Affiliate fees are typically collected ratably throughout the year.\n\u2022\nRevenues in our Parks and Resorts segment fluctuate with changes in theme park attendance and resort occupancy resulting from the seasonal nature of vacation travel and leisure activities. Peak attendance and resort occupancy generally occur during the summer months when school vacations occur and during early-winter and spring-holiday periods.\n\u2022\nRevenues in our Studio Entertainment segment fluctuate due to the timing and performance of releases in the theatrical, home entertainment and television markets. Release dates are determined by several factors, including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods.\n\u2022\nRevenues in our Consumer Products & Interactive Media segment are influenced by seasonal consumer purchasing behavior, which generally results in higher revenues during the Company\u2019s first and fourth fiscal quarters, and by the timing and performance of theatrical and game releases and cable programming broadcasts.\nAccordingly, if a short-term negative impact on our business occurs during a time of high seasonal demand (such as hurricane damage to our parks during the summer travel season), the effect could have a disproportionate effect on the results of that business for the year.\nRisk Factors Related to the Acquisition of 21CF\nThe proposed Acquisition of 21CF may cause disruption in our business.\nThe merger agreement related to the acquisition of 21CF (the \u201cAcquisition\u201d) restricts us from taking certain specified actions without 21CF\u2019s consent until the Acquisition is completed or the merger agreement is terminated, including making certain acquisitions to the extent that the acquisition would reasonably be expected to prevent, materially delay or materially impair the completion of the Acquisition, and from paying dividends in excess of certain thresholds. These restrictions may affect our ability to execute our business strategies and attain our financial and other goals and may impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe proposed Acquisition could cause disruptions to our business or business relationships, which could have an adverse impact on results of operations. Parties with which we have business relationships may experience uncertainty as to the future of such relationships and may delay or defer certain business decisions, seek alternative relationships with third parties or seek to alter their present business relationships with us. Parties with whom we otherwise may have sought to establish business relationships may seek alternative relationships with third parties.\nThe pursuit of the Acquisition and the preparation for the integration of 21CF may place a significant burden on our management and internal resources. The diversion of management\u2019s attention away from day-to-day business concerns and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs, expenses and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the Acquisition. We may also incur unanticipated costs in the integration of the businesses of 21CF and Disney. The substantial majority of these costs will be non-recurring expenses relating to the Acquisition, and many of these costs are payable regardless of whether or not the Acquisition is consummated. We also could be subject to litigation related to the proposed Acquisition, which could result in significant costs and expenses.\nFailure to complete the Acquisition in a timely manner or at all could negatively impact the market price of our common stock, as well as our future business and our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe currently anticipate the Acquisition will be completed in the first half of calendar year 2019, but we cannot be certain when or if the conditions for the Acquisition will be satisfied or (if permissible under applicable law) waived. The Acquisition cannot be completed until the conditions to closing are satisfied or (if permissible under applicable law) waived, including (i) receipt of certain required governmental approvals and consents, (ii) receipt by 21CF of a surplus and solvency opinion with\nrespect to the separation of the 21CF assets and liabilities that we are not acquiring in the Acquisition, referred to as the separation, and the cash dividend in connection with the Acquisition, (iii) the registration of the common stock of a newly formed subsidiary of 21CF, referred to as New Fox, that is contemplated to own the 21CF assets and liabilities that we are not acquiring in the Acquisition and which will be spun off to 21CF stockholders, (iv) authorization of Disney and New Fox shares for listing on NYSE or NASDAQ, as applicable, (v) the consummation of the separation and spin off of New Fox to 21CF stockholders, (vi) receipt of certain tax opinions by each of 21CF and Disney, including tax opinions regarding the intended tax treatment of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and (vii ) the accuracy of the representations and warranties made by 21CF or Disney, as applicable, in the merger agreement. Our obligation to complete the Acquisition is also subject to, among other conditions, the absence of regulatory authorities requiring certain actions on our part. The satisfaction of the required conditions could delay the completion of the Acquisition for a significant period of time or prevent it from occurring. Further, there can be no assurance that the conditions to the closing of the Acquisition will be satisfied or waived or that the Acquisition will be completed.\nIf the Acquisition is not completed in a timely manner or at all, our business may be adversely affected as follows:\n\u2022\nwe may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, and our stock price could decline to the extent that the current market price reflects an assumption that the Acquisition will be completed;\n\u2022\nwe may experience negative reactions from employees, customers, suppliers or other third parties;\n\u2022\nmanagement\u2019s focus may have been diverted from pursuing other opportunities that could have been beneficial to Disney; and\n\u2022\nour costs of pursuing the Acquisition may be higher than anticipated.\nIn addition to the above risks, we may be required, under certain circumstances, to pay 21CF a termination fee equal to $1.525 billion, or in connection with a termination under certain specified circumstances in connection with the failure to obtain regulatory approvals, $2.5 billion. If the Acquisition is not consummated, there can be no assurance that these risks will not materialize and will not materially adversely affect our stock price, business, financial conditions, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe Acquisition may not be accretive, and may be dilutive, to our earnings per share, which may negatively affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe currently expect the Acquisition to be accretive to our earnings per share, excluding the impact of purchase accounting, in fiscal 2021 assuming the Acquisition closes in fiscal 2019. This expectation, however, is based on preliminary estimates that may materially change. In addition, we could fail to realize all of the benefits anticipated in the Acquisition or experience delays or inefficiencies in realizing such benefits. Such factors could, combined with the issuance of shares of our common stock in connection with the Acquisition, result in the Acquisition being dilutive to our earnings per share, which could negatively affect the market price of our common stock.\nIn order to complete the Acquisition, Disney and 21CF must obtain certain governmental approvals, and if such approvals are not granted or are granted with conditions, completion of the Acquisition may be jeopardized or the anticipated benefits of the Acquisition could be reduced.\nAlthough Disney and 21CF have agreed to use reasonable best efforts, subject to certain limitations, to make certain governmental filings and obtain the required governmental approvals or expiration or earlier termination of relevant waiting periods, as the case may be, there can be no assurance that the relevant waiting periods will expire or be terminated or that the relevant approvals will be obtained. As a condition to approving the Acquisition, these governmental authorities may impose conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions or require divestitures or place restrictions on the conduct of our business after completion of the Acquisition. There can be no assurance that regulators will not impose conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions and that such conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions will not have the effect of delaying or preventing completion of the Acquisition or imposing additional material costs on or materially limiting the revenues of the combined company following the Acquisition, or otherwise adversely affecting, including to a material extent, our businesses and results of operations after completion of the Acquisition. If we or 21CF are required to divest assets or businesses, there can be no assurance that we or 21CF will be able to negotiate such divestitures expeditiously or on favorable terms or that the governmental authorities will approve the terms of such divestitures. We can provide no assurance that these conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions will not result in the abandonment of the Acquisition.\nWe will be required to divest the 21CF regional sports networks (the \u201c21CF RSNs\u201d) and we may not be able to negotiate such divestitures expeditiously or on favorable terms.\nOn June 27, 2018, the U.S. Department of Justice (the \u201cDOJ\u201d) submitted a proposed final judgment resolving a complaint it filed the same day to remedy potential competitive concerns regarding our acquisition of the 21CF RSNs. Pursuant to the DOJ\u2019s proposed final judgment, we will be required to hold separate and divest the 21CF RSNs following the completion of the Acquisition if the divestiture of the 21CF RSNs is not completed prior to the completion of the Acquisition. The proposed final\njudgment is subject to the approval of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. There can be no assurance that such court approval will be granted. Although we intend to fully comply with the proposed final judgment, there can be no assurance that we will be able to negotiate such divestitures expeditiously or on favorable terms, or that governmental authorities will approve the terms of such divestitures. In the event that we are unable to divest all of the 21CF RSNs within the agreed upon time periods, the DOJ may apply for a trustee to be appointed to give effect to the divestitures, and we will be unable to object to any sale of the 21CF RSNs by the trustee on any grounds other than the trustee\u2019s malfeasance.\nAlthough we expect that the Acquisition will result in synergies and other benefits to us, we may not realize those benefits because of difficulties related to integration, the achievement of synergies, and other challenges.\nDisney and 21CF have operated and, until completion of the Acquisition, will continue to operate, independently, and there can be no assurances that our businesses can be combined in a manner that allows for the achievement of substantial benefits. If we are not able to successfully integrate 21CF\u2019s businesses with ours or pursue our direct-to-consumer strategy successfully, the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the Acquisition may not be realized fully or may take longer than expected to be realized. Further, it is possible that there could be loss of key Disney or 21CF employees, loss of customers, disruption of either company\u2019s or both companies\u2019 ongoing businesses or unexpected issues, higher than expected costs and an overall post-completion process that takes longer than originally anticipated. Specifically, the following issues, among others, must be addressed in combining the operations of 21CF with ours in order to realize the anticipated benefits of the Acquisition so the combined company performs as the parties hope:\n\u2022\ncombining the companies\u2019 corporate functions;\n\u2022\ncombining the businesses of Disney and 21CF in a manner that permits us to achieve the synergies anticipated to result from the Acquisition, the failure of which would result in the anticipated benefits of the Acquisition not being realized in the time frame currently anticipated or at all;\n\u2022\nmaintaining existing agreements with customers, distributors, providers, talent and vendors and avoiding delays in entering into new agreements with prospective customers, distributors, providers, talent and vendors;\n\u2022\ndetermining whether and how to address possible differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies;\n\u2022\nintegrating the companies\u2019 administrative and information technology infrastructure;\n\u2022\ndeveloping products and technology that allow value to be unlocked in the future; and\n\u2022\neffecting potential actions that may be required in connection with obtaining regulatory approvals.\nIn addition, at times the attention of certain members of our management and resources may be focused on completion of the Acquisition and integration planning of the businesses of the two companies and diverted from day-to-day business operations, which may disrupt our ongoing business and the business of the combined company.\nConsummation of the Acquisition will increase our exposure to the risks of operating internationally.\nWe are a diversified entertainment company that offers entertainment, travel and consumer products worldwide. Although many of our businesses increasingly depend on acceptance of our offerings and products by consumers outside of the U.S., the combination with 21CF will increase the importance of international operations to our future operations, growth and prospects. The risks of operating internationally that we already face may therefore increase upon completion of the Acquisition.\nOur consolidated indebtedness will increase substantially following completion of the Acquisition. This increased level of indebtedness could adversely affect us, including by decreasing our business flexibility.\nOur consolidated indebtedness as of September 29, 2018 was approximately $20.9 billion. Upon completion of the Acquisition, we will assume an estimated $19 billion of additional outstanding debt of 21CF. In addition, we have obtained a bridge commitment of up to $35.7 billion and may draw on such facility or other bridge facilities, issue additional commercial paper, or obtain other debt financing in order to finance a portion of the cash consideration for the Acquisition. We expect to use a portion of 21CF\u2019s cash to repay a portion of the increased indebtedness promptly after completion of the Acquisition, and use proceeds from the sale of the 21CF RSNs (as defined below) to repay additional indebtedness when those proceeds become available. Following the completion of these transactions, we expect that the combined company will have approximately $40 billion of short and long-term debt and interest expense of approximately $2 billion per year.\nThe increased indebtedness could have the effect of, among other things, reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions. In addition, the amount of cash required to pay interest on our increased indebtedness levels will increase following completion of the Acquisition, and thus the demands on our cash resources will be greater than prior to the Acquisition. The increased levels of indebtedness following completion of the Acquisition could also reduce funds available for capital expenditures, share repurchases and dividends, and other activities and may create competitive disadvantages for us relative to other companies with lower debt levels. Our financial flexibility may be further constrained by the issuance of shares of common stock in the Acquisition, because of dividend payments.", "PERMNO": 87436, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "DIG.3"}
