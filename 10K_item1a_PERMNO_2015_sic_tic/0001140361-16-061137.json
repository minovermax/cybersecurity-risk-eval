{"cik": "1052257", "company": "Agritech Worldwide, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-04-14", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nInvesting in our common stock and securities involves a high degree of risk. In addition to the risks related to our business set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the other information included and incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, you should carefully consider the risks described below before purchasing our common stock or other securities. Additional risks, uncertainties and other factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nWe have a history of operating losses and cannot guarantee profitable operations in the future. Failure on our part to achieve profitability may cause us to reduce or eventually cease operations.\nWe incurred a net loss of $23,976,431 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, and had an accumulated deficit of $156,429,630. We incurred a net loss of $5,579,708 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014.\nIf we continue to incur significant losses, we may not be able to continue operations. Even if we can continue operations, our cash reserves may be depleted earlier than currently anticipated, and we may be required to limit its future growth objectives to levels corresponding with its then available cash reserves.\nDue to our history of losses, our accountants have raised substantial doubt with respect to our ability to continue as a going concern.\nAlthough we have generated revenue, we are still operating at a significant net loss, and may continue to incur significant losses for a period of time. We will be required to obtain additional financing in order to repay existing contractual obligations coming due in 2016, and to continue to cover operating losses and working capital needs. We cannot assure you that our revenue generated from operations or any future funds we raise will be sufficient to support our continued operations.\nThe audit report of M&K CPAS, PLLC for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 contained a paragraph that emphasizes the substantial doubt as to our continuance as a going concern. This is a significant risk that we may not be able to generate or raise enough capital to remain operational for an indefinite period of time.\nIf we do not obtain additional financing, we will be required to discontinue operations.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had cash in the amount of $309,851 and total liabilities in the amount of $4,918,652. We also had a working capital deficit of $3,801,651 as of December 31, 2015. Over the last several years, our operations have been funded primarily through the sale of both equity and debt securities. However, we still require additional financing to fully implement our business plan for the next twelve months and beyond. Our current cash on hand is insufficient for us to be able to maintain its operations at the current level through June 30, 2016. In order to continue to pursue our business plan, we will require additional funding. If we are not able to secure additional funding, the implementation of our business plan will be delayed and its ability to maintain or expand operations will be impaired. We intend to secure additional funding through debt or equity financing arrangements, increased sales generated by operations and reduced expenses.\nOur ability to repay our loans is predicated on future sales growth and generating positive cash flow from the business or securing other financing.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had total liabilities of $4,918,652, which includes $1,831,866 of short term notes. The amount of revenues generated by the business has been insufficient to support ongoing daily operations. Previously, we had to rely on new equity or debt financing in order to satisfy other financing incurred by us. Our current cash balance as of April 11, 2016 of $610,209 will not be sufficient to repay the loans and support our continuing operations as planned. There are no assurances that we will secure additional debt or equity financing in order to pay off the loans and support our continuing operations as planned.\nOur success is dependent on market acceptance of our products. We make no projections regarding the viability of our functional food ingredients and we cannot assure you that we will achieve any particular results.\nWe have not conducted, nor have others made available to us, results of market research indicating how much market demand exists for Z Trim, our functional food ingredient. We are relying on the current concerns over obesity, weight-health issues, and the rising cost of both foods and health care to drive demand for line of products offered to the food and nutritional beverage industry. We have only recently begun exploring the use of our products for non-food usage (such as industrial products) and are also unable to determine whether there will be a viable non-food market going forward. We cannot assure you that we will be able to gain the market acceptance necessary to achieve profitability or that a significant market will exist for our products.\nWe make no projection with respect to our future income, assets or business. No expert has reviewed our business plan for accuracy or reasonableness. It is likely that our actual business and results of operations will differ from those presented herein.\nWe derive a significant portion of our current revenues and order bookings from a small number of customers.\nOur revenues and order bookings are concentrated with a small number of customers. There were three significant customers who accounted for 45%, 10% and 6%, respectively, of total sales for the year ended December 31, 2015. There were three significant customers who accounted for 28%, 26% and 6%, respectively, of total sales for the year ended December 31, 2014. The loss of one or more of our customers or material changes to the contracts with or payment terms of these customers may result in a significant business interruption through reduced revenues, reduced cash flows, delays in revenues or cash flows and such delays or reductions could have a material adverse impact on our future revenue growth and results of operations, as well as our ability to continue operations.\nOur manufacturing facility is currently operating at a loss and at this time we do not have any commitments for manufacturing at another location.\nOur manufacturing facility was intended to be a pilot plant. In order to fully implement our business plans we will need to successfully ramp up production at a second facility, move the operations to larger facilities, develop strategic partnerships or find other means to produce greater volumes of finished product, and we cannot assure that we will be able to do so or to achieve positive gross margins and profitable operations.\nIn 2012 we launched a new industrial products division in which we had no prior experience.\nThe industrial products division focuses on the manufacture, marketing and sale of products designed for industrial applications, such as oil drilling fluids, petroleum coke, charcoal briquettes, hydraulic fracturing, and paper and wood adhesives. Prior to its launch in 2012 we had no prior experience in the manufacturing, marketing or sale of industrial products. To date we have had limited sales of products by this division. We may not be successful in these activities and may never generate significant revenues or profitability from our industrial products division.\nThe availability and cost of agricultural products that we use in our business are subject to weather and other factors beyond our control.\nAll of our current products depend on our proprietary technology using agricultural products, mainly corn bran and oat hull. Historically, the costs of corn bran and oat hull are subject to fluctuations depending upon a number of factors which affect commodity prices in general and over which we have no control, including crop conditions, weather, government programs and purchases by foreign governments. Commodity price changes may result in unexpected increases in raw material, packaging, and energy costs. We currently do not hedge against changes in commodity prices. If we are unable to increase productivity to offset these increased costs or increase our prices, we may experience reduced margins and profitability.\nSince we are totally dependent on our current manufacturing facility; any operational disruption would result in a reduction of our sales volumes and could cause us to incur additional substantial losses.\nOur revenues primarily are derived from the sale of functional ingredients made from dietary fiber that we manufacture at our pilot plant. Our operations may be subject to significant interruption if our facility experiences a major accident or is damaged by severe weather or other natural disasters. In addition, our operation may be subject to labor disruptions and unscheduled downtime, or other operational hazards inherent in the industry, such as equipment failures, fires, explosions, abnormal pressures, blowouts, pipeline ruptures, transportation accidents and natural disasters. Some of these operational hazards may cause personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment or environmental damage, and may result in suspension of operations and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. Our insurance may not be adequate to fully cover the potential operational hazards described above; in addition, we may not be able to renew this insurance on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nIf competition increases, our ability to attract and retain customers or expand our business could be impaired.\nCompetition is intense in our targeted industries, including nutraceuticals, functional food ingredients, oils, and gums. A large number of businesses are engaged in various fat replacement industries. Many of our competitors have established reputations for successfully developing and marketing their products, including products that are widely recognized as providing similar calorie reduction. In addition, many of our competitors have greater financial, managerial, and technical resources than we have. If we are not successful in competing in these markets, we may not be able to attain our business objectives or continue operations.\nOur intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products, services and brand.\nOur patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights and other intellectual property rights are important assets for us. Various events outside of our control pose a threat to our intellectual property rights as well as to our products and services. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are distributed. Also, the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business or our ability to compete. Also, protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming. Any increase in the unauthorized use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our operating results.\nAdditionally, there can be no assurance that competitors will not develop, patent or gain access to similar know-how and technology, or reverse engineer our products, or that any confidentiality agreements upon which we rely to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information will be adequate to protect our proprietary technology. The occurrence of any such events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur inability to secure and protect our intellectual property may result in costly and time-consuming litigation and could impede us from ever attaining market success.\nAlthough we seek to obtain patent protection for our innovations, it is possible we may not be able to protect some of these innovations. In addition, given the costs of obtaining patent protection, we may choose not to protect certain innovations that later turn out to be important. Furthermore, there is always the possibility, despite our efforts, that the scope of the protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or unenforceable.\nConfidentiality agreements with employees and others may not adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information and may not adequately protect our intellectual property.\nWe rely on the legal protections of trade secrets to protect our technology, especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. In order to protect our proprietary technology and processes, we also rely in part on confidentiality and intellectual property assignment agreements with our corporate partners, employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators and sponsored researchers and other advisors. These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information nor result in the effective assignment to us of intellectual property, and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or other breaches of the agreements. In addition, others may independently discover our trade secrets and proprietary information, and in such case we could not assert any trade secret rights against such party. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets is difficult, expensive and time consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the United States may be less willing to protect trade secrets. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to seek to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights, and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position.\nOur competitors may design products around our intellectual property protection.\nWe hold an intellectual property portfolio, including patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection. Our competitors, however, may design around our patent claims, rendering our patent protection ineffective against such competitors. Similarly, our competitors may independently develop technology similar to our trade secrets and technical know-how. Such occurrences could increase competitive pressure on our marketing and sales efforts, and adversely affect our results of operation.\nWe may not be successful in avoiding claims that we infringe others\u2019 proprietary rights and could be required to pay judgments or licensing fees.\nAny claim that we infringe a third party\u2019s patents or other intellectual property rights, whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming and result in costly litigation. If any of our practices are found to be in violation of another party\u2019s rights, we may be required to pay monetary damages or licensing fees, which could be substantial, or cease making products which are deemed to be infringing. Any of those occurrences could substantially harm our business, results and financial condition.\nIf our food products become adulterated, misbranded, or mislabeled, we might need to recall those items and may experience product liability claims if consumers are injured.\nWe may need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated, misbranded, or mislabeled. A widespread product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall, the destruction of product inventory, and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time. In such a case, or in the event that injuries are determined to arise from our products, we could also suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against us. A significant product recall or product liability case could also result in adverse publicity, damage to our reputation, and a loss of consumer confidence in our food products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business results and the value of our brands.\nIf we fail to comply with government regulation impacting our business, we may be subject to a range of sanctions that will adversely impact our operations.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, and compliance with existing or future laws and regulations may require us to incur substantial expenditures or require us to make product recalls. As such, we are subject to a broad range of federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations intended to protect public health and the environment. Food production and marketing are highly regulated by a variety of federal, state, local, and foreign agencies. Changes in laws or regulations that impose additional or different regulatory requirements on us could increase our cost of doing business or restrict our actions, causing our results of operations to be adversely affected. In addition, we advertise our products. Our advertisements could be the target of claims relating to alleged false or deceptive advertising under federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations and of new laws or regulations restricting our right to advertise products.\nOur operations are also subject to regulation by various federal agencies, including the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax Trade Bureau, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Food and Drug Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency, and by various state and local authorities. Such regulation covers virtually every aspect of our operations, including production facilities, marketing, pricing, labeling, packaging, advertising, water usage, waste water discharge, disposal of hazardous wastes and omissions and other matters. Violations of any of these laws and regulations may result in administrative, civil or criminal penalties being levied against us, permit revocation or modification, performance of environmental investigatory or remedial activities, voluntary or involuntary product recalls, or a cease and desist order against operations that are not in compliance. These laws and regulations may change in the future and we may incur material costs in our efforts to comply with current or future laws and regulations or to affect any product recalls. These matters may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf our products do not satisfy governmental regulations, we may be unable to obtain regulatory approval or may be required to obtain multiple licenses to sell our products.\nWe have self-certified that all components of its products are generally recognized as safe (\u201cGRAS\u201d) according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulations. A GRAS designation exempts the products from the regulations of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, permitting the sale of the products anywhere in the United States without obtaining a license. Should the products lose their GRAS designation, we will be required to sell the products as food additives by obtaining a license to sell from each individual state in which sales would occur. There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully obtain or maintain licenses in all states in which sales are expected to be made or that the cost of obtaining and maintaining these licenses would not limit its ability to sell its products.\nWe are subject to periodic litigation and other regulatory proceedings, which could result in unexpected expense of time and resources.\nWe have been a defendant from time to time in lawsuits and regulatory actions relating to our business, including litigation brought by former employees. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings. An unfavorable outcome could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any significant litigation in the future, regardless of its merits, could divert management\u2019s attention from our operations and result in substantial legal fees.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, which could impact negatively our ability to report our results of operations and financial condition accurately and in a timely manner.\nEffective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports. We have identified material weaknesses in these controls. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In our annual evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting conducted by management as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, at December 31, 2015, we identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and concluded that, as of December 31, 2015, we did not maintain effective control over financial reporting based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. For a detailed description of these material weaknesses, see Item 9A, \u201cControls and Procedures,\u201d herein. Each of our material weaknesses results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements that we prepare will not be prevented or detected. As a result, we are required to perform additional work to obtain reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial statements.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a - 15(c) and 15d - 15(e)). Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered in this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the required time periods and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nIf we are unsuccessful in developing and implementing or following a remediation plan, or fail to update our internal control over financial reporting as our business evolves, we may not be able to timely or accurately report our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows or to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures. If we are unable to report financial information in a timely and accurate manner or to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures, we could be subject to, among other things, regulatory or enforcement actions by the SEC, securities litigation and a general loss of investor confidence, any one of which could adversely affect our business prospects and the market value of our common stock.\nFailure to attract and retain qualified personnel could lead to a loss of revenue and/or profitability.\nOur success depends, in part, on the efforts and abilities of our management team and other key employees. Their skills, experience and industry contacts significantly benefit our operations and administration. The failure to attract and retain members of our management team and other key employees could have a negative effect on our operating results. In addition, transitions of important responsibilities to new individuals inherently include the possibility of disruptions to our business and operations, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nRisks Relating to our Common Stock\nOur stock trades at low prices per share and trades on the OTC Markets Group's OTCQB electronic quotation system, which provides limited liquidity and significant volatility.\nSince our common stock is currently traded on the OTC Markets Group\u2019s OTCQB electronic quotation system (the \u201cOTCQB\u201d), investors may find it difficult to obtain accurate quotations of our common stock and may experience a lack of buyers to purchase such stock or a lack of market makers to support the stock price. Being a penny stock also could limit the liquidity of our common stock and limit the coverage of our stock by analysts. The OTCQB generally provides less liquidity than stock exchanges like NYSE or NASDAQ. Stocks trading on the OTC markets may be very thinly traded and highly volatile. Therefore, holders of our common stock may be unable to sell their shares at any price, whether or not such shares have been registered for resale. A public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers and sellers of our common shares at any given time. This presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which we have no control. Given the lower trading volume of our common shares, significant sales of our common shares, or the expectation of these sales, could cause our share price to fall.\nThere may be a limited public market for our securities; we presently fail to qualify for listing on any national securities exchanges.\nOur common stock currently does not meet all of the requirements for initial listing on a national securities exchange. Specifically, the bid price of our common stock is less than the minimum bid price required to obtain a listing. Trading in our common stock continues to be conducted in the over-the-counter market. As a result, an investor may find it difficult to dispose of or to obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of our common stock, and our common stock may be less attractive for margin loans, for investment by larger financial institutions, as consideration in possible future acquisition transactions or other purposes.\nThe fluctuation in our stock price may result in a decline in, or the loss of, the value of your investment.\nThe price of our common stock has fluctuated widely in the past, and may continue to do so. In 2015 our stock had high and low bid prices of $0.51 and $0.04, respectively. In 2014 our stock had high and low bid prices of $1.10 and $0.15, respectively. This volatility is likely to continue for the foreseeable future. Factors affecting potential volatility include:\n- differences between our actual financial and operating results and those expected by investors and analysts;\n- our cash resources and our ability to obtain additional funding;\n- announcements of private or public sales of our securities;\n- announcements by us or a competitor of business development or exhibition projects;\n- our entering into or terminating strategic business relationships;\n- changes in government regulations;\n- changes in our revenue or expense levels;\n- fluctuations in operating results and general economic and other external market factors;\n- negative reports on us by security analysts or changes in analysts' recommendation or projections;\n- short selling of our stock in the market;\n- developments and resolution of current litigation that we are a party to; and\n- announcements of new products or technologies by us or our competitors.\nThe occurrence of any of these events may cause the price of the common stock to fall. In addition, the stock market in general has recently experienced volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance or financial condition of individual companies. Any broad market or industry fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock, regardless of operating performance or prospects.\nCompanies that experience volatility in the market price of their securities often are subject to securities class action litigation. This type of litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources away from our business.\nShares eligible for future sale may adversely affect the market for our common stock.\nFrom time to time, certain of our stockholders may be eligible to sell all or some of their shares of common stock by means of ordinary brokerage transactions in the open market pursuant to Rule 144 (\u201cRule 144\u201d), promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d), subject to certain limitations. In general, pursuant to Rule 144, a stockholder (or stockholders whose shares are aggregated) who has satisfied the required holding period may, under certain circumstances, sell within any three-month period a number of securities which does not exceed the greater of 1% of the then outstanding shares of common stock. Rule 144 also permits, under certain circumstances, the sale of securities, without any limitations, by a non-affiliate of our company that has satisfied a one-year holding period. Any substantial sale of common stock pursuant to Rule 144 or pursuant to any resale prospectus may have an adverse effect on the market price, if any, of our securities.\nExercises of stock options, warrants and other convertible securities will dilute your percentage of ownership and could cause our stock price to fall.\nAs of April 14, 2016, we had outstanding stock options to purchase 11,103,275 shares of common stock and outstanding warrants to purchase 50,957,780 shares of our common stock, at prices ranging from $0.35 to $0.64 per share. Additionally, we have reserved up to a total of 40,000,000 shares (inclusive of the outstanding stock options) to be issued pursuant to equity awards under our Incentive Compensation Plan. The exercise, conversion or exchange of stock options, warrants or convertible securities will dilute the percentage ownership of our other stockholders. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock could cause the price of our common stock to fall and could impair our ability to raise capital by selling additional securities.\nWe have additional securities available for issuance, which, if issued, could adversely affect the rights of the holders of our common stock.\nPursuant to our recently adopted Articles of Incorporation, we have the authority to issue up to 500,000,000 shares of common stock and 25,000,000 shares of preferred stock. The common stock and preferred stock, as well as the awards available for issuance under the Incentive Compensation Plan, can be issued by our board of directors without stockholder approval. We will not be required to seek, and will generally not seek, stockholder approval in connection with our equity offerings. Any future issuances of such stock would further dilute the percentage ownership of us held by public stockholders. Any preferred stock that is issued may rank ahead of our common stock in terms of dividends, liquidation rights and voting rights and could adversely affect the voting power and the rights of our holders of common stock. In addition, the issuance of the preferred stock may be used as an \u201canti-takeover\u201d device without further action on the part of our stockholders, and may adversely affect the holders of the common stock.\nOur principal stockholder has the ability to exert significant influence in determining the outcome of all corporate transactions or other matters which require the approval of our stockholders and may have different interests than you.\nAristar Capital Management, LLC (\u201cAristar Capital\u201d), Aristar Ventures I, LLC (\u201cAristar I\u201d), Aristar Ventures I-B, LLC (\u201cAristar I-B\u201d), and Aristar Ventures I-C, LLC (\u201cAristar I-C\u201d), (collectively \u201cAristar Ventures\u201d), entities indirectly controlled by Edward B. Smith III, our Chief Executive Officer, beneficially own approximately 73.2% of our common stock. Edward B. Smith III, is the beneficial owner of 80.5% of our outstanding shares of common stock. As a result, Aristar has a significant influence in determining the outcome of all corporate transactions or other matters which require approve of our stockholders, including mergers, consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, the power to elect directors to the board of directors, and also the power to prevent or cause a change in control. Aristar may prevent or frustrate attempts to effect a transaction or series of transactions that is or are in our best interests or our minority stockholders. The interests of Aristar may differ from the interests of the other stockholders. In addition, this concentration of ownership may delay or prevent a change in our control, even when a change in control may be in our best interest or the other stockholders, and might affect the market price of our common stock. Furthermore, the interests of this concentration of ownership may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders.\nCertain of our officers and directors have sufficient voting power to make corporate governance decisions that could have a significant effect on us and the other stockholders.\nAs of April 14, 2016, our officers and directors together beneficially own approximately 82.7% of our outstanding common stock on a fully diluted basis. Mr. Smith alone through his direct and indirect holdings beneficially owns approximately 80.5% of our outstanding common stock on a fully diluted basis. As a result, Mr. Smith, alone will be able to exert a significant degree of influence over our management and affairs and over matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. In addition, this concentration of ownership may delay or prevent a change in our control and might affect the market price of our common stock, even when a change in control may be in the best interest of all stockholders. Furthermore, the interests of this concentration of ownership may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders. Accordingly, these stockholders could cause us to enter into transactions or agreements that we would not otherwise consider.\nOur stock price may drop unexpectedly due to short selling of our common stock in the market.\nWe have experienced and may continue to experience unexpected declines in our stock price due to manipulation of the market by individuals who profit by short selling our common stock. Short selling occurs when an individual borrows shares from an investor through a broker and then sells those borrowed shares at the current market price. The \"short seller\" profits when the stock price falls because he or she can repurchase the stock at a lower price and pay back the person from whom he or she borrowed the stock, thereby making a profit. We cannot assure you that short sellers will not drive the stock price down in the future, causing decline in the value of your investment.\nWe do not plan to pay dividends to holders of common stock.\nWe do not anticipate paying cash dividends to the holders of the common stock at any time. Accordingly, investors in our common stock must rely upon subsequent sales after price appreciation as the sole method to realize a gain on investment. There are no assurances that the price of common stock will ever appreciate in value. Investors seeking cash dividends should not buy our securities.\nBecause the SEC imposes additional sales practice requirements on brokers who deal in our shares, which are penny stocks, some brokers may be unwilling to trade them. This means that you may have difficulty in reselling your shares and may cause the price of the shares to decline.\nOur stock is a penny stock. The SEC generally defines \u201cpenny stock\u201d to be any equity security that has a market price less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. Our securities are covered by the penny stock rules, which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell to persons other than established customers and \u201caccredited investors\u201d. The term \u201caccredited investor\u201d refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 jointly with their spouse. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the SEC which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer\u2019s account. The bid and offer quotations and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer\u2019s confirmation. In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser\u2019s written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the stock that is subject to these penny stock rules. Consequently, these penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to trade our securities. We believe that the penny stock rules discourage investor interest in, and limit the marketability of, our common stock.\nIn addition to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules promulgated by the SEC, FINRA has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative, low-priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer\u2019s financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. The FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our stock.", "PERMNO": 90065, "SIC": 2090, "TIC": "FBER"}
