{"cik": "1017968", "company": "EDGEWATER TECHNOLOGY INC/DE/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-03-16", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to other information contained in this Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating Edgewater and its business because such factors could have a significant impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. These risk factors could cause actual results to materially differ from those projected in any forward-looking statements.\nRisks Relating to Our Pending Merger with Alithya\nThe pendency of the merger with Alithya could adversely affect our business and operations. In connection with the pending merger with Alithya, some of our customers or vendors may delay or defer decisions, which could negatively affect our revenues, earnings, cash flows and expenses, regardless of whether the merger is completed. Similarly, our current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company following the merger, which may materially adversely affect our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel during the pendency of the merger and which may materially adversely divert attention from the daily activities of our existing employees.\nIn addition, due to operating covenants in the Arrangement Agreement, we may be unable, during the pendency of the merger, to pursue strategic transactions, undertake significant capital projects, undertake certain significant financing transactions and otherwise pursue other actions that are not in the ordinary course of business, even if such actions would prove beneficial to us. Further, the process of seeking to accomplish the merger could also divert the focus of our management from pursuing other opportunities that could be beneficial to it, without realizing any of the benefits which might have resulted had the merger been completed.\nFailure to complete the merger with Alithya could negatively impact our future business and financial results. We cannot make any assurances that we will be able to satisfy all of the conditions to the merger or succeed in any litigation brought in connection with the merger. If the merger is not completed, the financial results of the Company may be adversely affected and we will be subject to several risks, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe requirement that we pay Alithya a termination fee of $4.0 million under certain circumstances provided in the Arrangement Agreement;\n\u2022\nthe payment of costs relating to the merger, such as legal, accounting, financial advisor and printing fees, regardless of whether the merger is completed;\n\u2022\nthe focus of our management team on the merger instead of the pursuit of other opportunities that could have been beneficial to each company; and\n\u2022\nthe potential occurrence of litigation related to any failure to complete the merger.\nIn addition, if the merger is not completed, we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and from our customers and employees. If the merger is not completed, we cannot assure you that these risks will not materialize and will not materially and adversely affect our business, financial results and stock price.\nThe Arrangement Agreement contains provisions that limit each party\u2019s ability to pursue alternatives to the merger, could discourage a potential competing acquiror from making a favorable alternative transaction proposal for us and, in specified circumstances, could require us to pay a termination fee to Alithya. The Arrangement Agreement contains \u201cnon-solicitation\u201d provisions that, subject to limited exceptions, restrict our ability to, among other things, directly or indirectly solicit, initiate, facilitate, knowingly encourage or induce or take any action that could be reasonably expected to lead to the making, submission or announcement of a proposal competing with the transactions contemplated by the Arrangement Agreement. In addition, while our board of directors has the ability, in certain circumstances, to change its recommendation of the transaction to the Company\u2019s stockholders, we cannot terminate the Arrangement Agreement to accept an alternative proposal, and Alithya generally has an opportunity to modify the terms of the merger and the Arrangement Agreement in\n- 16 -\nresponse to any alternative proposals that may be made before such board of directors may withdraw or modify its recommendation. Moreover, in certain circumstances, we may be required to pay up to $2.0 million of Alithya\u2019s expenses and we may be required to pay Alithya a termination fee of $4.0 million.\nThese provisions could discourage a potential third party that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant portion of us from considering or proposing that acquisition, even if it were prepared to pay consideration with a higher per share cash or market value than the market value proposed to be received or realized in the merger with Alithya. In addition, these provisions might result in a potential third party acquirer proposing to pay a lower price to our stockholders than it might otherwise have proposed to pay because of the added expense of the termination fee that may become payable in certain circumstances.\nIf the Arrangement Agreement is terminated and we determine to seek another business combination, we may not be able to negotiate a transaction with another party on terms comparable to, or better than, the terms of the merger with Alithya.\nThe activities of activist shareholders could be disruptive and costly and these actions could result in a change to the strategic direction of the Company. We have encountered activist shareholders from time-to-time, and the attention required to address activist shareholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations and divert the attention of management and our employees from executing our strategic plan. Perceived uncertainties as to our future direction as a result of changes to composition of the Board of Directors may lead to the perception of a change in the direction of the business, instability or lack of continuity which may be exploited by our competitors, cause concern to our current or potential clients, and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel.\nBecause we rely on highly-trained and experienced personnel to design and build complex systems for our customers, an inability to retain existing employees and attract new qualified employees would impair our ability to provide our services to existing and new customers. Our future success depends in large part on our ability to attract new qualified employees and retain existing highly-trained and experienced technical consultants, project management consultants, business analysts and sales and marketing professionals of various experience levels. If we fail to attract new employees or retain our existing employees, we may be unable to complete existing projects or bid for new projects of similar size, which could adversely affect our revenues. While attracting and retaining experienced employees is critical to our business and growth strategy, maintaining our current employee base may also be particularly difficult. Even if we are able to grow and expand our employee base, the additional resources required to attract new employees and retain existing employees may adversely affect our operating margins.\nThe appointment of an interim CEO could adversely affect our business. The Board of Directors has appointed an interim CEO and this may create risks and uncertainties around the Company\u2019s strategic direction. Perceived uncertainties as to our future direction may be exploited by our competitors, cause concern to our current or potential clients, and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel. In addition, it may take time for the interim CEO to gain a full understanding of the Company\u2019s business, operations, clients and employees, which, in turn, may adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial results, particularly in the short term.\nOur business could be adversely affected by a significant or prolonged economic downturn. Our results of operations are affected by the level of business activity of our customers, which in turn is affected by the level of economic activity in the industries and markets that they serve. A decline in the level of business activity of our customers has had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profit margin. Future economic conditions could cause some customers to reduce or defer their expenditures for consulting services. We have implemented and will continue to implement cost-savings initiatives to manage our expenses as a percentage of revenue. However, current and future cost-management initiatives may not be sufficient to avoid reductions in our margins if the economic environment should weaken for a prolonged period.\n- 17 -\nThe increased emphasis on a cloud strategy may give rise to risks that could harm our business. Our cloud strategy requires continued investment in product development and cloud operations and could alter the way in which we price and deliver our products and services. Further, the additional focus on the decisions of cloud versus \u201con premise\u201d solutions by our customers could lead to project start delays.\nOur lack of long-term customer contracts reduces the predictability of our revenues because our current contracts may be canceled on short notice and without penalty. Our customers generally retain us on a project-by-project basis, rather than under long-term contracts. As a result, a customer may not engage us for further services once a project is complete. If a significant customer or a number of customers terminate, significantly reduce, or modify their contracts with us, our results of operations would be materially and adversely affected. Consequently, future revenue should not be predicted or anticipated based on the number of customers we have or the number and size of our existing projects. If a customer were to postpone, modify or cancel a project, we would be required to shift our consultants to other projects to minimize the impact on our operating results. We cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in efficiently and effectively shifting our consultants to new projects in the event of project terminations, which could result in reduced service revenue and lower gross margins. If we experience unexpected changes or variability in our revenue, we could experience variations in our quarterly operating results and our actual results may differ materially from the amounts planned and our operating profitability may be reduced or eliminated.\nWe have significant fixed operating costs, which may be difficult to adjust in response to unanticipated fluctuations in revenue. A high percentage of our operating expenses, particularly salary expense, rent, depreciation expense and amortization of intangible assets, is fixed in advance of any particular quarter. As a result, an unanticipated decrease in the number or average size of, or unanticipated delay in the scheduling for, our projects may cause significant variations in operating results in any particular quarter and could have a material adverse effect on operations for that quarter. An unanticipated termination or decrease in size or scope of a significant project, a customer\u2019s decision not to proceed with a project we anticipated or the completion during the quarter of several significant customer projects could require us to maintain underutilized employees and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to satisfy our customers\u2019 expectations, our existing and continuing business could be adversely affected. Our sales and marketing strategy emphasizes our belief that we have highly referenceable accounts. Therefore, if we fail to satisfy the expectations of our customers, we could damage our reputation and our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers. In addition, if we fail to deliver and perform on our engagements, we could be liable to our customers for breach of contract. Although most of our contracts limit the amount of any damages to the fees we receive, we could still incur substantial cost, negative publicity and diversion of management resources to defend a claim, and as a result, our business results could suffer.\nWe may have lower margins, or lose money, on fixed-price contracts. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, fixed-price contracts represented approximately 9.4%, 10.5% and 13.0%, respectively, of our total service revenue. We assume greater financial risk on fixed-price contracts than on time-and-materials or retainer-based engagements, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully price our larger fixed-price contracts. If we fail to accurately estimate the resources and time required for an engagement, fail to manage customer expectations effectively or fail to complete fixed-price engagements within planned budgets, on time and to our customers\u2019 satisfaction, we could be exposed to cost overruns, potentially leading to lower gross profit margins or even losses on these engagements.\nCompetition in the IT and management consulting services market is intense and, therefore, we may lose projects to, or face pricing pressure from, our competitors or prospective customers\u2019 internal IT departments or international outsourcing firms. The market for IT and management consulting providers is highly competitive. In many cases, we compete for specialty IT services work with in-house technical staff, software product companies with extended service organizations and other international IT and management consulting firms, including offshore outsourcing firms. In addition, there are many small, boutique technology management\n- 18 -\nconsulting firms who have developed services similar to those offered by us. We believe that competition will continue to be strong and may increase in the future, especially if our competitors continue to reduce their price for IT and management consulting services. Such pricing pressure could have a material impact on our revenues and margins and limit our ability to provide competitive services.\nOur target market is rapidly evolving and is subject to continuous technological change. As a result, our competitors may be better positioned to address these developments or may react more favorably to these changes, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We compete on the basis of a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. Existing or future competitors may develop or offer IT and management consulting services that provide significant technological, creative, performance, price or other advantages over the services we offer.\nSome of our competitors have longer operating histories and significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and managerial resources than we do. There are relatively low barriers of entry into our business. We currently have no patented or other proprietary technology that would preclude or inhibit competitors from entering the IT services market. Therefore, we must rely on the skill of our personnel and the quality of our customer service. The costs to start an IT and management consulting services firm are low. We expect that we will continue to face additional competition from new entrants into the market in the future, offshore providers and larger integrators and we are subject to the risk that our employees may leave us and may start competing businesses. Any one or more of these factors could have a material impact on our business.\nOur results can be subject to variability as work is completed for a limited number of significant customers, and our results of operations and financial condition could be negatively affected by the loss of a major customer or significant project or the failure to collect a large account receivable. We have in the past derived, and may in the future derive, a significant portion of our service revenue from a limited number of customers. From year-to-year, revenue from one or more of our customers may exceed 10% of our total service revenue. The loss of a major customer or large project could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. In 2017 and 2016, our top five customers represented 13.9% and 15.2% of our 2017 and 2016 service revenues, respectively. The future receipt of significant commitments from new or existing customers could create future risks such as those described above concerning customer concentration.\nWe perform varying amounts of work for specific customers from year-to-year. A major customer in one year may not use our services in another year. In addition, we may derive revenue from a major customer that constitutes a large portion of a particular quarter\u2019s total revenue. If we lose any major customers or any of our customers cancel or significantly reduce a large project\u2019s scope, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. Further, if we fail to collect a large accounts receivable balance, we could be subjected to a material adverse impact on financial results and a decrease in cash flow.\nOur business could be adversely affected by local political, social, legal, tax, regulatory or environmental requirements. The local business risks in different cities, states and countries in which we or our current or potential customers operate could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. We sell our classic consulting and product-based consulting services in different cities, states and countries and may increasingly become exposed to changing political, social, legal, tax, regulatory and environmental requirements at the local, national or international level. Also, new policies or measures by governments, whether fiscal, tax, regulatory, environmental or other competitive changes, may lead to an increase in additional or unplanned expenditures, discourage our customers or potential customers from purchasing our services and ultimately adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nIf customers view offshore development as a viable alternative to our service offerings, our pricing, revenue, margins and profitability may be negatively affected. In recent years, international IT service firms have been founded in countries such as India and China, which have well-educated and technically-trained\n- 19 -\nworkforces available at wage rates that are substantially lower than U.S. wage rates. While traditionally we have not competed with offshore development, the offshore model has matured and offers an alternative choice when companies evaluate their IT consulting needs. To counteract the alternative of going offshore for IT consulting services, we are focusing on advisory and product-based service offerings, including design and strategy consulting engagements, which are more difficult for offshore development firms to replicate. If we are unable to continually evolve our service offerings or the rate of acceptance of offshore development advances beyond current levels, then our pricing and revenue could be adversely affected.\nWe depend on our key personnel, and the loss of their services may adversely affect our business. We believe that our success depends on the continued employment of the senior management team and other key personnel. This dependence is particularly important to our business because personal relationships are a critical element in obtaining and maintaining customer engagements. If one or more members of the senior management team or other key personnel were unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions, our business could be seriously harmed. Furthermore, other companies seeking to develop in-house business capabilities may hire away some of our key personnel.\nOur business could be adversely affected by material changes to our strategic relationship with Oracle America, Inc. Our EPM-related service offering derives a substantial portion of its revenues from a channel relationship with Oracle. This relationship involves Oracle assisted lead generation support with respect to the business intelligence services provided in connection with our EPM-related service offerings. This relationship is governed by an Oracle Partner Network Agreement, which is subject to annual renewal. A failure to renew this relationship, or a material modification or change in Oracle\u2019s partner approach or its contract terms, for any reason, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nOur business could be adversely affected by material changes to our strategic relationship with Microsoft Corporation. Our ERP- and CRM-related product and service offerings derive a substantial portion of revenues from a channel relationship with Microsoft. This relationship involves Microsoft-assisted lead generation support with respect to the services provided by Fullscope. This relationship is governed by a Microsoft Partner Agreement, which is subject to annual renewal. A failure to renew this relationship, or a material modification or change in Microsoft\u2019s partner approach or its contract terms, for any reason, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nPast or future business combination transactions or other strategic alternatives could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees, increase our expenses and adversely affect our business. We have, in the past, realized growth, in part, through acquisitions, and we anticipate that a portion of our future growth may be accomplished through one or more business combination transactions or other strategic alternatives. The ultimate success of any such transactions will depend upon, among other things, our ability to integrate acquired personnel, operations, products and technologies into our organization effectively, to retain and motivate key personnel of acquired businesses and to retain customers of acquired businesses. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in this regard or that we will be able to identify suitable opportunities, successfully grow acquired businesses, integrate acquired personnel and operations successfully or utilize our cash or equity securities as acquisition currency on acceptable terms to complete any such business combination transactions. These difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees, increase our expenses and materially and adversely affect our results of operations. Any such transactions would involve certain other risks, including the reduction of cash and/or working capital, the assumption of additional liabilities, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities and diversion of management\u2019s attention from operating activities.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights or we may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others, which could adversely affect our business. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our intellectual property rights and our ability to protect these rights. We do not have any patents or patent applications pending. Existing trade secret and copyright laws afford us only limited protection. Third parties\n- 20 -\nmay attempt to disclose, obtain or use our solutions or technologies. This is particularly true in foreign countries where laws or law enforcement practices may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States. Others may independently develop and obtain patents or copyrights for technologies that are similar or superior to our technologies. If that happens, we may need to license these technologies and we may not be able to obtain licenses on reasonable terms, if at all. If we are unsuccessful in any future intellectual property litigation, we may be forced to do one or more of the following:\n\u25fe\nCease selling or using technology or services that incorporate the challenged intellectual property;\n\u25fe\nObtain a license, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all, to use the relevant technology;\n\u25fe\nConfigure services to avoid infringement; and\n\u25fe\nRefund license fees or other payments that we have previously received.\nGenerally, we develop software applications for specific customer engagements. Issues relating to ownership of and rights to use software applications and frameworks can be complicated. Also, we may have to pay economic damages in these disputes, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nFluctuations in our quarterly revenues and operating results may lead to increased volatility of our stock. Our quarterly revenues and operating results can sometimes be volatile. We believe comparisons of prior period operating results cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance. If our revenues or our operating results in any future period fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, the market price of our securities would likely decline.\nFactors that may cause our quarterly results to fluctuate in the future include the following:\n\u25fe\nVariability in market demand for IT and management consulting services;\n\u25fe\nGeneral economic or stock market conditions unrelated to our operating performance;\n\u25fe\nLength of the sales cycle associated with our service offerings;\n\u25fe\nProduct launch delays;\n\u25fe\nUnanticipated variations in the size, budget, number or progress toward completion of our engagements;\n\u25fe Unanticipated termination of a major engagement, a customer\u2019s decision not to proceed with an engagement we anticipated or the completion or delay during a quarter of several major customer engagements;\n\u25fe Efficiency with which we utilize our employees, or utilization, including our ability to transition employees from completed engagements to new engagements;\n\u25fe Our ability to manage our operating costs, a large portion of which are fixed in advance of any particular quarter;\n\u25fe Changes in pricing policies by us or our competitors;\n\u25fe Seasonality and cyclicality, including the effects of lower utilization rates during periods with disproportionately high holiday and vacation usage experience;\n\u25fe The timing of customer year-end periods and the impact of spending relative to such year-end periods;\n\u25fe Our ability to manage future growth; and\n\u25fe Costs of attracting, retaining and training skilled personnel.\nSome of these factors are within our control, while others are outside of our control.\nVolatility of our stock price could result in expensive class action litigation. If our common stock suffers from volatility like the securities of other technology and consulting companies, we could be subject to securities class action litigation similar to that which has been brought against other companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their common stock. The process of defending against these types of claims, regardless of their merit, is costly and often creates a considerable distraction to senior management. Any future\n- 21 -\nlitigation could result in substantial additional costs and could divert our resources and senior management\u2019s attention. This could harm our productivity and profitability and potentially adversely affect our stock price.\nWe may be required to record additional impairment charges against the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets in future quarters. As of December 31, 2017, we had recorded goodwill and intangible assets with a net book value of $35.6 million. We test for impairment at least annually and whenever evidence of impairment exists. We have in the past recorded impairment charges against the carrying value of our goodwill and intangible assets. The carrying value of our goodwill and intangible asset values are measured using a variety of factors, including values of comparable companies, overall stock market and economic data and our own projections of future financial performance. We may be required in the future to record additional impairment charges that could have a material adverse effect on our reported results.\nOur operating results could be adversely affected by fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies. As a result of our acquisitions and the international expansion of our EPM-related business, a portion of our revenues and operating expenses are, and will be, denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, these revenues and operating expenses are affected by fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates. An increase in the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies in which we have revenues will cause our revenues to be lower than with a stable exchange rate. Changes in exchange rates between other foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar can affect the recorded levels of our assets, liabilities and expenses relating to our operations. The primary foreign currencies in which we have exchange rate fluctuation exposure are the Canadian dollar, the euro, the British pound and the South African rand. Exchange rates between these currencies and U.S. dollars have fluctuated significantly in recent years, particularly as the current global financial crisis has unfolded, and may continue to do so in the future. We cannot predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our operating results.", "PERMNO": 83965, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "EDGW"}
