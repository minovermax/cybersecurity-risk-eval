{"cik": "1121484", "company": "OIL STATES INTERNATIONAL, INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-02-17", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or future results.\nDemand for most of our products and services is substantially dependent on the levels of expenditures by companies in the oil and natural gas industry. Low oil and natural gas prices have significantly reduced the demand for our products and services and the prices we are able to charge. This has had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nDemand for most of our products and services depends substantially on the level of expenditures by companies in the oil and natural gas industry. The significant decline in oil and natural gas prices during 2015 that continued in 2016 caused a reduction in most of our customers\u2019 drilling, completion and other production activities and related spending on our products and services in 2015 and 2016. The reduction in demand from our customers has resulted in an oversupply of many of the services and products we provide, and such oversupply has substantially reduced the prices we can charge our customers for many of our services, particularly customers of our Well Site Services segment. Although oil and natural gas prices improved somewhat in late 2016, these price improvements have not resulted in widespread improvements in the demand for our products and services or the prices we are able to charge. If oil and natural gas prices remain depressed or decline, our customers\u2019 activity levels and spending, and reductions in the prices we charge, could continue and accelerate through 2017 and beyond. In addition, a continuation or worsening of these conditions may result in a material adverse impact on certain of our customers\u2019 liquidity and financial position resulting in further spending reductions, delays in the collection of amounts owing to us and similar impacts. These conditions have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and it is difficult to predict how long the current depressed commodity price environment will continue.\nConditions in our industry are beginning to improve, particularly in the shale resource plays in the United States, and must continue to improve or we could encounter difficulties such as an inability to access needed capital on attractive terms or at all, the incurrence of asset impairment charges, an inability to meet financial ratios contained in our debt agreements, a need to reduce our capital spending and other similar impacts. For example, under our Credit Agreement, we must maintain an interest coverage ratio, defined as the ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense of at least 3.0 to 1.0 and a maximum leverage ratio, defined as the ratio of total debt to consolidated EBITDA, of no greater than 3.25 to 1.0. As of December 31, 2016, we had $42.2 million in borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement and $30.7 million of outstanding letters of credit, leaving $153.1 million available to be drawn under our revolving credit facility. The total amount available to be drawn under our revolving credit facility was less than the lender commitments as of December 31, 2016, due to the maximum leverage ratio covenant in our revolving credit facility which serves to limit borrowings, and such availability is expected to be further reduced during 2017 and potentially beyond, due to reductions in our trailing twelve-month EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement). As more fully disclosed in Note 10, Long-term Debt, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the heading \u201cLiquidity, Capital Resources and Other Matters,\u201d we discuss our expectations regarding liquidity and covenant compliance for 2017.\n- 13 -\nMany factors affect the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas and, therefore, influence product prices, including:\n\u25cf\nthe level of drilling activity;\n\u25cf\nthe level of oil and natural gas production;\n\u25cf\nthe levels of oil and natural gas inventories;\n\u25cf\ndepletion rates;\n\u25cf\nworldwide demand for oil and natural gas;\n\u25cf\nthe expected cost of finding, developing and producing new reserves;\n\u25cf\ndelays in major offshore and onshore oil and natural gas field development timetables;\n\u25cf\nthe availability of attractive oil and natural gas field prospects, which may be affected by governmental actions or environmental activists which may restrict development;\n\u25cf\nthe availability of transportation infrastructure for oil and natural gas, refining capacity and shifts in end-customer preferences toward fuel efficiency and the use of natural gas;\n\u25cf\nglobal weather conditions and natural disasters;\n\u25cf\nworldwide economic activity including growth in developing countries;\n\u25cf\nnational government political requirements, including the ability and willingness of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (\u201cOPEC\u201d) to set and maintain production levels and prices for oil and government policies which could nationalize or expropriate oil and natural gas exploration, production, refining or transportation assets;\n\u25cf\nshareholder activism or activities by non-governmental organizations to restrict the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas;\n\u25cf\nthe impact of armed hostilities involving one or more oil producing nations;\n\u25cf\nrapid technological change and the timing and extent of development of energy sources, including liquefied natural gas (\u201cLNG\u201d) or alternative fuels;\n\u25cf\nenvironmental and other governmental laws and regulations; and\n\u25cf\ndomestic and foreign tax policies.\nThe recent oversupply of oil and natural gas relative to demand resulted in significantly lower oil and natural gas prices beginning in the second half of 2014 which continued in 2016. As a result, many of our customers announced reductions or delays in their capital spending in 2015 and 2016, which reduced the demand for our products and services and exerted downward pressure on the prices of our products and services. Although some of our customers have increased their 2017 capital expenditure budgets, these customers are still spending significantly less than pre-2015 levels. Additionally, if oil and natural gas prices decline, these customers may further reduce their spending levels. We expect that we will continue to encounter weakness in the demand for, and prices of, our products and services until commodity prices and our customers\u2019 capital spending materially increases. Any prolonged reduction in the overall level of exploration and production activities, whether resulting from changes in oil and natural gas prices or otherwise, could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in many ways including by negatively affecting:\n\u25cf\nour equipment utilization, revenues, cash flows and profitability;\n\u25cf\nour ability to obtain additional capital to finance our business and the cost of that capital; and\n\u25cf\nour ability to attract and retain skilled personnel.\n- 14 -\nGiven the cyclical nature of our business, a severe prolonged downturn could negatively affect the value of our goodwill.\nAs of December 31, 2016, goodwill represented 19% of our total assets. We have recorded goodwill because we paid more for some of our businesses that we acquired than the fair market value of the tangible and separately measurable intangible net assets of those businesses. We are required to periodically review the goodwill of our applicable reporting units (Completion Services and Offshore Products) for impairment in value and to recognize a non-cash charge against earnings causing a corresponding decrease in stockholders' equity if circumstances, some of which are beyond our control, indicate that the carrying amount will not be recoverable. It is possible that we could recognize goodwill impairment losses in the future if, among other factors:\n\u25cf\nglobal economic conditions deteriorate;\n\u25cf\nthe outlook for future profits and cash flow for any of our reporting units deteriorate further as the result of many possible factors, including, but not limited to, increased or unanticipated competition, technology becoming obsolete, further reductions in customer capital spending plans, loss of key personnel, adverse legal or regulatory judgment(s), future operating losses at a reporting unit, downward forecast revisions, or restructuring plans;\n\u25cf\ncosts of equity or debt capital increase; or\n\u25cf\nvaluations for comparable public companies or comparable acquisition valuations deteriorate.\nFederal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and natural gas wells that may reduce demand for our products and services and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAlthough we do not directly engage in hydraulic fracturing, a certain portion of our Completion Services and Offshore Products Operations support many of our oil and natural gas exploration and production customers in such activities. Hydraulic fracturing is an important and commonly used process for the completion of oil and natural gas wells in formations with low permeabilities, such as shale formations, and involves the pressurized injection of water, sand and chemicals into rock formations to stimulate production. Hydraulic fracturing is currently generally exempt from regulation under the SDWA\u2019s Underground Injection Control (\u201cUIC\u201d) program and is typically regulated in the United States by state oil and natural gas commissions or similar agencies.\nHowever, several federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process. For example, in February 2014, the EPA asserted regulatory authority pursuant to the SDWA\u2019s UIC program over hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel and issued guidance covering such activities. The EPA also issued final CAA regulations in 2012 that include New Source Performance Standards (\u201cNSPS\u201d) for completions of hydraulically fractured natural gas wells, compressors, controls, dehydrators, storage tanks, natural gas processing plants, and certain other equipment. In June 2016, the EPA published final rules establishing new emissions standards for methane and additional standards for volatile organic compounds (\u201cVOCs\u201d) from certain new, modified and reconstructed equipment and processes in the oil and natural gas source category, including production, processing, transmission and storage activities and is formally seeking additional information from oil and natural gas exploration and production operators as necessary to eventually expand these final rules to include existing equipment and processes. In addition, in June 2016, the EPA published an effluent limit guideline final rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and natural gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants and, in May 2014, published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking regarding Toxic Substances Control Act reporting of the chemical substances and mixtures used in hydraulic fracturing. Also, the federal Bureau of Land Management (\u201cBLM\u201d) published a final rule in March 2015 that established new or more stringent standards relating to hydraulic fracturing on federal and American Indian lands but, in June 2016, a Wyoming federal judge struck down this final rule, finding that the BLM lacked authority to promulgate the rule. That decision is currently being appealed by the federal government. In addition, from time to time, Congress has considered legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing in the United States and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. At the state level, some states have adopted and other states are considering adopting legal requirements that could impose new or more stringent permitting, public disclosure or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities, including states where we or our customers operate. States could also elect to prohibit high volume hydraulic fracturing altogether, following the approach taken by the State of New York in 2015. Additionally, local governments may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place or manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular.\nIn December 2016, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources. The final report concluded that \u201cwater cycle\u201d activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources \u201cunder some circumstances,\u201d noting that the following hydraulic fracturing water cycle activities and local- or regional-scale factors are more likely than others to result in more frequent or more severe impacts: water withdrawals for fracturing in times or areas of low water availability; surface spills during the management of fracturing fluids, chemicals or produced water; injection of fracturing fluids into wells with inadequate mechanical integrity; injection of fracturing fluids directly into groundwater resources; discharge of inadequately treated fracturing wastewater to surface waters; and disposal or storage of fracturing wastewater in unlined pits. In the event that new or more stringent federal, state or local legal restrictions relating to use of the hydraulic fracturing process in the United States are adopted in areas where our oil and natural gas exploration and production customers operate, those customers could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with requirements relating to permitting, construction, financial assurance, monitoring, recordkeeping, and/or plugging and abandonment, as well as could experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of production or development activities, any of which could reduce demand for the products and services of each of our business segments and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n- 15 -\nFederal or state legislative and regulatory initiatives related to induced seismicity could result in operating restrictions or delays in the drilling and completion of oil and natural gas wells that may reduce demand for our products and services and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur oil and natural gas producing customers dispose of flowback water or certain other oilfield fluids gathered from oil and natural gas producing operations in accordance with permits issued by government authorities overseeing such disposal activities. While these permits are issued pursuant to existing laws and regulations, these legal requirements are subject to change based on concerns of the public or governmental authorities regarding such disposal activities. One such concern relates to recent seismic events near underground disposal wells used for the disposal by injection of flowback water or certain other oilfield fluids resulting from oil and natural gas activities. When caused by human activity, such events are called induced seismicity. Developing research suggests that the link between seismic activity and wastewater disposal may vary by region, and that only a very small fraction of the tens of thousands of injection wells have been suspected to be, or may have been, the likely cause of induced seismicity. In March 2016, the United States Geological Survey identified six states with the most significant hazards from induced seismicity, including Oklahoma, Kansas, Texas, Colorado, New Mexico, and Arkansas. In response to concerns regarding induced seismicity, regulators in some states have imposed, or are considering imposing, additional requirements in the permitting of produced water disposal wells or otherwise to assess any relationship between seismicity and the use of such wells. For example, Oklahoma issued new rules for wastewater disposal wells in 2014 that imposed certain permitting and operating restrictions and reporting requirements on disposal wells in proximity to faults and also, from time to time, is developing and implementing plans directing certain wells where seismic incidents have occurred to restrict or suspend disposal well operations. The Texas Railroad Commission adopted similar rules in 2014. In addition, ongoing lawsuits allege that disposal well operations have caused damage to neighboring properties or otherwise violated state and federal rules regulating waste disposal. These developments could result in additional regulation and restrictions on the use of injection wells by our customers to dispose of flowback water and certain other oilfield fluids. Increased regulation and attention given to induced seismicity also could lead to greater opposition, including litigation, to oil and natural gas activities utilizing injection wells for waste disposal. Any one or more of these developments may result in our customers having to limit disposal well volumes, disposal rates or locations, or require our customers or third party disposal well operators that are used to dispose of customers\u2019 wastewater to shut down disposal wells, which developments could adversely affect our customers\u2019 business and result in a corresponding decrease in the need for our products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAdditional domestic and international deepwater drilling laws, regulations and other restrictions, delays in the processing and approval of drilling permits and exploration, development, oil spill-response and decommissioning plans, and other related developments may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nIn recent years, the BOEM and the BSEE have imposed more stringent permitting procedures and regulatory safety and performance requirements for new wells to be drilled in federal waters. Compliance with these more stringent regulatory requirements and with existing environmental and oil spill regulations, together with any uncertainties or inconsistencies in decisions and rulings by governmental agencies, delays in the processing and approval of drilling permits and exploration, development, oil spill-response and decommissioning plans and possible additional regulatory initiatives could result in difficult and more costly actions and adversely affect or delay new drilling and ongoing development efforts.\n- 16 -\nMoreover, new regulatory initiatives may be adopted or enforced by the BOEM or the BSEE in the future that could result in additional delays, restrictions or obligations with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and production operations conducted offshore. For example, in April 2016, BOEM published a proposed rule that would update existing air emissions requirements relating to offshore oil and natural gas activity on federal Outer Continental Shelf (\u201cOCS\u201d) waters including in the Central Gulf of Mexico. BOEM regulates these air emissions in connection with its review of exploration and development plans, and right-of-use and right-of-way applications. The proposed rule would bolster existing air emission requirements by, among other things, requiring the reporting and tracking of the emissions of all pollutants defined by the EPA to affect human health and public welfare that, depending on the results obtained, could result in subsequent rulemakings that restrict offshore air emissions. In an unrelated legal initiative, BOEM issued a Notice to Lessees and Operators (\u201cNTL\u201d) in July 2016 that imposes more stringent requirements relating to the provision of financial assurance to satisfy decommissioning obligations. Together with a recent re-assessment by BSEE in 2016 in how it determines the amount of financial assurance required, the revised BOEM-administered offshore financial assurance program that is currently being implemented is expected to result in increased amounts of financial assurance being required of operators on the OCS, which amounts may be significant. These existing rules, or any new rules, regulations, or legal initiatives could delay or disrupt our customers\u2019 operations, increase the risk of expired leases due to the time required to develop new technology, result in increased supplemental bonding and costs, and limit activities in certain areas, or cause our customers to incur penalties, fines, or shut-in production at one or more of our facilities or result in the suspension or cancellation of leases, which could reduce demand for our products and services. We may incur penalties directly from BSEE if, based on review of the facts surrounding an alleged violation upon an offshore lease, BSEE elects to hold contractors, including contractors such as us who are involved in well completion operations, potentially liable for alleged violations of law arising in the BSEE\u2019s jurisdiction area. Also, if material spill events were to occur in the future, the United States or other countries where such an event were to occur could elect to issue directives to temporarily cease drilling activities and, in any event, may from time to time issue further safety and environmental laws and regulations regarding offshore oil and natural gas exploration and development, any of which developments could have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict with any certainty the full impact of any new laws, regulations or legal initiatives on our customers\u2019 drilling operations or on the cost or availability of insurance to cover the risks associated with such operations. The matters described above, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nWe do business in international jurisdictions which exposes us to unique risks.\nA portion of our revenue is attributable to operations in foreign countries. These activities accounted for approximately 29% (13% excluding the United Kingdom and Canada) of our consolidated revenue in the year ended December 31, 2016. Risks associated with our operations in foreign areas include, but are not limited to:\n\u25cf\nexpropriation, confiscation or nationalization of assets;\n\u25cf\nrenegotiation or nullification of existing contracts;\n\u25cf\nforeign exchange limitations;\n\u25cf\nforeign currency fluctuations;\n\u25cf\nforeign taxation;\n\u25cf\nthe inability to repatriate earnings or capital in a tax efficient manner;\n\u25cf\nchanging political conditions;\n\u25cf economic or trade sanctions;\n\u25cf\nchanging foreign and domestic monetary and trade policies;\n\u25cf changes in trade activity;\n\u25cf\nsocial, political, military, and economic situations in foreign areas where we do business, and the possibilities of war, other armed conflict or terrorist attacks; and\n\u25cf\nregional economic downturns.\nAs an illustration of this risk, there is a current recessionary economic environment in Brazil which, at present, is having a negative impact on orders and future growth prospects for the Company\u2019s operations in Brazil. Sales to customers in Brazil accounted for approximately 9% of the Company\u2019s consolidated revenues in 2016 and 5% in 2015.\nAdditionally, in some jurisdictions we are subject to foreign governmental regulations favoring or requiring the awarding of contracts to local contractors, or requiring foreign contractors to employ citizens of, or purchase supplies from, a particular jurisdiction. These regulations may adversely affect our ability to compete in such jurisdictions.\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom Bribery Act 2010, generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices and impact our business. Any failure to comply with the FCPA or other anti-bribery legislation could subject us to civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We could also face fines, sanctions, and other penalties from authorities in the relevant foreign jurisdictions, including prohibition of our participating in, or curtailment of, business operations in those jurisdictions and the seizure of assets. Additionally, we may have competitors who are not subject to the same ethics-related laws and regulations which provides them with a competitive advantage over us by securing business awards, licenses, or other preferential treatment, in those jurisdictions using methods that certain ethics-related laws and regulations prohibit us from using.\nThe regulatory regimes in some foreign countries may be substantially different than those in the United States, and may be unfamiliar to U.S. investors. Violations of foreign laws could result in monetary and criminal penalties against us or our subsidiaries and could damage our reputation and, therefore, our ability to do business.\nExchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our U.S. reported results of operations and financial position.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we enter into purchase and sales commitments that are denominated in currencies that differ from the functional currency used by our operating subsidiaries. Currency exchange rate fluctuations can create volatility in our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and/or cash flows. Although we may enter into foreign exchange agreements with financial institutions in order to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, these transactions, if entered into, will not eliminate that risk entirely. To the extent that we are unable to match revenues received in foreign currencies with expenses paid in the same currency, exchange rate fluctuations could have a negative impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and/or cash flows. Additionally, because our consolidated financial results are reported in U.S. dollars, if we generate net revenues or earnings in countries whose currency is not the U.S. dollar, the translation of such amounts into U.S. dollars can result in an increase or decrease in the amount of our net revenues and earnings depending upon exchange rate movements. As a result, a material decrease in the value of these currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may have a negative impact on our reported revenues, net income, and cash flows. Any currency controls implemented by local monetary authorities in countries where we currently operate could also adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe results of the United Kingdom\u2019s referendum on withdrawal from the European Union including the subsequent exchange rate fluctuations and political and economic uncertainties may have a negative effect on global economic conditions, financial markets and our business.\nWe are a multinational company and are subject to the risks inherent in doing business in other countries, including the United Kingdom (the \u201cU.K.\u201d). In June 2016, a majority of voters in the U.K. elected to withdraw from the European Union in a national referendum (\u201cBrexit\u201d). The referendum was advisory, and the terms of any withdrawal are subject to a negotiation period that could last at least two years after the government of the U.K. formally initiates a withdrawal process. Nevertheless, Brexit has created significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the U.K. and the European Union and other countries, including with respect to the laws and regulations that will apply as the U.K. determines which European Union derived laws to replace or replicate in the event of a withdrawal. The referendum has also given rise to calls for the governments of other European Union member states to consider withdrawal. These developments, or the perception that any of these developments may occur, could potentially disrupt the markets we serve and the jurisdictions in which we operate and may cause us to lose customers, suppliers, and employees.\nThe announcement of Brexit caused significant volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations that resulted in the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies in which we conduct business. As of December 31, 2016, the exchange rate of the British pound compared to the U.S. dollar weakened by 16% compared to the exchange rate at December 31, 2015. Any further volatility may adversely affect our results of operations. Asset valuations, currency exchange rates and credit ratings may be especially subject to increased market volatility. Our accumulated other comprehensive loss, reported as a component of stockholders\u2019 equity, increased from $50.7 million at December 31, 2015 to $70.3 million at December 31, 2016 due to changes in currency exchange rates, largely the British pound. The announcement of Brexit and the withdrawal of the U.K. from the European Union may also create global economic uncertainty, which may cause our customers to closely monitor their costs and reduce their spending budgets for our products and services. The impact from Brexit on our business and operations will depend on the outcome of tariff, tax treaty, trade, regulatory and other negotiations, as well as the impact of the withdrawal on macroeconomic growth and currency volatility, which are uncertain at this time. Any of these effects of Brexit could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to environmental laws and regulations that may expose us to significant costs and liabilities.\nOur operations are significantly affected by numerous federal, state, local, tribal and foreign laws, and regulations governing the discharge of substances into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. We could be exposed to liabilities for cleanup costs, natural resource damages, and other damages under these laws and regulations, with certain of these legal requirements imposing strict liability for such damages and costs, even though our conduct was lawful at the time it occurred or the conduct resulting in such damage and costs were caused by, prior operators or other third-parties.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations are subject to change in the future, possibly resulting in more stringent legal requirements. If existing regulatory requirements or enforcement policies change, we or our oil and natural gas exploration and production customers may be required to make significant, unanticipated capital and operating expenditures. Examples of recent regulations or other regulatory initiatives include the following:\n\u2022\nGround-Level Ozone Standards. In October 2015, the EPA issued a final rule under the Clean Air Act, lowering the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ground-level ozone from 75 parts per billion to 70 parts per billion under both the primary and secondary standards to provide requisite protection of public health and welfare, respectively. The EPA is expected to make final geographical attainment designations and issue final non-attainment area requirements pursuant to this NAAQS rule by late 2017 and any designations or requirements that result in reclassification of areas or imposition of more stringent standards may make it more difficult to construct new or modified sources of air pollution in newly designated non-attainment areas. Moreover, states are expected to implement more stringent regulations, which could apply to our or our oil and natural gas exploration and production customers\u2019 operations.\n- 18 -\n\u2022\nEPA Review of Drilling Waste Classification. Drilling, fluids, produced water and most of the other wastes associated with the exploration, development and production of oil or natural gas, if properly handled, are currently exempt from regulation as hazardous waste under RCRA and instead, are regulated under RCRA\u2019s less stringent non-hazardous waste provisions. However, following the filing of a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in May 2016 by several non-governmental environmental groups against the EPA for the agency\u2019s failure to timely assess its RCRA Subtitle D criteria regulations for oil and natural gas wastes, EPA and the environmental groups entered into an agreement that was finalized in a consent decree issued by the District Court on December 28, 2016. Under the decree, the EPA is required to propose no later than March 15, 2019, a rulemaking for revision of certain Subtitle D criteria regulations pertaining to oil and natural gas wastes or sign a determination that revision of the regulations is not necessary. If EPA proposes a rulemaking for revised oil and natural gas waste regulations, the Consent Decree requires that the EPA take final action following notice and comment rulemaking no later than July 15, 2021.\n\u2022\nWaters of the United States. In May 2015, the EPA released a final rule outlining its position on federal jurisdictional reach over waters of the United States. This interpretation by the EPA may constitute an expansion of federal jurisdiction over waters of the United States. The rule was stayed nationwide by the U.S. Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in October 2015 as that appellate court and several other courts ponder lawsuits opposing implementation of the rule. Litigation surrounding this rule is on-going. Compliance with these regulations and other regulatory initiatives, or any other new environmental laws and regulations could, among other things, require us or our customers to install new or modified emission controls on equipment or processes, incur longer permitting timelines, and incur significantly increased capital expenditures and operating costs, which costs may be significant. Additionally, one or more of these developments could reduce demand for our products and services. Moreover, any failure by us to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations may result in governmental authorities taking actions against our business that could adversely impact our operations and financial condition, including the:\n\u25cf\nissuance of administrative, civil, and/or criminal penalties;\n\u25cf\ndenial or revocation of permits or other authorizations;\n\u25cf\nreduction or cessation in operations; and\n\u25cf\nperformance of site investigatory, remedial, or other corrective actions.\nAn accidental release of pollutants into the environment may cause us to incur significant costs and liabilities.\nOur business activities present risks of incurring significant environmental costs and liabilities in our business as a result of our handling of petroleum hydrocarbons, because of air emissions and waste water discharges related to our operations, and due to historical industry operations and waste disposal practices. Additionally, private parties, including the owners of properties upon which we perform services and facilities where our wastes are taken for reclamation or disposal, also may have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property or natural resource damages. Some environmental laws and regulations may impose strict liability, which means that in some situations we could be exposed to liability as a result of our conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or the conduct of, or conditions caused by, prior operators or other third parties. Remedial costs and other damages arising as a result of environmental laws and costs associated with changes in environmental laws and regulations could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition. We may not be able to recover some or any of these costs from insurance.\n- 19 -\nClimate change legislation and regulations restricting or regulating emissions of GHGs could result in increased operating and capital costs and reduced demand for our products and services.\nClimate change continues to attract considerable public and scientific attention. As a result, numerous proposals have been made and are likely to continue to be made at the international, national, regional and state levels of government to monitor and limit emissions of GHGs. These efforts have included consideration of cap-and-trade programs, carbon taxes, GHG reporting and tracking programs and regulations that directly limit GHG emissions from certain sources.\nAt the federal level, no comprehensive climate change legislation has been implemented to date. The EPA has, however, adopted rules under authority of the federal Clean Air Act that, among other things, establish Potential for Significant Deterioration (\u201cPSD\u201d) construction and Title V operating permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources that are also potential major sources of certain principal, or criteria, pollutant emissions, which reviews could require securing PSD permits at covered facilities emitting GHGs and meeting \u201cbest available control technology\u201d standards for those GHG emissions. In addition, the EPA has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from certain petroleum and natural gas system sources in the U.S., including, among others, onshore and offshore production facilities, which include certain of our producing customers\u2019 operations. In October 2015, the EPA amended and expanded the GHG reporting requirements to all segments of the oil and natural gas industry.\nFederal agencies also have begun directly regulating emissions of methane, a GHG, from oil and natural gas operations. In June 2016, the EPA published NSPS, known as Subpart Quad OOOOa, that require certain new, modified or reconstructed facilities in the oil and natural gas sector to reduce these methane gas and VOC emissions. These Subpart OOOOa standards will expand previously issued NSPS published by the EPA in 2012 and known as Subpart OOOO, by using certain equipment-specific emissions control practices. Moreover, in November 2016, the EPA issued a final Information Collection Request (\u201cICR\u201d) seeking additional information from oil and gas producing operators as necessary to expand these standards to include existing equipment and processes. Additionally, in December 2015, the United States joined the international community at the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France that requires member countries to review and \u201crepresent a progression\u201d in their intended nationally determined contributions, which set GHG emission reduction goals every five years beginning in 2020. Although this agreement does not create any binding obligations for nations to limit their GHG emissions, it does include pledges to voluntarily limit or reduce future emissions.\nThe adoption and implementation of any international, federal or state legislation or regulations that require reporting of GHGs or otherwise restrict emissions of GHGs could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions imposed on us or our customers operations, adversely impact overall drilling activity in the areas in which we operate, reduce the demand for carbon-based fuels, and reduce the demand for our products and services. Any one or more of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, demand for our services, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe Endangered Species Act and Migratory Bird Treaty Act (\u201cESA\u201d) and other restrictions intended to protect certain species of wildlife govern our and our oil and natural gas exploration and production customers\u2019 operations and additional restrictions may be imposed in the future, which constraints could have an adverse impact on our ability to expand some of our existing operations or limit our customers\u2019 ability to develop new oil and natural gas wells.\nOil and natural gas operations in our operating areas may be adversely affected by seasonal or permanent restrictions on drilling activities designed to protect various wildlife, which may limit our ability to operate in protected areas. Permanent restrictions imposed to protect endangered species could prohibit drilling in certain areas or require the implementation of expensive mitigation measures.\n- 20 -\nMoreover, as a result of one or more settlements approved by the United States federal government, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (\u201cFWS\u201d) must make determinations on the listing of numerous species as endangered or threatened under the ESA. The designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species could indirectly cause us to incur additional costs, cause our or our oil and natural gas exploration and production customers\u2019 operations to become subject to operating restrictions or bans, and limit future development activity in affected areas.\nChanges to tax laws and regulations could materially, negatively impact the Company by increasing the costs of doing business for our customers thereby decreasing the demand for our products and services.\nChanges in various laws and regulations could have a material negative effect on our customers, resulting in lower demand for our products and services. In past years, legislation has been proposed that would, if enacted into law, make significant changes to U.S. tax laws including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf\nrepeal of expensing of intangible drilling costs and exploration and development costs;\n\u25cf\nincrease of the amortization period for geological and geophysical costs to seven years;\n\u25cf\nrepeal of percentage depletion;\n\u25cf\nrepeal of the domestic manufacturing deduction for oil and natural gas production;\n\u25cf\nrepeal of the passive loss exception for working interests in oil and natural gas properties;\n\u25cf\nrepeal of the credits for enhanced oil recovery projects and production from marginal wells;\n\u25cf\nrepeal of the deduction for tertiary injectants;\n\u25cf\nchanges to the tax treatment of Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs); and\n\u25cf\nchanges to the foreign tax credit limitation calculation.\nCongress could consider, and could include, some or all of these proposals as part of tax reform legislation, to accompany lower federal income tax rates. Moreover, other more general features of tax reform legislation, including changes to cost recovery rules and to the deductibility of interest expense, may be developed that also would change the taxation of oil and gas companies. It is unclear whether these or similar changes will be enacted and, if enacted, how soon any such changes could take effect.\nIn addition, the Republican members of the House Ways and Means Committee in June 2016 released a Blueprint for a pro-growth tax code which, among other provisions, includes a destination-based business cash flow tax. This proposal includes border adjustments, under which products, services and intangibles that are exported from the United States would not be subject to U.S. tax, but products, services and intangibles that a business imports into the United States would be subject to U.S. tax. This proposal currently is under active consideration in Congress as part of the development of potential comprehensive tax reform legislation. If enacted, such proposal could serve to delay access to or increase the costs of goods and services that we import.\nWe are susceptible to seasonal earnings volatility due to adverse weather conditions in our regions of operations.\nOur operations are directly affected by seasonal differences in weather in the areas in which we operate, most notably in the Rocky Mountain region of the United States, the Gulf of Mexico and Canada. Severe winter weather conditions in the Rocky Mountain region of the United States can restrict access to work areas for our Well Site Services segment customers. Our operations in and near the Gulf of Mexico are also affected by weather patterns. Weather conditions in the Gulf Coast region generally result in higher drilling activity in the spring, summer and fall months, with the lowest activity in the winter months. In addition, summer and fall drilling activity can be restricted due to hurricanes and other storms prevalent in the Gulf of Mexico and along the Gulf Coast. As a result of these seasonal differences, full year results are not likely to be a direct multiple of any particular quarter or combination of quarters.\n- 21 -\nWe are exposed to risks relating to subcontractors\u2019 performance in some of our projects.\nIn many cases, we subcontract the performance of portions of our operations to subcontractors. While we seek to obtain appropriate indemnities and guarantees from these subcontractors, we remain ultimately responsible for the performance of our subcontractors. Industrial disputes, natural disasters, financial failure or default, or inadequate performance in the provision of services, or the inability to provide services by such subcontractors, has the potential to materially adversely affect us.\nOur inability to control the inherent risks of identifying and integrating businesses that we may acquire, including any related increases in debt or issuances of equity securities, could adversely affect our operations.\nAcquisitions have been, and our management believes will continue to be, a key element of our growth strategy. However, we may not be able to identify and acquire acceptable acquisition candidates on favorable terms in the future. We may be required to incur substantial indebtedness to finance future acquisitions and also may issue equity securities in connection with such acquisitions. Such additional debt service requirements could impose a significant burden on our results of operations and financial condition. The issuance of additional equity securities could result in significant dilution to stockholders.\nWe expect to gain certain business, financial, and strategic advantages as a result of business combinations we undertake, including synergies and operating efficiencies. Our forward-looking statements assume that we will successfully integrate our business acquisitions and realize these intended benefits. An inability to realize expected financial performance and strategic advantages as a result of the acquisition would negatively affect the anticipated benefits of the acquisition. Additional risks we could face in connection with acquisitions include:\n\u25cf\nretaining key employees of acquired businesses;\n\u25cf\nretaining and attracting new customers of acquired businesses;\n\u25cf retaining supply and distribution relationships key to the supply chain;\n\u25cf increased administrative burden;\n\u25cf developing our sales and marketing capabilities;\n\u25cf managing our growth effectively;\n\u25cf potential goodwill impairment resulting from the overpayment for an acquisition;\n\u25cf\nintegrating operations;\n\u25cf managing tax and foreign exchange exposure;\n\u25cf operating a new line of business;\n\u25cf\nincreased logistical problems common to large, expansive operations;\n\u25cf\ninability to pursue and protect patents covering acquired technology; and\n\u25cf becoming subject to unanticipated liabilities of the acquired business.\nAdditionally, an acquisition may bring us into businesses we have not previously conducted and expose us to additional business risks that are different from those we have previously experienced. If we fail to manage any of these risks successfully, our business could be harmed. Our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly following an acquisition, and stockholders of the Company may not have the opportunity to evaluate the economic, financial, and other relevant information that we will consider in evaluating future acquisitions.\n- 22 -\nWe may not have adequate insurance for potential liabilities and our insurance may not cover certain liabilities, including litigation risks.\nThe products that we manufacture and the services that we provide are complex, and the failure of our equipment to operate properly or to meet specifications may greatly increase our customers\u2019 costs. In addition, many of these products are used in inherently hazardous applications where an accident or product failure can cause personal injury or loss of life, damages to property, equipment, or the environment, regulatory investigations and penalties, and the suspension or cancellation of the end-user\u2019s operations. If our products or services fail to meet specifications, or are involved in accidents or failures, we could face warranty, contract, or other litigation claims for which we may be held responsible and our reputation for providing quality products may suffer. In the ordinary course of business, we become the subject of various claims, lawsuits, and administrative proceedings, seeking damages or other remedies concerning our commercial operations, products, employees, and other matters, including occasional claims by individuals alleging exposure to hazardous materials as a result of our products or operations. Some of these claims relate to the activities of businesses that we have sold, and some relate to the activities of businesses that we have acquired, even though these activities may have occurred prior to our acquisition of such businesses.\nWe maintain insurance to cover many of our potential losses, and we are subject to various self-retentions and deductibles under our insurance policies. It is possible, however, that a judgment could be rendered against us in cases in which we could be uninsured and beyond the amounts that we currently have reserved or anticipate incurring for such matters. Even a partially uninsured or underinsured claim, if successful and of significant size, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or consolidated financial position. We also face the following other risks related to our insurance coverage:\n\u25cf\nwe may not be able to continue to obtain insurance on commercially reasonable terms;\n\u25cf\nwe may be faced with types of liabilities that will not be covered by our insurance, such as damages from environmental contamination or terrorist attacks;\n\u25cf\nthe counterparties to our insurance contracts may pose credit risks; and\n\u25cf\nwe may incur losses from interruption of our business that exceed our insurance coverage.\nOur business could be negatively impacted by security threats, including cybersecurity threats, and other disruptions.\nWe face various security threats, including cybersecurity threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to render data or systems unusable; threats to the safety of our employees; threats to the security of our facilities and infrastructure, or third-party facilities and infrastructure; and threats from terrorist acts. Cybersecurity attacks in particular are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, and corruption of data. Although we utilize various procedures and controls to monitor these threats and mitigate our exposure to such threats, there can be no assurance that these procedures and controls will be sufficient in preventing security threats from materializing. If any of these events were to materialize, they could lead to losses of sensitive information, critical infrastructure, personnel or capabilities, essential to our operations, and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nWe depend on several significant customers in each of our business segments, and the loss of one or more such customers or the inability of one or more such customers to meet their obligations to us, could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWhile no customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues in 2016, 2015 or 2014, we depend on several significant customers in each of our business segments. The loss of a significant portion of customers in any of our business segments, or a sustained decrease in demand by any of such customers, could result in a substantial loss of revenues and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, the concentration of customers in one industry impacts our overall exposure to credit risk, in that customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic and industry conditions. While we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers, we do not generally require collateral in support of our trade receivables.\n- 23 -\nAs a result of our customer concentration, risks of nonpayment and nonperformance by our counterparties are a concern in our business. Many of our customers finance their activities through cash flow from operations, the incurrence of debt, or the issuance of equity. Many of our customers have experienced substantial reductions in their cash flows from operations, and some are experiencing liquidity shortages, lack of access to capital and credit markets, a reduction in borrowing bases under reserve-based credit facilities, and other adverse impacts to their financial condition. These conditions may result in a significant reduction in our customers\u2019 liquidity and ability to pay or otherwise perform on their obligations to us. The inability, or failure of, our significant customers to meet their obligations to us, or their insolvency or liquidation, may adversely affect our financial results.\nOur common stock price has been volatile, and we expect it to continue to remain volatile in the future.\nThe market price of common stock of companies engaged in the oil and natural gas services industry has been highly volatile. Likewise, the market price of our common stock has varied significantly in the past, and we expect it to continue to remain highly volatile given the cyclical nature of our industry.\nWe may assume contractual risks in developing, manufacturing and delivering products in our Offshore Products business segment.\nMany of our products from our Offshore Products segment are ordered by customers under frame agreements or project-specific contracts. In some cases these contracts stipulate a fixed price for the delivery of our products and impose liquidated damages or late delivery fees if we do not meet specific customer deadlines. Our actual costs, and any gross profit realized on these fixed-price contracts, may vary from the initially expected contract economics. In addition, some customer contracts stipulate consequential damages payable, generally as a result of our gross negligence or willful misconduct. The final delivered products may also include customer and third-party supplied equipment, the delay of which can negatively impact our ability to deliver our products on time at our anticipated profitability.\nIn certain cases these orders include new technology or unspecified design elements. There is inherent risk in the estimation process including significant unforeseen technical and logistical challenges, or longer than expected lead times. In some cases we may not be fully, or, properly compensated for the cost to develop and design the final products, negatively impacting our profitability on the projects. In addition, our customers, in many cases, request changes to the original design or bid specifications for which we may not be fully or properly compensated.\nIn fulfilling some contracts, we provide limited warranties for our products. Although we estimate and record a provision for potential warranty claims, repair or replacement costs under warranty provisions in our contracts could exceed the estimated cost to cure the claim, which could be material to our financial results. We utilize percentage-of-completion accounting, depending on the size and length of a project, and variations from estimated contract performance could have a significant impact on our reported operating results as we progress toward completion of major jobs.\nBacklog in our Offshore Products segment is subject to unexpected adjustments and cancellations and is, therefore, an imperfect indicator of our future revenues and earnings.\nThe revenues projected in our Offshore Products segment backlog may not be realized or, if realized, may not result in profits. Because of potential changes in the scope or schedule of our customers\u2019 projects, we cannot predict with certainty when or if backlog will be realized. Material delays, cancellations or payment defaults could materially affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\n- 24 -\nReductions in our backlog due to cancellations or deferrals by customers, or for other reasons, would adversely affect, potentially to a material extent, the revenues and earnings we actually receive from contracts included in our backlog. Some of the contracts in our backlog are cancellable by the customer, subject to the payment of termination fees and/or the reimbursement of our costs incurred. We typically have no contractual right to the total revenues reflected in our backlog once a project is cancelled. While backlog cancellations have not been significant in the past, we incurred cancellations totaling $21.1 million during 2015 and $3.7 million during 2016. If commodity prices do not improve, we may incur additional cancellations or experience continued declines in our backlog during 2017. If we experience significant project terminations, suspensions, or scope adjustments, to contracts included in our backlog, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, may be adversely impacted.\nWe might be unable to employ a sufficient number of technical personnel.\nMany of the products that we sell, especially in our Offshore Products segment, are complex and highly engineered, and often must perform in harsh conditions. We believe that our success depends upon our ability to employ and retain technical personnel with the ability to design, utilize, and enhance these products. In addition, our ability to expand our operations depends in part on our ability to increase our skilled labor force. During periods of increased activity, the demand for skilled workers is high, and the supply is limited. When these events occur, our cost structure increases and our growth potential could be impaired. Conversely, during periods of reduced activity, we are forced to reduce headcount, freeze or reduce wages, and implement other cost-saving measures which could lead to job abandonment by our technical personnel.\nWe might be unable to compete successfully with other companies in our industry.\nThe markets in which we operate are highly competitive and certain of them have relatively few barriers to entry. The principal competitive factors in our markets are product, equipment and service quality, availability, responsiveness, experience, technology, safety performance, and price. In some of our product and service offerings, we compete with the oil and natural gas industry\u2019s largest oilfield service providers. These large national and multi-national companies have longer operating histories, greater financial, technical, and other resources, and greater name recognition than we do. Several of our competitors provide a broader array of services and have a stronger presence in more geographic markets. In addition, we compete with many smaller companies capable of competing effectively on a regional or local basis. Our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and services, and changes in customer requirements. Many contracts are awarded on a bid basis, which further increases competition based on price. As a result of competition, we may lose market share or be unable to maintain or increase prices for our present services, or to acquire additional business opportunities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf we do not develop new competitive technologies and products, our business and revenues may be adversely affected.\nThe market for our products and services is characterized by continual technological developments to provide better performance in increasingly greater water depths, higher pressure levels and harsher conditions. If we are unable to design, develop, and produce commercially, competitive products in a timely manner in response to changes in technology, our business and revenues will be adversely affected. In addition, competitors or customers may develop new technologies, which address similar or improved solutions to our existing technology. Additionally, the development and commercialization of new products and services requires substantial capital expenditures and we may not have access to needed capital at attractive rates or at all due to our financial condition, disruptions of the bank or capital markets, or other reasons beyond our control to continue these activities. Should our technologies become the less attractive solution, our operations and profitability would be negatively impacted.\nWe may be subject to litigation if another party claims that we have infringed upon its intellectual property rights.\nThe tools, techniques, methodologies, programs, and components we use to provide our products and services may infringe, or be alleged to infringe, upon the intellectual property rights of others. Infringement claims generally result in significant legal and other costs, and may distract management from running our core business. Royalty payments under a license from third parties, if available, would increase our costs. If a license were not available, we might not be able to continue providing a particular service or product. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n- 25 -\nDuring periods of strong demand, we may be unable to obtain critical project materials on a timely basis.\nOur operations depend on our ability to procure, on a timely basis, certain project materials, such as forgings, to complete projects in an efficient manner. Our inability to procure critical materials during times of strong demand or at reasonable costs due to supply issues, import taxes or the like, could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nOur oilfield operations involve a variety of operating hazards and risks that could cause losses.\nOur operations are subject to the hazards inherent in the oilfield business. These include, but are not limited to, equipment defects, blowouts, explosions, spills, fires, collisions, capsizing, and severe weather conditions. These hazards could result in personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to, or destruction of, property and equipment, pollution or environmental damage, and suspension of operations. We may incur substantial liabilities or losses as a result of these hazards as part of our ongoing business operations. We may agree to indemnify our customers against specific risks and liabilities. While we maintain insurance protection against some of these risks, and seek to obtain indemnity agreements from our customers requiring the customers to hold us harmless from some of these risks, our insurance and contractual indemnity protection may not be sufficient or effective enough to protect us under all circumstances or against all risks. The occurrence of a significant event not fully insured or indemnified against or the failure of a customer to meet its indemnification obligations to us could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe might be unable to protect our intellectual property rights.\nWe rely on a variety of intellectual property rights that we use in our Offshore Products and Completion Services businesses, particularly our patents relating to our FlexJoint\u00ae and Merlin\u2122 technology and intervention and downhole extended-reach tools (including our HydroPull\u00ae tool) utilized in the completion or workover of oil and natural gas wells. The market success of our technologies will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain and enforce our proprietary rights in these technologies, to preserve rights in our trade secret and non-public information, and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others. We may not be able to successfully preserve these intellectual property rights in the future and these rights could be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. If any of our patents or other intellectual property rights are determined to be invalid or unenforceable, or if a court limits the scope of claims in a patent or fails to recognize our trade secret rights, our competitive advantages could be significantly reduced in the relevant technology, allowing competition for our customer base to increase. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries in which our products and services may be sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. The failure of our Company to protect our proprietary information and any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings against us could adversely affect our competitive position.\n- 26 -\nProvisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could discourage a takeover attempt, which may reduce or eliminate the likelihood of a change of control transaction and, therefore, the ability of our stockholders to sell their shares for a premium.\nProvisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide limitations on the removal of directors, on stockholder proposals at meetings of stockholders, on stockholder action by written consent and on the ability of stockholders to call special meetings, which could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire control of our Company. Our certificate of incorporation also authorizes our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval. If our Board of Directors elects to issue preferred stock, it could increase the difficulty for a third-party to acquire us, which may reduce or eliminate our stockholders' ability to sell their shares of our common stock at a premium.\nThe Spin-Off of Civeo may subject us to future liabilities.\nWe spun off our accommodations business to a stand-alone, publicly traded corporation (\u201cCiveo\u201d) through a tax-free distribution to our stockholders on May 30, 2014.\nPursuant to agreements we entered into with Civeo in connection with the Spin-Off, we and Civeo are each generally responsible for the obligations and liabilities related to our respective businesses. Pursuant to those agreements, we and Civeo each agreed to cross-indemnities principally designed to allocate financial responsibility for the obligations and liabilities of our business to us and those of Civeo\u2019s business to it. However, third parties, including governmental agencies, could seek to hold us responsible for obligations and liabilities that Civeo agreed to retain or assume, and there can be no assurance that the indemnification from Civeo will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such obligations and liabilities, or that Civeo will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. Additionally, if a court were to determine that the Spin-Off or related transactions, including the payment of the dividend we received from Civeo, were consummated with the actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud current or future creditors or resulted in Civeo receiving less than reasonably equivalent value when it was insolvent, or that it was rendered insolvent, inadequately capitalized or unable to pay its debts as they become due, then it is possible that the court could disregard the allocation of obligations and liabilities agreed to between us and Civeo and impose substantial obligations and liabilities on us, void some or all of the Spin-Off transactions or require us to repay some or all of the dividend we received in connection with the Spin-Off. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our financial condition and our results of operations.\nIn connection with the Spin-Off, we received a private letter ruling from the IRS regarding certain aspects of the Spin-Off. The private letter ruling, and an opinion we received from our tax advisor, each rely on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from us and Civeo regarding the past and future conduct of the companies\u2019 respective businesses and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations, or undertakings are, or become, incorrect or not otherwise satisfied, we may not be able to rely on the private letter ruling or the opinion of our tax advisor and could be subject to significant tax liabilities. In addition, an opinion of counsel is not binding upon the IRS, so, notwithstanding the opinion of our tax advisor, the IRS could conclude upon audit that the Spin-Off is taxable in full or in part if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion, or for other reasons, including as a result of certain significant changes in our or Civeo\u2019s stock ownership. If the Spin-Off is determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes for any reason, we and/or our stockholders could incur significant income tax liabilities.", "PERMNO": 88897, "SIC": 3533, "TIC": "OIS"}
