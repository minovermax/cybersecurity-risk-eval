{"cik": "811589", "company": "FIRST BANCORP /NC/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-13", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in our common stock involves certain risks. Before you invest in our common stock, you should be aware that there are various risks, including those described below, which could affect the value of your investment in the future. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment. The risk factors described in this section, as well as any cautionary language in this report, provide examples of risks, uncertainties and events that could have a material adverse effect on our business, including our operating results and financial condition. In addition to the risks and uncertainties described below, other risks and uncertainties not currently known to us, or that we currently deem to be immaterial, also may materially or adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The value or market price of our common stock could decline due to any of these identified or other unidentified risks.\nDifficult market conditions and economic trends have adversely affected our industry and our business.\nA general economic downturn began in the latter half of 2007. Dramatic declines in the housing market, with decreasing home prices and increasing delinquencies and foreclosures, negatively impacted the credit performance of mortgage loans, especially land development loans, and resulted in significant write-downs of assets by many financial institutions. In addition, the value of real estate collateral supporting many loans declined and may decline further. General downward economic trends, reduced availability of commercial credit and high unemployment rates negatively impacted the credit performance of commercial and consumer credit, resulting in additional write-downs. Although the U.S. economy has emerged from the most severe aspects of the recession that occurred in 2008 and 2009, the economy remains fragile, with economic growth slow and uneven, and the Federal Reserve maintaining interest rates at historic lows in an effort to stimulate the economy. And while the national economy has improved, the economic conditions in our market area do not seem to have improved at the same rate. The unemployment rates in most of our markets exceed the national average. We believe that the economic downtrends are largely responsible for the deterioration in loan quality that we have experienced over the past five years, including higher levels of loan charge-offs, higher levels of nonperforming assets, and higher provisions for loan losses. The market turmoil led to increased commercial and consumer delinquencies, lack of confidence, increased market volatility and widespread reduction in general business activity. Financial institutions, including us, have experienced a decrease in access to borrowings. The resulting economic pressure on consumers and businesses and the lack of confidence in the financial markets adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price.\nAs a result of the foregoing factors, there have been numerous new or proposed federal or state laws and regulations regarding lending and funding practices and liquidity standards, and bank regulatory agencies are expected to be very aggressive in responding to concerns and trends identified in examinations. This increased governmental action may increase our costs and limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities.\nOur ability to assess the creditworthiness of customers and to estimate the losses inherent in our credit exposure is made more complex by these prolonged difficult market and economic conditions. A worsening of these conditions would likely exacerbate the adverse effects of these difficult market and economic conditions on us, our customers and the other financial institutions in our market. As a result, we may experience additional increases in foreclosures, delinquencies and customer bankruptcies, as well as more restricted access to funds.\nWe are vulnerable to the economic conditions within the fairly small geographic region in which we operate.\nLike many businesses, our overall success is partially dependent on the economic conditions in the marketplace where we operate. Our marketplace is concentrated in the central Piedmont and coastal regions of North Carolina. Although some improvement has been noted, these regions continue to experience challenging economic conditions, which we believe is a factor in the elevated amounts of borrower delinquencies, nonperforming assets, and loan losses we have experienced during the past few years. If economic conditions in our marketplace worsen, it would likely have an adverse impact on us. In particular, if economic conditions related to real estate values in our marketplace were to worsen, our loan losses would likely increase. At December 31, 2014, approximately 91% of our loans were secured by real estate collateral, which means that additional decreases in real estate values would have an adverse impact on our operations.\nIf our goodwill becomes impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.\nWe have goodwill recorded on our balance sheet as an asset with a carrying value as of December 31, 2014 of $65.8 million. Under generally accepted accounting principles, goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The test for goodwill impairment involves comparing the fair value of a company\u2019s reporting units to their respective carrying values. For our company, our community banking operation is our only material reporting unit. The price of our common stock is one of several measures available for estimating the fair value of our community banking operations. Although the price of our common stock has recently traded above the book value, for most of the last several years, it has traded below the book value of our company. Subject to the results of other valuation techniques, if this situation were to return and persist, it could indicate that our goodwill is impaired. Accordingly, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill is determined, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nWe may be subject to more stringent capital requirements.\nWe are subject to capital adequacy guidelines and other regulatory requirements specifying minimum amounts and types of capital which we must maintain. From time to time, the regulators implement changes to these regulatory capital adequacy guidelines. If we fail to meet these minimum capital guidelines and other regulatory requirements, our financial condition would be materially and adversely affected. Based on recent regulatory capital requirements contained in the Dodd-Frank Act and the regulatory accords on international banking institutions formulated by the Basel Committee and implemented by the Federal Reserve, we will be required to satisfy additional, more stringent, capital adequacy standards. These requirements and any other new regulations, could adversely affect our ability to pay dividends, or could require us to reduce business levels or raise capital, including in ways that may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe might be required to raise additional capital in the future, but that capital may not be available or may not be available on terms acceptable to us when it is needed.\nWe are required to maintain adequate capital levels to support our operations. In the future, we might need to raise additional capital to support growth, absorb loan losses, or meet more stringent capital requirements. Our ability to raise additional capital will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside our control, and on our financial performance. Accordingly, we cannot be certain of our ability to raise additional capital in the future if needed or on terms acceptable to us. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, our ability to conduct our business could be materially impaired.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services companies are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, and investment banks. Defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services companies, or the financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. We can make no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, which could have an adverse effect on our operations.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation and supervision from the North Carolina Commissioner of Banks, the FDIC, and the Federal Reserve Board. This regulation and supervision is intended primarily for the protection of the FDIC insurance fund and our depositors and borrowers, rather than for holders of our equity securities. In the past, our business has been materially affected by these regulations. This trend is likely to continue in the future.\nRegulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on operations, the classification of our assets and the determination of the level of allowance for loan losses. Changes in the regulations that apply to us, or changes in our compliance with regulations, could have a material impact on our operations.\nFinancial reform legislation enacted by the U.S. Congress, and further changes in regulation to which we are exposed, will result in additional new laws and regulations that are expected to increase our costs of operations.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act has and will continue to significantly change bank regulatory structure and affect lending, deposit, investment, and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new rules and regulations, and to prepare numerous studies and reports for Congress. The federal agencies are given significant discretion in drafting and implementing the rules and regulations, and consequently, many of the details and much of the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act may not be known for many months or years. See \u201cLegislative and Regulatory Developments - Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010\u201d above for additional information regarding the Dodd-Frank Act.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act also created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and gave it broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions, including the authority to prohibit \u201cunfair, deceptive or abusive\u201d acts and practices. Additionally, the CFPB has examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than $10 billion in assets.\nProposals for further regulation of the financial services industry are continually being introduced in the United States Congress. The agencies regulating the financial services industry also periodically adopt changes to their regulations. It is possible that additional legislative proposals may be adopted or regulatory changes may be made that would have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, it is expected that such regulatory changes will increase our operating and compliance cost. We can provide no assurance regarding the manner in which new laws and regulations will affect us.\nWe are subject to interest rate risk, which could negatively impact earnings.\nNet interest income is the most significant component of our earnings. Our net interest income results from the difference between the yields we earn on our interest-earning assets, primarily loans and investments, and the rates that we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities, primarily deposits and borrowings. When interest rates change, the yields we earn on our interest-earning assets and the rates we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities do not necessarily move in tandem with each other because of the difference between their maturities and repricing characteristics. This mismatch can negatively impact net interest income if the margin between yields earned and rates paid narrows. Interest rate environment changes can occur at any time and are affected by many factors that are outside our control, including inflation, recession, unemployment trends, the Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policy, domestic and international disorder and instability in domestic and foreign financial markets.\nOur allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual losses.\nLike all financial institutions, we maintain an allowance for loan losses to provide for probable losses caused by customer loan defaults. The allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual loan losses, and in this case additional and larger provisions for loan losses would be required to replenish the allowance. Provisions for loan losses are a direct charge against income.\nWe establish the amount of the allowance for loan losses based on historical loss rates, as well as estimates and assumptions about future events. Because of the extensive use of estimates and assumptions, our actual loan losses could differ, possibly significantly, from our estimate. We believe that our allowance for loan losses is adequate to provide for probable losses, but it is possible that the allowance for loan losses will need to be increased for credit reasons or that regulators will require us to increase this allowance. Either of these occurrences could materially and adversely affect our earnings and profitability.\nIn the normal course of business, we process large volumes of transactions involving millions of dollars. If our internal controls fail to work as expected, if our systems are used in an unauthorized manner, or if our employees subvert our internal controls, we could experience significant losses.\nWe process large volumes of transactions on a daily basis and are exposed to numerous types of operational risk. Operational risk includes the risk of fraud by persons inside or outside the Company, the execution of unauthorized transactions by employees, errors relating to transaction processing and systems and breaches of the internal control system and compliance requirements. This risk also includes potential legal actions that could arise as a result of an operational deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards.\nWe establish and maintain systems of internal operational controls that provide us with timely and accurate information about our level of operational risk. Although not foolproof, these systems have been designed to manage operational risk at appropriate, cost-effective levels. Procedures exist that are designed to ensure that policies relating to conduct, ethics, and business practices are followed. From time to time, losses from operational risk may occur, including the effects of operational errors. We continually monitor and improve our internal controls, data processing systems, and corporate-wide processes and procedures, but there can be no assurance that future losses will not occur.\nNegative public opinion regarding our company and the financial services industry in general, could damage our reputation and adversely impact our earnings.\nReputation risk, or the risk to our business, earnings and capital from negative public opinion regarding our company and the financial services industry in general, is inherent in our business. Negative public opinion can result from actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including lending practices, corporate governance and acquisitions, and from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities. Negative public opinion can adversely affect our ability to keep and attract clients and employees and can expose us to litigation and regulatory action. Although we have taken steps to minimize reputation risk in dealing with our clients and communities, this risk will always be present given the nature of our business.\nOur reported financial results are impacted by management\u2019s selection of accounting methods and certain assumptions and estimates.\nOur accounting policies and methods are fundamental to the way we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. Our management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting policies and methods so they comply with generally accepted accounting principles and reflect management\u2019s judgment of the most appropriate manner to report our financial condition and results. In some cases, management must select the accounting policy or method to apply from two or more alternatives, any of which may be reasonable under the circumstances, yet may result in reporting materially different results than would have been reported under a different alternative.\nCertain accounting policies are critical to presenting our financial condition and results. They require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments about matters that are uncertain. Materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions or estimates. These critical accounting policies include: the allowance for loan losses; intangible assets; and the fair value and discount accretion of loans acquired in FDIC-assisted transactions.\nThere can be no assurance that we will continue to pay cash dividends.\nAlthough we have historically paid cash dividends, there is no assurance that we will continue to pay cash dividends. Future payment of cash dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will be dependent upon our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, economic conditions, and such other factors as the board may deem relevant.\nOur business continuity plans or data security systems could prove to be inadequate, resulting in a material interruption in, or disruption to, our business and a negative impact on our results of operations.\nWe rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business. Our daily operations depend on the operational effectiveness of our technology. We rely on our systems to accurately track and record our assets and liabilities. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of our computer systems or outside technology, whether due to severe weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism, criminal activity or other factors, could result in failures or disruptions in general ledger, deposit, loan, customer relationship management, and other systems leading to inaccurate financial records. This could materially affect our business operations and financial condition. While we have disaster recovery and other policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of any failure, interruption or security breach of our information systems, there can be no assurance that any such failures, interruptions, or security breaches will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. The occurrence of any failures, interruptions or security breaches of our information systems could damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIn addition, the Bank provides its customers the ability to bank online and through mobile banking. The secure transmission of confidential information over the Internet is a critical element of online and mobile banking. While we use qualified third party vendors to test and audit our network, our network could become vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses, phishing schemes and other security issues. The Bank may be required to spend significant capital and other resources to alleviate problems caused by security breaches or computer viruses. To the extent that the Bank\u2019s activities or the activities of its customers involve the storage and transmission of confidential information, security breaches and viruses could expose the Bank to claims, litigation, and other potential liabilities. Any inability to prevent security breaches or computer viruses could also cause existing customers to lose confidence in the Bank\u2019s systems and could adversely affect its reputation and its ability to generate deposits.\nAdditionally, we outsource the processing of our core data system, as well as other systems such as online banking, to third party vendors. Prior to establishing an outsourcing relationship, and on an ongoing basis thereafter, management monitors key vendor controls and procedures related to information technology, which includes reviewing reports of service auditor\u2019s examinations. If our third party provider encounters difficulties or if we have difficulty in communicating with such third party, it will significantly affect our ability to adequately process and account for customer transactions, which would significantly affect our business operations.\nWe rely on certain external vendors.\nWe are reliant upon certain external vendors to provide products and services necessary to maintain our day-to-day operations. Accordingly, our operations are exposed to risk that these vendors will not perform in accordance with applicable contractual arrangements or service level agreements. We maintain a system of policies and procedures designed to monitor vendor risks including, among other things, (i) changes in the vendor\u2019s organizational structure, (ii) changes in the vendor\u2019s financial condition and (iii) changes in the vendor\u2019s support for existing products and services. While we believe these policies and procedures help to mitigate risk, and our vendors are not the sole source of service, the failure of an external vendor to perform in accordance with applicable contractual arrangements or the service level agreements could be disruptive to our operations, which could have a material adverse impact on the our business and its financial condition and results of operations.\nOur potential inability to integrate companies we may acquire in the future could expose us to financial, execution, and operational risks that could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. Acquisitions may be dilutive to common shareholders and FDIC-assisted transactions have additional compliance risk that other acquisitions do not have.\nOn occasion, we may engage in a strategic acquisition when we believe there is an opportunity to strengthen and expand our business. In addition, such acquisitions may involve the issuance of stock, which may have a dilutive effect on earnings per share. To fully benefit from such acquisition, however, we must integrate the administrative, financial, sales, lending, collections, and marketing functions of the acquired company. If we are unable to successfully integrate an acquired company, we may not realize the benefits of the acquisition, and our financial results may be negatively affected. A completed acquisition may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, including our capital requirements and the accounting treatment of the acquisition. Completed acquisitions may also lead to exposure from potential asset quality issues, losses of key employees or customers, difficulty and expense of integrating operations and systems, and significant unexpected liabilities after the consummation of these acquisitions. In addition, if we were to conclude that the value of an acquired business had decreased and that the related goodwill had been impaired, that conclusion would result in a goodwill impairment charge, which would adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe may have opportunities to acquire the assets and liabilities of failed banks in FDIC-assisted transactions. Although these transactions typically provide for FDIC assistance to an acquirer to mitigate certain risks, such as sharing exposure to loan losses and providing indemnification against certain liabilities of the failed institution, we are (and would be in future transactions) subject to many of the same risks we would face in acquiring another bank in a negotiated transaction, including risks associated with maintaining customer relationships and failure to realize the anticipated acquisition benefits in the amounts and within the time frames we expect. In addition, ongoing compliance risk under the loss-share agreement with the FDIC is considerable and the event of noncompliance could result in coverage under the loss-share being disallowed, thus increasing the actual losses to the Bank. Our inability to overcome these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur FDIC loss share agreement related to a high risk loan portfolio acquired in a failed-bank acquisition expired on June 30, 2014, and therefore we bear the full risk of losses for assets related to that agreement subsequent to that date.\nOn June 19, 2009, we acquired Cooperative Bank in a FDIC failed-bank acquisition. As part of the terms of the acquisition, we entered into two loss share agreements with the FDIC - 1) a loss share agreement related to single-family home loans, which has a ten year term, and 2) a loss share agreement for all non-single family loans, which had a five year term. The loss share agreements generally provide us with an 80% reimbursement for all losses incurred and thus they limit our risk. The non-single family loss share agreement related to Cooperative Bank expired on June 30, 2014. The assets covered by the non-single family portfolio included a high percentage of commercial real estate and land development loans, loan types which experienced high loss rates during the economic downturn.\nAt July 1, 2014, the carrying value of the assets covered by the Cooperative Bank non-single family loss-share agreement was approximately $40 million in loans, of which $10 million were on nonaccrual status because of collection problems, and $3 million in foreclosed properties. Accounting regulations require us to record losses as they occur, and thus we believe that we have recorded all probable losses associated with that portfolio as of each period end. However, the value of the underlying collateral for many of the loans, as well as the foreclosed properties, is volatile and has experienced significant declines in recent years. Beginning July 1, 2014, we incur 100% of the loss related to further deterioration of the Cooperative Bank non-single family assets.\nOur FDIC loss share agreement related to a high risk loan portfolio acquired in a failed-bank acquisition expires on March 31, 2016, and therefore we will bear the full risk of losses for assets currently under that agreement subsequent to that date.\nOn January 21, 2011, we acquired The Bank of Asheville in a FDIC failed-bank acquisition. As part of the terms of the acquisition, we entered into two loss share agreements with the FDIC - 1) a loss share agreement related to single-family home loans, which has a ten year term, and 2) a loss share agreement for all non-single family loans, which has a five year term. The loss share agreements generally provide us with an 80% reimbursement for all losses incurred and thus they limit our risk. The non-single family loss share agreement related to The Bank of Asheville expires on March 31, 2016. The assets covered by the non-single family portfolio include a high percentage of commercial real estate and land development loans, loan types which experienced high loss rates during the economic downturn.\nAt December 31, 2014, the carrying value of the assets covered by The Bank of Asheville non-single family loss-share agreement was approximately $30 million in loans, of which $2 million were on nonaccrual status because of collection problems, and $1.2 million in foreclosed properties. Accounting regulations require us to record losses as they occur, and thus we believe that we have recorded all probable losses associated with that portfolio as of each period end. However, the value of the underlying collateral for many of the loans, as well as the foreclosed properties, is volatile and has experienced significant declines in recent years. Beginning April 1, 2016, we will incur 100% of the loss related to further deterioration of The Bank of Asheville non-single family assets.\nOur ability to receive benefits under FDIC loss share agreements is subject to compliance with certain requirements, oversight and interpretation, and contractual term limitations.\nWe receive benefits under loss share agreements with the FDIC in connection with the FDIC-assisted acquisitions of Cooperative Bank in June 2009 and The Bank of Asheville in January 2011. Under these loss share agreements, the FDIC agreed to cover 80% of most loan and foreclosed real estate losses. We are subject to certain obligations under these agreements that prescribe and specify how to manage, service, report, and request reimbursement for losses incurred on covered assets. Our obligations under the loss share agreements are extensive, and failure to comply with any obligations could result in a specific asset, or group of assets, losing loss share coverage. Requests for reimbursement are subject to FDIC review and may be delayed or disallowed if we are not in compliance with our obligations. Losses projected to occur during the loss share term may not be realized until after the expiration of the applicable agreement; consequently, those losses may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, we are subject to FDIC audits to ensure compliance with the loss share agreements. The loss share agreements are subject to interpretation by us and the FDIC; therefore, disagreements may arise regarding the coverage of losses, expenses, and contingencies.", "PERMNO": 11285, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "FBNC"}
