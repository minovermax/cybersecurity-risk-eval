RISK FACTORS\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital\nWe have incurred significant losses since our inception. We expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future and may never achieve product commercialization or profitability.\nSince our inception in December 2003, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our net losses were approximately $18.7 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. As of September 30, 2015, we had a deficit accumulated since inception of approximately $248.3 million. We have invested a significant portion of our efforts and financial resources in the development of our RHI- and insulin analog-based ultra-rapid-acting insulin product candidates, including BIOD-123, BIOD-531, BIOD-238, BIOD-250, and our prior Linjeta\u2122 formulation. More recently, we have invested an increasing portion of our efforts and financial resources in the development of our GEM product candidate; however, timing of the development program for our GEM product candidate is uncertain. Further progress requires that Unilife deliver to us at least three registration batches of the fully filled and finished GEM device so that we may conduct the pivotal clinical study, human factors study and stability studies required for an NDA submission to the FDA. Previously, we anticipated that Unilife would deliver the registration batches toward the end of the 2015 calendar year. Unilife has informed us, however, that the projected GEM device development timelines are no longer accurate, and discussions with Unilife to resolve a dispute regarding the requirements of our customization and commercial supply contract with them have been unsuccessful. We have initiated formal legal proceedings in Superior Court in the State of Connecticut and with the American Arbitration Association to address Unilife's alleged violation of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act, or CUTPA, and alleged breaches of contract in connection with the GEM program. Until such time as we are able to resolve these matters, if at all, we will be unable to continue to develop our GEM product candidate. We cannot give any assurance as to the outcome of our legal proceedings with Unilife.\nWe expect to continue to incur significant operating losses for at least the next several years as we may:\n\u2022explore various strategic alternatives with the assistance of an advisor, and possibly execute on one such alternative;\n\u2022continue our efforts to confirm the development timelines for the Unilife device intended for use with our GEM product candidate, including through formal legal proceedings;\n\u2022pay milestone payments to Unilife in connection with the production and delivery of registration batches of our GEM product candidate to support the submission of an NDA with the FDA;\n\u2022conduct later stage clinical trials with our GEM product candidate, including at least one pivotal clinical trial required for FDA approval of an NDA, and commence targeted commercialization activities;\n\u2022conduct clinical trials with our BIOD-531 product candidate, including possibly a Phase 2, parallel group study in patients with Type 2 diabetes over several treatment periods;\n\u2022conduct the required stability, preclinical and human factors and user acceptability studies to support the approval of the GEM device and one or more insulin injection devices intended for use with BIOD-531; and\n\u2022purchase active pharmaceutical ingredients and other materials in support of our product candidates.\nTo become and remain profitable, we must succeed in developing and eventually commercializing drugs with significant market potential. This will require us to be successful in a range of challenging activities, including developing proprietary insulin and glucagon product candidates with desirable pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, stability and injection site toleration characteristics and then successfully completing preclinical testing and clinical trials for these formulations, obtaining regulatory approval for these formulations and manufacturing, marketing and selling those products for which we may obtain regulatory approval. We may never succeed in these activities and may never generate revenues that are significant or large enough to achieve profitability. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become and remain profitable could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business or continue our operations. A decline in the market price of our common stock could also cause you to lose all or a part of your investment.\nWe will need substantial additional funding and may be unable to raise capital when needed, which would force us to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs or commercialization efforts.\nWe are an early stage company with no commercial products. All of our product candidates are in the initial stages of development. Our product candidates will require significant additional clinical development, regulatory approvals and related investment before they can be commercialized. We expect to continue to incur significant research and development expenses as we continue our formulation work and advance these programs through clinical trials. Unless we are successful in consummating a strategic partnership to develop and commercialize an ultra-rapid-acting insulin formulation or a glucagon rescue presentation, we would need to raise substantial additional capital to develop and commercialize competitive products. Such financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If we are unable to obtain financing on favorable terms, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.\nBased upon our current plans, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash will be sufficient to fund our anticipated operating expenses and capital expenditures at least through the first calendar quarter of 2017. However, we cannot assure you that our plans will not change or that changed circumstances will not result in the depletion of our capital resources more rapidly than we currently anticipate. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022the success of our efforts, and those of our advisors, in exploring, and possibly executing on, our strategic alternatives, while preserving our cash balance to the extent practicable;\n\u2022the progress, timing or success of our research and development and clinical programs for our product candidates, particularly our GEM and BIOD-531 product candidates;\n\u2022our ability to conduct the development work necessary to finalize the formulation and presentation of our GEM product candidate, as well as the preclinical studies, clinical trials and manufacturing activities necessary to support the submission of an NDA to the FDA for that product candidate;\n\u2022the ability and willingness of our existing strategic partners, service providers and suppliers, upon which we rely in the advancement of our product candidates, to meet the obligations set forth in our agreements with them, including Unilife, which is responsible for designing and manufacturing the device intended for use with our GEM product candidate, as well as delivering three registration lots of the filled and finished GEM device required for submitting an NDA to the FDA;\n\u2022the results of our real-time stability programs for our glucagon-, RHI-, and insulin analog-based product candidates, including the reproducibility of earlier, smaller scale, stability studies and our ability to accurately project long term stability on the basis of accelerated testing;\n\u2022our ability to accurately anticipate technical challenges that we may face in the development of our product candidates;\n\u2022our ability to secure approval by the FDA for our product candidates under Section 505(b)(2) of the FFDCA;\n\u2022the degree of clinical utility of our product candidates, particularly with regard to our ultra-rapid-acting insulin formulations, which have not yet been shown to be clinically superior to existing rapid-acting insulin analogs;\n\u2022our ability to enter into collaboration arrangements for the commercialization of our product candidates and the success or failure of any such collaborations into which we enter, or our ability to commercialize our product candidates ourselves;\n\u2022our ability to enforce our patents for our product candidates and our ability to secure additional patents for our product candidates;\n\u2022our ability to protect our intellectual property and operate our business without infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others;\n\u2022the emergence of competing technologies and products and other adverse market developments, such as advancements in glucagon stabilization technologies or delivery devices, that could enable a room-temperature rescue product in a portable, easy to use presentation;\n\u2022the ability of our contract manufacturing organizations or collaborators to timely and properly produce our products in our final dosage form and in the quantities we may require;\n\u2022our ability to secure adequate supplies of active pharmaceutical ingredients to support our product development programs and, if successful, the commercialization one or more product candidates;\n\u2022our capabilities and strategies for manufacturing, marketing and commercializing a product candidate; and\n\u2022our ability to accurately estimate anticipated operating losses, future revenues, capital requirements and our needs for additional financing.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through public or private equity offerings and debt financings, strategic collaborations and licensing arrangements. If we raise additional funds by issuing additional equity securities, our stockholders will experience dilution. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. Any debt financing or additional equity that we raise may contain terms, such as liquidation and other preferences, which are not favorable to us or our stockholders. If we raise additional funds through collaboration, strategic alliance or licensing arrangements with third parties, it may be necessary to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies or product candidates, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us.\nOur short operating history may make it difficult for you to evaluate the success of our business to date and to assess our future viability.\nWe commenced active operations in January 2004. Our operations to date have been limited to organizing and staffing our company, developing and securing our technology and undertaking preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates. We have limited experience completing large-scale, pivotal clinical trials and we have not yet demonstrated our ability to obtain regulatory approval to market a product, manufacture a commercial scale product, or arrange for a third party to do so on our behalf, or conduct sales and marketing activities necessary for successful product commercialization. Consequently, any predictions you make about our future success or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer operating history.\nIn addition, as a relatively new business, we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other known and unknown factors. We may need to transition from a company with a research focus to a company capable of supporting commercial activities. We may not be successful in such a transition.\nRisks Related to the Development and Commercialization of Our Product Candidates\nWe have depended heavily on the success of our glucagon emergency rescue and ultra-rapid-acting mealtime insulin development programs.\nWe have invested a significant portion of our efforts and financial resources in the development of our glucagon emergency rescue and ultra-rapid-acting insulin product candidates. We submitted an IND to the FDA for our GEM product candidate in the third calendar quarter of 2014, and in the first calendar quarter of 2015, we announced positive topline results from Study 6-101, which compared our candidate glucagon formulation, BIOD-961, to the glucagon formulations marketed by Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk. However, the timing of the development program for our GEM product candidate is dependent the ability of Unilife to deliver to us at least three registration batches of the fully filled and finished GEM device so that we may conduct the pivotal clinical study, human factors study and stability studies required for an NDA submission to the FDA. Previously, we anticipated that Unilife would deliver the registration batches toward the end of the 2015 calendar year. However, Unilife informed us that the projected GEM device development timelines were no longer accurate, and discussions with Unilife to resolve a dispute regarding the requirements of our customization and commercial supply contract with them were unsuccessful. We have initiated formal legal proceedings in Superior Court in the State of Connecticut and with the American Arbitration Association to address Unilife's alleged violation of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act, or CUTPA, and alleged\nbreaches of contract in connection with the GEM program. Until such time as we are able to resolve these matters, if at all, we will be unable to continue to develop our GEM product candidate. We cannot give any assurance as to the outcome of our legal proceedings with Unilife.\nSince November 2010, when the FDA issued a complete response letter to our NDA for our Linjeta\u2122 product candidate, we have studied newer formulations of ultra-rapid-acting insulins in earlier stage clinical trials. Clinical trials of our first two new RHI-based formulations, BIOD-105 and BIOD-107, did not achieve satisfactory results. A subsequent RHI-based formulation, BIOD-123, met the primary non-inferiority endpoint in a Phase 2 clinical trial. To date, however, we have been unable to engage a strategic partner in the advancement of the candidate formulation into later stages of development, and we have no plans to do so on our own. Most recently, we have selected BIOD-531 as our lead candidate for a concentrated ultra-rapid-acting RHI-based formulation based on positive results we observed in early stage clinical trials. The results of our earlier stage clinical trials may not be predictive of results we may generate in later stage clinical trials. We have not studied BIOD-531 in multi-dose outpatient clinical trials, which may be more representative of the product candidate's intended use as a long-term therapy. Additionally, we have manufactured a limited number of larger-scale batches of BIOD-531 from which to generate real-time stability data.\nOur development of an RHI- or insulin analog-based formulation may not be successful; some formulations may have different regulatory requirements to obtain marketing approval from the FDA.\nWhile we have significant experience with the technology we use to develop ultra-rapid-acting insulin formulations, we cannot assure you that our program to advance RHI- or insulin analog-based formulations will be successful or will offer improvements over the Linjeta\u2122 formulation that we submitted to the FDA in our NDA. Some of our formulations offer advantages in terms of injection site toleration, but may not perform as well as the Linjeta\u2122 formulation in terms of the overall pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile. Some of our insulin analog-based formulations under development appear to be absorbed as rapidly as Linjeta\u2122, but are less stable in accelerated testing. For example, BIOD-238 and BIOD-250 do not demonstrate stability characteristics consistent with our target product profile. Accordingly, we are continuing our formulation development work to improve the stability characteristics of our ultra-rapid-acting insulin analog-based formulations. We may be unable to develop new RHI- or insulin analog-based formulations with pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, stability and injection site toleration characteristics that are acceptable to us, a potential strategic partner or the FDA.\nFurthermore, the regulatory requirements for any alternate formulation may not meet our expectations or may be different from those applicable to the formulation of Linjeta\u2122 submitted in our NDA. For example, advancing any formulation based on an insulin analog may necessitate our conducting additional toxicology work prior to initiation of clinical trials in the United States. While BIOD-238 and BIOD-250, which are formulated by adding our proprietary excipients to the marketed presentation of Humalog\u00ae, were the subject of a Phase 1 clinical trial in Australia, we expect that we would need to conduct toxicology studies before advancing our insulin analog-based formulations into a Phase 1 clinical trial in the United States.\nOur development of a glucagon rescue product candidate may not be successful; we have limited experience with developing drug-device combination products and rely heavily on the performance of third parties collaborators and consultants.\nOur experience with the manufacture, testing and analysis of pharmaceutical preparations of glucagon in preclinical studies is limited, and we have not yet concluded any clinical trials using glucagon as an active pharmaceutical ingredient. Additionally, we have never prepared or submitted an NDA to the FDA for a drug-device combination product, such as our GEM product candidate, and we therefore rely heavily on the expertise of third-party collaborators and consultants, such as Unilife, which is responsible for the design and the development phase manufacturing of the GEM device, as well as for the device-specific portions of any NDA we may submit to the FDA. If we, or our consultants and collaborators, do not adequately anticipate or address technical and regulatory challenges that we may face in the development of our GEM product candidate, our business may be significantly harmed.\nThe results of preclinical testing and clinical trials do not ensure success in future clinical trials or commercial success.\nWe have not completed the development of any products through commercialization. In October 2010, the FDA notified us that it would not approve our NDA for the Linjeta\u2122 formulation, and we subsequently\nadvanced alternate formulations, including BIOD-105, BIOD-107, BIOD-123, BIOD-125, BIOD-238, BIOD-250 and BIOD-531into the clinic and discontinued development of earlier formulations of Linjeta\u2122. The outcomes of preclinical testing and clinical trials of our product candidates may not be predictive of the success of future clinical trials. For example, despite promising preclinical data, BIOD-105 and BIOD-107 did not meet our preferred target product profile in Phase 1 clinical trials, and we discontinued development of these formulations. In addition, interim or preliminary results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results. We cannot assure you that the clinical trials of any of our product candidates will ultimately be successful. New information regarding the safety, efficacy, toleration and stability may arise that may be less favorable than the data observed to date.\nIf we are not successful in commercializing any of our product candidates, or are significantly delayed in doing so, our business will be materially harmed. The commercial success of our product candidates will depend on several factors, including the following:\n\u2022successful completion of preclinical development and clinical trials;\n\u2022our ability to identify and enroll patients who meet clinical trial eligibility criteria;\n\u2022receipt of marketing approvals from the FDA and similar regulatory authorities outside the United States;\n\u2022establishing that, with regard to our ultra-rapid-acting insulin formulations, the formulations are well-tolerated in chronic use;\n\u2022establishing that, with regard to our GEM product candidate, the commercial presentation can be administered effectively by patient caregivers with limited or no training;\n\u2022establishing commercial manufacturing capabilities through arrangements with third-party manufacturers;\n\u2022launching commercial sales of the products, whether alone or in collaboration with others;\n\u2022competition from other products; and\n\u2022continued acceptable safety profiles of the products following approval.\nIf our clinical trials are delayed or do not produce positive results, we may incur additional costs and ultimately be unable to commercialize our product candidates.\nBefore obtaining regulatory approval for the sale of our product candidates, we must conduct, at our own expense, extensive preclinical tests to demonstrate the safety of our product candidates in animals and clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in humans. Preclinical and clinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and is uncertain as to outcome. A failure of one or more of our clinical trials for ultra-rapid-acting insulin or GEM product candidates could occur at any stage of testing. We may experience numerous unforeseen events during our clinical trials that could delay or prevent our ability to receive regulatory approval or commercialize our product candidates, including:\n\u2022the number of patients required for our clinical trials may be larger than we anticipate, enrollment in our clinical trials may be slower than we currently anticipate, or participants may drop out of our clinical trials at a higher rate than we anticipate, any of which would result in significant delays;\n\u2022our third-party contractors may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner;\n\u2022we might have to suspend or terminate our clinical trials if the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;\n\u2022regulators or institutional review boards may require that we hold, suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements;\n\u2022the cost of our clinical trials may be greater than we anticipate;\n\u2022the supply, stability or quality of our product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct our clinical trials may be insufficient or inadequate; and\n\u2022the effects of our product candidates may not be the desired effects, may include undesirable side effects or the product candidates may have other unexpected characteristics.\nIf we are required to conduct additional clinical trials or other testing of our product candidates beyond those that we currently contemplate, if we are unable to successfully complete our clinical trials or other testing, if the results of these trials or tests are not positive or are only modestly positive or if there are safety concerns, we may:\n\u2022be delayed in obtaining or discontinue our efforts to obtain marketing approval;\n\u2022not be able to obtain marketing approval;\n\u2022obtain approval for indications that are not as broad as intended; or\n\u2022have the product removed from the market after obtaining marketing approval.\nOur product development costs will also increase if we experience delays in testing or approvals. We do not know whether any preclinical tests or clinical trials will begin as planned, will need to be redesigned or will be completed on schedule, if at all. Significant preclinical or clinical trial delays also could shorten any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidates or allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do and impair our ability to commercialize our products or product candidates and may harm our business and results of operations.\nIf our product candidates are found to cause undesirable side effects we may need to delay or abandon our development and commercialization efforts.\nAny undesirable side effects that might be caused by our product candidates could interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in the denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other regulatory authorities for any or all targeted indications. In addition, if any of our product candidates receive marketing approval and we or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by the product, we could face one or more of the following:\n\u2022a change in the labeling statements or withdrawal of FDA or other regulatory approval of the product;\n\u2022a change in the way the product is administered; or\n\u2022the need to conduct additional clinical trials.\nAny of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product or could substantially increase the costs and expenses of commercializing the product, which in turn could delay or prevent us from generating significant revenues from its sale.\nThe commercial success of any product candidates that we may develop will depend upon the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, healthcare payors and others in the medical community.\nAny products that we bring to the market may not gain market acceptance by physicians, patients, healthcare payors and others in the medical community. If these products do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate significant product revenues and we may not become profitable. Physicians will not recommend our product candidates until clinical data or other factors demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates as compared to other treatments. Even if the clinical safety and efficacy of our product candidates are established, physicians may elect not to recommend these product candidates for a variety of reasons including the reimbursement policies of government and third-party payors, the effectiveness of our competitors in marketing their products and the possibility that patients may experience more injection site discomfort than they experience with competing products.\nThe degree of market acceptance of our product candidates, if approved for commercial sale, will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022the willingness and ability of patients and the healthcare community to adopt our products;\n\u2022the ability to manufacture our product candidates in sufficient quantities with acceptable quality and to offer our product candidates for sale at competitive prices;\n\u2022the perception of patients and the healthcare community, including third-party payors, regarding the safety, efficacy and benefits of our product candidates compared to those of competing products or therapies;\n\u2022the convenience and ease of administration of our product candidates relative to existing treatment methods;\n\u2022the label and promotional claims allowed by the FDA, such as, in the case of an RHI- or insulin analog-based formulation, claims relating to glycemic control, hypoglycemia, weight gain, injection site discomfort, expiry dating and required handling conditions;\n\u2022the pricing and reimbursement of our product candidates relative to existing treatments; and\n\u2022marketing and distribution support for our product candidates.\nOur ultra-rapid-acting insulin formulations have not yet been shown to be clinically superior to existing rapid-acting insulin analogs or other marketed comparators, such as Humulin\u00ae R U-500 and Humalog\u00ae Mix 75/25. It may be difficult for us to demonstrate superiority in the future because we anticipate that the primary endpoint of any pivotal clinical trial that we might conduct with an ultra-rapid-acting insulin product candidate would be non-inferiority to the comparator drug product. In addition, we are aware of other companies with expertise in protein stabilization that are developing novel formulations and presentations of stable glucagon. If these formulations and presentations are easier to administer than our GEM product candidate, our GEM product candidate, even if approved by the FDA, may not achieve commercial success.\nThe successful development of our product candidates may depend upon our ability to collaborate with or license technology from third parties.\nBIOD-531 is at an early stage of development. In order for us to meet our projected milestones for this program, we must obtain a reliable source of active pharmaceutical ingredient and other related materials and supplies, including insulin injection devices or syringes that may be unique to BIOD-531 and its insulin concentration. In addition, with regard to our GEM product candidate, we are dependent upon proprietary licenses and supply arrangements we have with third parties, such as Unilife, which is responsible for designing and manufacturing the GEM device, as well as delivering three registration lots of the filled and finished GEM device required for submitting an NDA to the FDA. If we are unable to establish or maintain these licenses and supply arrangements, our efforts to commercialize our product candidates may be materially harmed.\nIf we fail to enter into strategic collaborations for the commercialization of our product candidates or if our collaborations are unsuccessful, we may be delayed in our commercialization efforts; we may be required to establish our own sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution capabilities which will be expensive, require additional capital we do not currently have, and could delay the commercialization of our product candidates and have a material and adverse effect on our business.\nOur current strategy for developing, manufacturing and commercializing our product candidates includes securing collaborations with leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, including those that hold patents covering the currently marketed insulin analogs. To date, we have not entered into any out-licensing collaborations with pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies. We face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators. In addition, collaboration agreements are complex and time-consuming to negotiate, document and implement. For all these reasons, it may be difficult for us to find third parties that are willing to enter into collaborations on economic terms that are favorable to us, or at all. Even if we do enter into any such collaboration, the collaboration may not be successful. The success of our collaboration arrangements will depend heavily on the efforts and activities of our collaborators. It is likely that our collaborators will have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaborations.\nIf we fail to enter into collaborations, or if our collaborations are unsuccessful, we may be required to establish our own direct sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution capabilities. Establishing these capabilities can be time-consuming and expensive and we have little experience in doing so. Because of our\nsize, we would be at a disadvantage to our potential competitors to the extent they collaborate with large pharmaceutical companies that have substantially more resources than we do. As a result, we would not initially be able to field a sales force as large as our competitors or provide the same degree of market research or marketing support. In addition, our competitors would have a greater ability to devote research and development resources toward expansion of the indications for their products. We cannot assure our investors that we will succeed in entering into acceptable collaborations, that any such collaboration will be successful or, if not, that we will successfully develop our own sales, marketing and distribution capabilities.\nIf we are unable to obtain adequate reimbursement from governments or third-party payors for any products that we may develop or if we are unable to obtain acceptable prices for those products, they may not be purchased or used and our potential revenues and prospects for profitability will suffer.\nOur potential future revenues and profits will depend heavily upon the availability of adequate reimbursement for the use of any approved product candidates from governmental and other third-party payors, both in the United States and in other markets. Reimbursement by a third-party payor may depend upon a number of factors, including the third-party payor's determination that use of a product is:\n\u2022a covered benefit under its health plan;\n\u2022safe, effective and medically necessary;\n\u2022appropriate for the specific patient;\n\u2022cost-effective; and\n\u2022neither experimental nor investigational.\nObtaining reimbursement approval for a product from each government or other third-party payor is a time-consuming and costly process that could require us to provide supporting scientific, clinical and cost-effectiveness data for the use of our products to each payor. We may not be able to provide data sufficient to gain acceptance with respect to reimbursement. Even when a payor determines that a product is eligible for reimbursement, the payor may impose coverage limitations that preclude payment for some uses that are approved by the FDA or comparable authorities. In addition, eligibility for coverage does not imply that any product will be reimbursed in all cases or at a rate that allows us to make a profit or even cover our costs.\nInterim payments for new products, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover our costs and may not be made permanent.\nGovernments outside the United States tend to impose strict price controls, which may adversely affect our revenues, if any.\nIn some countries, particularly the countries of the European Union, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a product. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our product candidate to other available therapies. If reimbursement of our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, our business could be adversely affected.\nProduct liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to limit commercialization of any products that we may develop.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of our product candidates in human clinical trials and will face an even greater risk if we commercially sell any products that we may develop. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that our product candidates or products caused injuries, we will incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u2022decreased demand for any product candidates or products that we may develop;\n\u2022injury to our reputation;\n\u2022withdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u2022costs to defend the related litigation;\n\u2022substantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;\n\u2022loss of revenue; and\n\u2022the inability to commercialize any products that we may develop.\nWe currently carry liability insurance that we believe is sufficient to cover us from potential damages arising from past or future clinical trials of our ultra-rapid-acting insulin formulations and other product candidates that we may advance into the clinic. The amount of insurance that we currently hold may not be adequate to cover all liabilities that we may incur. We intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products if we obtain marketing approval for any products. Insurance coverage is increasingly expensive. We may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost. If losses from product liability claims exceed our liability insurance coverage, we may ourselves incur substantial liabilities. If we are required to pay a product liability claim, we may not have sufficient financial resources to complete development or commercialization of any of our product candidates and, if so, our business and results of operations would be harmed.\nWe face substantial competition in the development of our product candidates which may result in others developing or commercializing products before or more successfully than we do.\nWe are engaged in segments of the pharmaceutical industry that are characterized by intense competition and rapidly evolving technology. Many large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations are pursuing the development of novel drugs that target endocrine disorders. We face, and expect to continue to face, intense and increasing competition as new products enter the market and advanced technologies become available.\nIf approved, our GEM product candidate would face significant competition. Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk currently market injectable glucagon rescue kit products. We are aware of several additional glucagon rescue product candidates. Eli Lilly has acquired worldwide rights to a clinical-stage intranasal glucagon product candidate developed by Locemia Solutions, or Locemia, a privately held specialty pharmaceutical company. Locemia's product candidate uses a proprietary glucagon nasal powder formulation that is delivered in a single-use device. Xeris Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Xeris, is developing a clinical-stage glucagon product candidate that is stabilized using non-aqueous solvents to suppress glucagon fibrillation. At the 2014 Annual Meeting of the American Diabetes Association, Xeris presented data from a Phase 2, double-blind, crossover, comparative pharmacology study in healthy non-diabetic volunteers in which the Xeris candidate formulation demonstrated pharmacodynamic bioequivalence to a marketed comparator (although the pharmacokinetic profiles of the 2 glucagon formulations were significantly different). In April 2015, Xeris announced that it was awarded a Small Business Innovation Research Phase I grant to advance the company's non-aqueous glucagon candidate. Zosano Pharma Corporation, or Zosano, is developing a clinical-stage glucagon formulation delivered intra-dermally by a micro needle patch. In addition, Zealand Pharma A/S, a pharmaceutical company based in Denmark, is developing a clinical-stage glucagon analog that is designed to be more stable than glucagon while maintaining glucagon's clinical efficacy.\nOur concentrated ultra-rapid acting insulin product candidate, BIOD-531, if approved, would face significant competition from insulin formulations currently on the market and, potentially, from development stage insulin formulations and other treatment systems. Humulin\u00ae R U-500 is commonly used to treat diabetes patients with severe insulin resistance, and pre-mixed insulins, such as Humalog\u00ae Mix 75/25, is commonly used to treat diabetes patients and lesser degrees of insulin resistance. Newer combination products may also compete with BIOD-531. For example, a combination of insulin degludec, an ultra-long-acting basal insulin developed by Novo Nordisk, and NovoLog\u00ae is approved in Europe and may be approved in the United States within the next few years. Also, combinations of basal insulin and GLP-1 analogs have either been approved or are in later stages of development; these products are believed to offer some measure of postprandial glucose control in addition to the control offered by a basal insulin. Furthermore, Thermalin Diabetes, LLC and Adocia Inc. have announced plans to develop a novel concentrated insulin-analog based formulation with fast absorption.\nIf approved, the primary competition for our BIOD-123 ultra-rapid-acting insulin product candidate will be rapid-acting mealtime injectable insulins. There are several approved injectable rapid-acting mealtime\ninsulin analogs currently on the market including Humalog\u00ae, marketed by Eli Lilly and Company, NovoLog\u00ae, marketed by Novo Nordisk, and Apidra\u00ae, marketed by Sanofi. These rapid-acting insulin analogs provide improvement over \"regular\" mealtime insulin, including faster subcutaneous absorption, an earlier and greater insulin peak and more rapid post-peak decrease. Both Humalog\u00ae and NovoLog\u00ae have limited remaining patent protection in the United States and Europe. The possible introduction of lower priced brands or substitutable generic versions of these products could negatively impact the revenue potential of our ultra-rapid-acting product candidates should any be approved.\nPotential competitors also include academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization. Our competitors may develop products that are more effective, safer, more convenient or less costly than any that we are developing or that would render our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive. Our competitors may also obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours.\nMany of our potential competitors have:\n\u2022significantly greater financial, technical and human resources than we have and may be better equipped to discover, develop, manufacture and commercialize product candidates;\n\u2022more extensive experience in preclinical testing and clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and manufacturing and marketing pharmaceutical products;\n\u2022product candidates that have been approved or are in late-stage clinical development; or\n\u2022collaborative arrangements in our target markets with leading companies and research institutions.\nOur product candidates may be rendered obsolete by technological change.\nThe rapid rate of scientific discoveries and technological changes could result in one or more of our product candidates becoming obsolete or noncompetitive. For several decades, scientists have attempted to improve the bioavailability of injected formulations and to devise alternative non-invasive delivery systems for the delivery of drugs such as insulin. Our product candidates will compete against many products with similar indications. Our future success will depend not only on our ability to develop our product candidates, but also on our ability to maintain market acceptance against emerging industry developments. We cannot assure current or prospective stockholders that we will be able to do so.\nOur business activities involve the storage and use of hazardous materials, which require compliance with environmental and occupational safety laws regulating the use of such materials. If we violate these laws, we could be subject to significant fines, liabilities or other adverse consequences.\nOur research and development work and manufacturing processes involve the controlled storage and use of hazardous materials, including chemical and biological materials. Our operations also produce hazardous waste products. We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these materials. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials and waste products comply in all material respects with the standards prescribed by federal, state and local laws and regulations, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from hazardous materials cannot be completely eliminated. In the event of an accident or failure to comply with environmental laws, we could be held liable for any damages that may result, and any such liability could fall outside the coverage or exceed the limits of our insurance. In addition, we could be required to incur significant costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations in the future or pay substantial fines or penalties if we violate any of these laws or regulations. Finally, current or future environmental laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties\nUse of third parties to manufacture our product candidates may increase the risks that we will not have sufficient quantities of our product candidates or such quantities at an acceptable cost or on a timely basis, or that our contract manufacturers will not be able to manufacture our products in their final dosage form. In any such case, clinical development and commercialization of our product candidates could be delayed, prevented or impaired.\nWe do not currently own or operate manufacturing facilities for commercial production of our product candidates. We have limited experience in drug manufacturing and we lack the resources and the capabilities to manufacture any of our product candidates on a clinical or commercial scale. Our current strategy is to outsource to third parties all of the manufacturing required for our product candidates, including the component parts of the GEM device and activities associated with assembling, filling, finishing and packaging that device.\nUnder our customization and commercial supply agreement with Unilife, Unilife will develop and be the sole supplier of the GEM device. The initial term of our agreement with Unilife will expire in 2028. However, timing of the development program for our GEM product candidate is uncertain. Further progress requires at least three registration batches of the fully filled and finished GEM device so that we may conduct the pivotal clinical study, human factors study and stability studies required for an NDA submission to the FDA. Previously, we anticipated that Unilife would deliver the registration batches toward the end of the 2015 calendar year. Unilife has informed us, however, that the projected GEM device development timelines are no longer accurate, and discussions with Unilife to resolve a dispute regarding the requirements of our customization and commercial supply contract with them have been unsuccessful. We have initiated formal legal proceedings in Superior Court in the State of Connecticut and with the American Arbitration Association to address Unilife's alleged violation of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act, or CUTPA, and alleged breaches of contract in connection with the GEM program. Until such time as we are able to resolve these matters, if at all, we will be unable to continue to develop our GEM product candidate. We cannot give any assurance as to the outcome of our legal proceedings with Unilife.\nWe have entered into a manufacturing agreement with Emergent, under which Emergent will fill and finish the GEM device, using lyophilized glucagon and an aqueous diluent. During the term of our agreement with Emergent following validation of the manufacturing process, we are required to purchase, and Emergent is obligated to deliver to us, one manufactured lot of the GEM device every quarter. However, we would likely require additional manufacturing capacity in order for any commercial launch of our GEM product candidate to be successful.\nWith regard to our ultra-rapid-acting insulin formulations, including BIOD-531, we have recently relied on the University of Iowa for manufacturing services. We do not have any commercial manufacturing agreements in place with third parties to support these product candidates.\nReliance on third-party manufacturers entails risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured product candidates or products ourselves, including:\n\u2022reliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance;\n\u2022the possible breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party because of factors beyond our control; and\n\u2022the possible refusal by or inability of the third party to support our manufacturing programs in a time frame that we would otherwise prefer.\nOur manufacturers may not be able to comply with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, regulations or other regulatory requirements or similar regulatory requirements outside the United States. Our manufacturers are subject to unannounced inspections by the FDA, state regulators and similar regulators outside the United States. Our failure, or the failure of our third-party manufacturers, to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, failure of regulatory authorities to grant marketing approval of our product candidates, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of product candidates or products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could significantly and adversely affect supplies of our product candidates.\nOur product candidates and any products that we may develop may compete with other product candidates and products for access to manufacturing facilities. There are a limited number of manufacturers that operate under cGMP regulations and that are both capable of manufacturing for us and willing to do so. If the third parties that we engage to manufacture product for our clinical trials should cease to continue to do so for any reason, we likely would experience delays in advancing these trials while we identify and qualify replacement suppliers and we may be unable to obtain replacement supplies on terms that are favorable to us. In addition, if we are not able to obtain adequate supplies of our product candidates or the drug substances used to manufacture them, it will be more difficult for us to develop our product candidates and compete effectively.\nOur current and anticipated future dependence upon others for the manufacture of our product candidates may adversely affect our future profit margins and our ability to develop product candidates and commercialize any products that receive regulatory approval on a timely and competitive basis.\nWe rely on third parties for design and engineering expertise relating to the development of devices we may use to administer the pharmaceutical preparations of our product candidates.\nThe success of certain of our product candidates is likely to depend heavily on the design of the devices being used for the administration of our pharmaceutical preparations. For example, the GEM device, which is based on an existing technology platform developed by Unilife Corporation, is being customized by Unilife for use in an emergency situation. We do not have internal engineering expertise relating to medical devices, and we therefore rely on Unilife to provide such expertise. If our collaboration with Unilife is not successful in this regard, our program to develop our GEM product candidate will be materially harmed. Additionally, in order to maximize the commercial potential of our ultra-rapid-acting insulin product candidates, we will likely depend on one or more manufacturers of insulin pen injection devices or syringes to supply us with a commercially acceptable device. To date, we have not entered into any agreements for the supply of insulin pen injection devices or syringes, and we cannot assure you that any such devices will be available on terms that will be acceptable to us, if at all.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily, including failing to meet established timelines for the completion of such trials.\nWe do not independently conduct clinical trials of our product candidates. We rely on third parties, such as contract research organizations, clinical data management organizations, medical institutions and clinical investigators, to enroll qualified patients and conduct our clinical trials. Our reliance on these third parties for clinical development activities reduces our control over these activities. We are responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trial. Moreover, the FDA requires us to comply with standards, commonly referred to as Good Clinical Practices, for conducting, recording, and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of trial participants are protected. Our reliance on third parties that we do not control does not relieve us of these responsibilities and requirements. Furthermore, these third parties may also have relationships with other entities, some of which may be our competitors. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, meet expected deadlines or conduct our clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated protocols, we will not be able to obtain, or may be delayed in obtaining, regulatory approvals for our product candidates and will not be able to, or may be delayed in our efforts to, successfully commercialize our product candidates.\nIf our suppliers of active pharmaceutical ingredients and other production materials fail to deliver materials and provide services needed for the production of our product candidates in a timely and sufficient manner, or if they fail to comply with applicable regulations, clinical development or regulatory approval of our product candidates, commercialization of our products could be delayed, producing additional losses and depriving us of potential product revenue.\nWe need access to sufficient, reliable and affordable supplies of insulin, glucagon and other materials, such as vials, cartridges, prefilled syringes and, potentially, drug injection devices, for which we rely on various suppliers. We also must rely on those suppliers to comply with relevant regulatory and other legal requirements, including the production of insulin and glucagon in accordance with cGMP. We can make no assurances that our suppliers will comply with cGMP.\nWe have entered into a commercial supply agreement with Bachem AG for the supply of all of the glucagon we will need for the testing and manufacturing of our GEM product candidate. The initial term of our agreement with Bachem AG will expire in July 2017. We believe that the quantities of glucagon that we have rights to acquire under this agreement will be sufficient to allow us to complete our current and anticipated future clinical trials of our GEM product candidate and to support any potential commercial launch of the product candidate.\nWe have terminated an earlier supply agreement with N.V. Organon (subsequently acquired by Amphastar Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a specialty pharmaceutical development and manufacturing company), under which we have purchased the RHI we have used to formulate all of our RHI-based product candidates. We intend to use existing supplies of RHI to support the further development of BIOD-531, as well as enter into one or more development stage RHI supply agreements, as necessary. We do not have any plans, however, to commit to quantities of RHI that may be required to support the potential commercial launch of one or more of our RHI-based product candidates.\nIf we are unable to procure sufficient quantities of glucagon or insulin from our current or any future supplier, if supply of RHI, glucagon and other materials otherwise becomes limited, or if our suppliers do not meet relevant regulatory requirements, and if we were unable to obtain these materials in sufficient amounts, in a timely manner and at reasonable prices, we could be delayed in the manufacturing and possible commercialization of our product candidates, which may have a material adverse effect on our business. We would incur substantial costs and manufacturing delays if our suppliers are unable to provide us with products or services approved by the FDA or other regulatory agencies.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, our competitors may develop and market similar or identical products that may reduce demand for our products, and we may be prevented from establishing collaborative relationships on favorable terms.\nThe following factors are important to our success:\n\u2022receiving patent protection for our product candidates;\n\u2022maintaining our trade secrets;\n\u2022not infringing on the proprietary rights of others; and\n\u2022preventing others from infringing on our proprietary rights.\nWe will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary rights are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets. We try to protect our proprietary position by filing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development of our business. Because the patent position of pharmaceutical companies involves complex legal and factual questions, the issuance, scope and enforceability of patents cannot be predicted with certainty. Patents, if issued, may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. Thus, any patents that we own or license from others may not provide any protection against competitors.\nOur pending patent applications, those we may file in the future, or those we may license from third parties, may not result in patents being issued. If patents do not issue with claims encompassing our products, our competitors may develop and market similar or identical products that compete with ours. Even if patents are issued, they may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Failure to obtain effective patent protection for our technology and products may reduce demand for our products and prevent us from establishing collaborative relationships on favorable terms.\nThe individual active and inactive ingredients in our ultra-rapid-acting insulin formulations and our stable glucagon presentations have been known and used for many years and, therefore, are no longer subject to patent protection, except in proprietary combinations. Accordingly, our patent and pending applications are directed to the particular formulations of these ingredients in our products, and to their use. Although we\nbelieve our formulations and their uses are or will be patented and provide a competitive advantage, our patents may not prevent others from marketing formulations using the same active and inactive ingredients in different combinations.\nWe also rely on trade secrets, know-how and technology, which are not protected by patents, to maintain our competitive position. We try to protect this information by entering into confidentiality agreements with parties that have access to it, such as potential corporate partners, collaborators, employees and consultants. Any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our confidential information or our competitors may learn of the information in some other way. Furthermore, others may independently develop similar technologies or duplicate any technology that we have developed. If any trade secret, know-how or other technology not protected by a patent were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our business and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nThe laws of many foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Accordingly, the fact that we have obtained certain patent rights in the United States does not guarantee that we will be able to obtain the same or similar rights elsewhere. Even if we are granted patents in foreign countries, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to enforce our rights effectively.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits and administrative proceedings to protect, defend or enforce our patents that would be expensive and time-consuming.\nIn order to protect or enforce our patent rights, we may initiate patent litigation against third parties in the United States or in foreign countries. In addition, we may be subject to certain opposition proceedings conducted in patent and trademark offices challenging the validity of our patents and may become involved in future opposition proceedings challenging the patents of others. For example, in late July 2013, a third party initiated administrative proceedings to oppose two of our more recent patents that have been granted by the European Patent Office in connection with our ultra-rapid-acting insulin formulations. While we were successful in defending the opposition before the Opposition Division of the European Patent Office in October 2014, the decision in those proceedings has been appealed. The defense of intellectual property rights, including patent rights, through lawsuits, interference or opposition proceedings, and other legal and administrative proceedings can be costly and can divert our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. Such costs increase our operating losses and reduce our resources available for development activities. An adverse determination of any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing.\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. For example, during the course of this kind of litigation and despite protective orders entered by the court, confidential information may be inadvertently disclosed in the form of documents or testimony in connection with discovery requests, depositions or trial testimony. This disclosure could materially adversely affect our business and financial results.\nClaims by other parties that we infringe or have misappropriated their proprietary technology may result in liability for damages, royalties, or other payments, or stop our development and commercialization efforts.\nCompetitors and other third parties may initiate patent litigation against us in the United States or in foreign countries based on existing patents or patents that may be granted in the future. Many of our competitors may have obtained patents covering products and processes generally related to our products and processes, and they may assert these patents against us. Moreover, there can be no assurance that these competitors have not sought or will not seek additional patents that may cover aspects of our technology. As a result, there is a greater likelihood of a patent dispute than would be expected if our competitors were pursuing unrelated technologies.\nWhile we conduct patent searches to determine whether the technologies used in our products infringe patents held by third parties, numerous patent applications are currently pending and may be filed in the future for technologies generally related to our technologies, including many patent applications that remain\nconfidential after filing. Due to these factors and the inherent uncertainty in conducting patent searches, there can be no guarantee that we will not violate third-party patent rights that we have not yet identified.\nThere may be U.S. and foreign patents issued to third parties that relate to aspects of our product candidates. There may also be patent applications filed by these or other parties in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions that relate to some aspects of our product candidates, which, if issued, could subject us to infringement actions. The owners or licensees of these and other patents may file one or more infringement actions against us. In addition, a competitor may claim misappropriation of a trade secret by an employee hired from that competitor. Any such infringement or misappropriation action could cause us to incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit and could distract our management from our business, even if the allegations of infringement or misappropriation are unwarranted. A need to defend multiple actions or claims could have a disproportionately greater impact. In addition, either in response to or in anticipation of any such infringement or misappropriation claim, we may enter into commercial agreements with the owners or licensees of these rights. The terms of these commercial agreements may include substantial payments, including substantial royalty payments on revenues received by us in connection with the commercialization of our products.\nPayments under such agreements could increase our operating losses and reduce our resources available for development activities. Furthermore, a party making this type of claim could secure a judgment that requires us to pay substantial damages, which would increase our operating losses and reduce our resources available for development activities. A judgment could also include an injunction or other court order that could prevent us from making, using, selling, offering for sale or importing our products or prevent our customers from using our products. If a court determined or if we independently concluded that any of our products or manufacturing processes violated third-party proprietary rights, our clinical trials could be delayed and there can be no assurance that we would be able to reengineer the product or processes to avoid those rights, or to obtain a license under those rights on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Approval of Our Product Candidates\nIf the FDA does not believe that our product candidates satisfy the requirements for the Section 505(b)(2) approval procedure, or if the requirements for our product candidates under Section 505(b)(2) are not as we expect, the approval pathway will take longer and cost more than anticipated and in either case may not be successful.\nWe believe our ultra-rapid-acting insulin formulations and our stable glucagon presentation for use as a rescue product qualify for approval under Section 505(b)(2) of the FFDCA. Because we are developing new formulations of previously approved chemical entities, such as insulin and glucagon, our drug approval strategy is to submit Section 505(b)(2) NDAs to the FDA. We plan to pursue similar routes for submitting applications for our product candidates in foreign jurisdictions if available. The FDA may not agree that our product candidates are approvable pursuant to Section 505(b)(2) NDAs. There is no specific guidance available for Section 505(b)(2) NDAs for insulin or glucagon. In addition, while there is precedent for a glucagon product being approved under a Section 505(b)(2) NDA, we are not aware of any insulin product that has been approved under a Section 505(b)(2) NDA. If the FDA determines that Section 505(b)(2) NDAs are not appropriate and that full NDAs are required for our product candidates, the time and financial resources required to obtain FDA approval for our product candidates could substantially and materially increase, and our product candidates might be less likely to be approved. If the FDA requires full NDAs for our product candidates, or requires more extensive testing and development for some other reason, our ability to compete with alternative products that arrive on the market more quickly than our product candidates would be adversely impacted.\nNotwithstanding the approval of many products by the FDA pursuant to Section 505(b)(2), over the last few years certain pharmaceutical companies and others have objected to the FDA's interpretation of Section 505(b)(2). If the FDA's interpretation of Section 505(b)(2) is successfully challenged in court, the FDA may be required to change its interpretation of Section 505(b)(2) which could delay or even prevent the FDA from approving any Section 505(b)(2) NDA that we submit. The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive, and it is not uncommon for a manufacturer of an approved product to file a citizen petition with the FDA seeking to delay approval of, or impose additional approval requirements for, pending competing products. If\nsuccessful, such petitions can significantly delay, or even prevent, the approval of the new product. Moreover, even if the FDA ultimately denies such a petition, the FDA may substantially delay approval while it considers and responds to the petition.\nEven if one of our product candidates is approved under Section 505(b)(2), the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to other conditions of approval, or may contain requirements for costly post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product.\nAny product for which we obtain marketing approval could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we experience unanticipated problems with our products, when and if any of them are approved.\nAny product for which we obtain marketing approval, along with the manufacturing processes, post-approval clinical data, labeling, advertising and promotional activities for such product, will be subject to continual requirements of and review by the FDA and other state and federal regulatory authorities. These requirements include, in the case of the FDA, submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration requirements, cGMP requirements relating to quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, requirements regarding the distribution of samples to physicians and recordkeeping. Even if regulatory approval of a product is granted, the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to other conditions of approval, or may contain requirements for costly post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product. In addition, if any of our product candidates are approved, our product labeling, advertising and promotion would be subject to regulatory requirements and continuing regulatory review. The FDA strictly regulates the promotional claims that may be made about prescription drug products. In particular, a drug may not be promoted in a misleading manner or for uses that are not approved by the FDA as reflected in the product's approved labeling. The FDA and other state and federal entities actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting misleading promotion and the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.\nDiscovery after approval of previously unknown problems with our products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with state or federal regulatory requirements, may result in actions such as:\n\u2022restrictions on such products' manufacturers or manufacturing processes;\n\u2022restrictions on the marketing or distribution of a product;\n\u2022requirements that we conduct new studies, make labeling changes, and implement Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies;\n\u2022warning letters;\n\u2022withdrawal of the products from the market;\n\u2022refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit;\n\u2022recall of products;\n\u2022fines, restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenue;\n\u2022suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals;\n\u2022refusal to permit the import or export of our products;\n\u2022product embargo and/or seizure;\n\u2022injunctions; or\n\u2022imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nChanges in law, regulations, and policies may preclude approval of our product under a 505(b)(2) or make it more difficult and costly for us to obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates and to produce, market and distribute our existing products.\nIn March 2010, the President signed into law legislation creating an abbreviated pathway for approval under the Public Health Service, or PHS Act, of biological products that are similar to other biological products that are approved under the PHS Act. This legislation also expanded the definition of biological product to include proteins such as insulin. The new law contains transitional provisions governing protein products such as insulin that, under certain circumstances, might permit companies to seek approval for their insulin products as biologics under the PHS Act and might require that Biodel's product be approved under the PHS Act rather than in a 505(b)(2) NDA. We would be unlikely to pursue approval of our product candidates if we were required to seek approval under the PHS Act rather than in a 505(b)(2) NDA.\nIn addition, the federal and state laws, regulations, policies or guidance may change in a manner that could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates or further restrict or regulate post-approval activities. It is impossible to predict whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations implemented or modified, or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.\nFailure to obtain regulatory approval in international jurisdictions would prevent us from marketing our products abroad.\nWe intend to have our products marketed outside the United States. In order to market our products in the European Union and many other jurisdictions, we must obtain separate regulatory approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products. The approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing. The time required to obtain approval may differ from that required to obtain FDA approval. The regulatory approval processes outside the United States may include all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval, as well as additional risks. In addition, in many countries outside the United States, it is required that the product be approved for reimbursement before the product can be approved for sale in that country. We may not obtain approvals from regulatory authorities outside the United States on a timely basis, if at all. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions, and approval by one regulatory authority outside the United States does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions or by the FDA. We may not be able to file for regulatory approvals and may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our products in any market.\nReports of side effects or safety concerns in related technology fields or in other companies' clinical trials could delay or prevent us from obtaining regulatory approval or negatively impact public perception of our product candidates.\nAt present, there are a number of clinical trials being conducted by us and by other pharmaceutical companies involving insulin or insulin delivery systems. The major safety concern with patients taking insulin is the occurrence of hypoglycemic events. If we discover that our product is associated with a significantly increased frequency of hypoglycemic or other adverse events, or if other pharmaceutical companies announce that they observed frequent or significant adverse events in their trials involving insulin or insulin delivery systems, we could encounter delays in the commencement or completion of our clinical trials or difficulties in obtaining the approval of our product candidates. In addition, the public perception of our products might be adversely affected, which could harm our business and results of operations, even if the concern relates to another company's product.\nRisks Related to Employee Matters and Managing Growth\nOur future success depends on our ability to retain our chief executive officer and other key executives and to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.\nWe are highly dependent on Errol De Souza, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Gary Gemignani, our Chief Financial Officer. The loss of the services of any of these persons might impede the achievement of our research, development and commercialization objectives. Replacing key employees may be\ndifficult and time-consuming because of the limited number of individuals in our industry with the skills and experiences required to develop, gain regulatory approval of and commercialize our product candidates successfully. We generally do not maintain key person life insurance to cover the loss of any of our employees.\nRecruiting and retaining qualified scientific personnel, clinical personnel and sales and marketing personnel will also be critical to our success. We may not be able to attract and retain these personnel on acceptable terms, if at all, given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for similar personnel. We also experience competition for the hiring of scientific and clinical personnel from other companies, universities and research institutions. In addition, we rely on consultants and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, to assist us in formulating our research and development and commercialization strategy. Our consultants and advisors may be employed by employers other than us and may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit their availability to us.\nWe may expand our development, regulatory and sales and marketing capabilities, and as a result, we may encounter difficulties in managing our growth, which could disrupt our operations.\nIf our development and commercialization plans for any of our product candidates are successful, we may experience significant growth in the number of our employees and the scope of our operations, particularly in the areas of manufacturing, clinical trials management, and regulatory affairs. To manage our possible future growth, we must continue to implement and improve our managerial, operational and financial systems and continue to recruit and train additional qualified personnel. Due to our limited financial resources we may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations or recruit and train additional qualified personnel. Any inability to manage growth could delay the execution of our business plans or disrupt our operations.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur strategic alternatives process may not result in a successful corporate transaction or liquidity event.\nWe have previously announced that our Board of Directors has approved a plan to explore our strategic alternatives. Any process of exploring strategic alternatives includes market risk and other uncertainties. There can be no assurance that the aforementioned exploration of strategic alternatives will result in the successful consummation of a liquidity event or other corporate transaction, on a basis that will provide any specific level of value to our common stockholders or other security holders, or at all. We do not currently have an investment bank formally engaged with respect to the strategic alternatives process, however, our plan is to engage an investment banking firm with respect to such an engagement.\nOur failure to meet continued listing compliance criteria in accordance with Nasdaq Stock Market rules could result in Nasdaq delisting our common stock.\nNasdaq Stock Market listing rules require us to maintain certain closing bid price, stockholders equity, and other financial metric criteria. On September 21, 2015, we received a written notice from the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC, or NASDAQ, indicating that we were not in compliance with the minimum bid price requirement set forth in Nasdaq Rules for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market. Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) requires listed securities to maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share, and Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A) provides that a failure to meet the minimum bid price requirement exists if the deficiency continues for a period of 30 consecutive business days. Based on the closing bid price of our common stock for the 30 consecutive business days from August 6, 2015 to September 16, 2015, we no longer meet the minimum bid price requirement.\nPursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we have been granted a 180 calendar day compliance period, or until March 21, 2016, to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. During the compliance period, our common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market. To regain compliance, the closing bid of our common stock must meet or exceed $1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days during the 180 calendar day grace period. In the event we are not in compliance by March 21, 2016, we may be afforded a second 180 calendar day grace period. To qualify, we would be required to meet the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and all other initial listing standards for the Nasdaq Capital Market, with the exception of the minimum bid price requirement. In addition, we would be required to provide written notice of our intention to cure the minimum bid price deficiency by effecting a reverse stock split, if necessary. There can be no assurance that we will be able to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement or will otherwise be in compliance with other NASDAQ listing criteria.\nIn the event that we were delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market, our common stock would become significantly less liquid, which would likely adversely affect its value. Although our common stock would likely be traded over-the-counter or on other less liquid trading platforms, these types of listings involve more risk and trade less frequently and in smaller volumes than securities traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market.\nProvisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our corporate charter and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control of us that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors. Because our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions could in turn affect any attempt by our stockholders to replace current members of our management team.\nAmong others, these provisions:\n\u2022establish a classified board of directors such that not all members of the board are elected at one time;\n\u2022allow the authorized number of our directors to be changed only by resolution of our board of directors;\n\u2022limit the manner in which stockholders can remove directors from the board;\n\u2022establish advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals that can be acted on at stockholder meetings and nominations to our board of directors;\n\u2022require that stockholder actions must be effected at a duly called stockholder meeting and prohibit actions by our stockholders by written consent;\n\u2022limit who may call stockholder meetings;\n\u2022authorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could be used to institute a stockholder rights plan or \"poison pill\" that would work to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, effectively preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our board of directors; and\n\u2022require the approval of the holders of at least 75% of the votes that all our stockholders would be entitled to cast to amend or repeal certain provisions of our charter or bylaws.\nIn addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits a person who owns in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nBecause our stock price is volatile, purchasers of our common stock could incur substantial losses.\nOur stock price has been and may continue to be volatile. The stock market in general and the market for biotechnology companies in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:\n\u2022results of clinical trials of our product candidates or those of our competitors;\n\u2022regulatory or legal developments in the United States and other countries;\n\u2022variations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u2022developments or disputes concerning patents or other proprietary rights;\n\u2022the recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u2022changes in the structure of healthcare payment systems;\n\u2022market conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors and issuance of new or changed securities analysts' reports or recommendations;\n\u2022general economic, industry and market conditions; and\n\u2022the other factors described in this \"Risk Factors\" section.\nOur outstanding warrants may be exercised, and our outstanding shares of preferred stock may be converted, in the future, which would increase the number of shares in the public market and result in dilution to our stockholders.\nAs a result of our May 2011 registered direct offering and June 2012 private placement, we have outstanding warrants to purchase 2,256,929 shares of our common stock at $9.92 per share and 2,749,469 shares of our common stock at $2.66 per share. The $9.92 per share warrants expire in May 2016 and the $2.66 per share warrants expire in June 2017. We also have outstanding shares of Series B preferred stock that are convertible into 1,909,410 shares of common stock. The exercise of these warrants for, or the conversion of shares of Series B preferred stock into, shares of common stock would be substantially dilutive to the outstanding shares of common stock. Any dilution or potential dilution may cause our stockholders to sell their shares, which would contribute to a downward movement in the stock price of our common stock.\nWe have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have paid no cash dividends on our common stock to date. We currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. In addition, the terms of any future debt agreements may preclude us from paying dividends. As a result, we do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future, and payment of cash dividends, if any, will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements and other factors and will be at the discretion of our board of directors. Furthermore, we may in the future become subject to contractual restrictions on, or prohibitions against, the payment of dividends. Capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be investors' sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\nWe incur substantial costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management is required to devote substantial time to comply with public company regulations.\nWe are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 as well as other federal and state laws. These requirements may place a strain on our people, systems and resources. The Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting. In order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting, significant resources and management oversight are required. This may divert management's attention from other business concerns, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.", "PERMNO": 92032, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "ALBO"}
