{"cik": "1348036", "company": "AVALARA, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-24", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nYou should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and related notes, before making an investment decision. If any of the events or circumstances described in the following risk factors actually occurs, our business, operating results, financial condition, cash flows, and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Industry\nWe have incurred significant operating losses in the past and may never achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe have incurred significant operating losses since our inception, including net losses of $125.2 million, $49.2 million, and $50.2 million in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. We had an accumulated deficit of $684.6 million as of December 31, 2021. We expect our operating expenses to continue to increase in future periods as we hire additional sales and other personnel, improve the Avalara Compliance Cloud, invest in sales and marketing initiatives, expand our international reach, and potentially acquire complementary technology and businesses. If our revenue does not increase to offset increases in our operating expenses, we may never achieve or maintain profitability. Revenue growth may slow, revenue may decline, or we may incur significant losses in the future for a number of possible reasons, including slowing demand for our solutions, increasing competition, a decrease or slowing in the growth of the markets in which we compete, or if we fail for any reason to capitalize on growth opportunities. If these losses exceed our expectations or if our revenue growth expectations are not met in future periods, our financial performance will be harmed.\nOur revenue growth rate may not be sustainable.\nOur revenue has grown rapidly, from $382.4 million in 2019, and $500.6 million in 2020 to $699.0 million in 2021. As our revenue base grows, we expect that our revenue growth rate will decline over time, and you should not rely on the revenue growth rate of any prior period as an indication of our future performance. This risk may increase with any future acquisition, particularly if the revenue growth rate of the acquired business has been lower than ours.\nOur revenue growth rate depends on existing customers renewing and maintaining or upgrading their subscriptions, and if we fail to retain our customers at current or upgraded subscriptions, our business will be harmed.\nOur customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our solutions after the expiration of their subscription periods. Our customers may not renew subscriptions for a similar mix of solutions or transaction volumes. Our renewal rates may decline because of a number of factors, including customer dissatisfaction, customers\u2019 spending levels, decreased transaction volumes, increased competition, changes in tax laws or rules, pricing changes, or legislative changes affecting tax compliance providers. If our customers do not renew their subscriptions or reduce the solutions or transaction volumes purchased under their subscriptions, our revenue may decline and our business may be harmed. Our future success also depends in part on existing customers upgrading their subscriptions. If our efforts to sell upgrades to our customers are not successful, it may decrease our revenue growth rate.\nIf we are unable to attract new customers on a cost-effective basis, our business will be harmed.\nTo grow our business, we must continue to grow our customer base in a cost-effective manner. Increasing our customer base and achieving broader market acceptance of our solutions will depend, to a significant extent, on our ability to effectively expand our sales and marketing activities. We may not be able to recruit qualified personnel, train them to perform, and achieve an acceptable level of sales production from them on a timely basis or at all. In addition, the cost to attract new customers may increase as we market our existing and new solutions to different market segments and geographies. If we are unable to maintain effective sales and marketing activities and maintain and expand our partner network, our ability to attract new customers could be harmed, our sales and marketing expenses could increase substantially, and our business, results of operations, and financial condition may suffer.\nIf we fail to effectively manage our growth, our business, results of operations, and financial condition would likely be harmed.\nWe expect to continue to experience rapid growth in our headcount and operations, domestically and internationally, which will continue to place significant demands on our management and our administrative, operational, and financial reporting resources. We have experienced significant growth in the number of customers, number of transactions, and the amount of content we support. Our growth will require hiring additional employees\nand making significant expenditures, particularly in sales and marketing but also in our technology, professional services, finance, and administration teams, as well as facilities and infrastructure. Our ability to effectively manage our growth will require the allocation of management and employee resources along with improvements to operational and financial controls and reporting procedures and systems. In addition, as we continue to expand internationally, we will encounter unexpected challenges and expenses due to unfamiliarity with local requirements, practices, and markets. Our expenses may increase more than we plan, and we may fail to hire qualified personnel, expand our customer base, enhance our existing solutions, develop new solutions, integrate any acquisitions, satisfy the requirements of our existing customers, respond to competitive challenges, or otherwise execute our strategies. If we are unable to effectively manage our growth, our business, results of operations, and financial condition would likely be harmed.\nIf we fail to attract and retain qualified personnel, our business could be harmed.\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to attract, integrate, motivate, and retain highly qualified personnel at a reasonable cost on the terms we desire, particularly sales and marketing personnel, software developers, technical support, and research and development personnel. Competition for skilled personnel, particularly in the technology industry and in some countries and regions in which we operate, is intense and we may not be successful in attracting, motivating, and retaining needed personnel. We also may be unable to attract or integrate into our operations qualified personnel on the schedule we desire. We have from time to time experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in attracting, integrating, motivating, and retaining highly qualified personnel, which could harm our business. In addition, dealing with the loss of the services of our executive officers, including our chief executive officer, or other key personnel and the process to replace any of our executive officers or key personnel may involve significant time and expense, take longer than anticipated, and significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives, which would harm our financial condition, results of operations, and business.\nRevenue received as a certified provider in the Streamlined Sales Tax program is subject to price negotiations, and any decrease in payment rates or discontinuation of the program could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and growth prospects.\nWe currently derive and, at least in the near term, expect to continue to derive significant revenue as a certified provider in the SST program. SST payment rates are subject to price negotiations with the SST Governing Board and its member states. For example, effective January 2021, SST payment rates decreased under a new contract with the SST Governing Board. If SST payment rates were to decrease further or if the SST program were to be discontinued, our business, results of operations, financial condition, and growth prospects will suffer.\nWe may not successfully develop or introduce new and enhanced solutions that achieve market acceptance, or successfully integrate acquired products, services, or content with our existing solutions, and our business could be harmed and our revenue could suffer as a result.\nOur ability to attract new customers and increase revenue from existing customers will likely depend upon the successful development, introduction, and customer acceptance of new and enhanced versions of our solutions and on our ability to integrate any products, services, and content that we may acquire. Moreover, if we are unable to expand our solutions, our customers could migrate to competitors. Our business could be harmed if we fail to deliver new versions, upgrades, or other enhancements to our existing solutions to meet customer needs on a timely and cost-effective basis. Unexpected delays in releasing new or enhanced versions of our solutions, or errors following their release, could result in loss of sales, delay in market acceptance, or customer claims against us, any of which could harm our business. The success of any new solution depends on several factors, including timely completion, adequate quality testing, and market acceptance. We may not be able to develop new solutions successfully or to introduce and gain market acceptance of new solutions in a timely manner, or at all. Additionally, we must continually modify and enhance our solutions to keep pace with changes in hardware systems and software applications, database technology, and evolving technical standards and interfaces. As a result, uncertainties related to the timing and nature of business application providers, announcements or introductions of new solutions, or modifications by vendors of existing hardware systems or back-office or internet-related software applications, could harm our business and cause our revenue to decline.\nOur business and success depend in part on our strategic relationships with third parties, including our partner ecosystem, and our business would be harmed if we fail to maintain or expand these relationships.\nWe depend on, and anticipate we will continue to depend on, various third-party relationships to sustain and grow our business. We are highly dependent on relationships with third-party publishers of software business applications, particularly our largest partners, because the integration of our solutions with their applications allows us to reach their large customer bases. Our sales and our customers\u2019 user experience are dependent on our ability to connect easily to such third-party software applications. We may fail to retain and expand these integrations or relationships for many reasons, including due to third parties\u2019 failure to maintain, support, or secure their technology platforms in general and our integrations in particular. Any such failure could harm our relationship with our customers, our reputation and brand, and our business and results of operations.\nAs we seek to add different types of partners to our partner ecosystem, it is uncertain whether these third parties will be successful in building integrations, co-marketing our solutions to provide a significant volume and quality of lead referrals and orders, or continuing to work with us as their own products evolve. Identifying and negotiating new and expanded partner relationships requires significant resources. In addition, integrating third-party technology can be complex, costly, and time-consuming. Third parties may be unwilling to build integrations, and we may be required to devote additional resources to develop integrations for business applications on our own. The contracts applicable to third parties\u2019 development tools may be unfavorable and add costs or risks to our business or may require us to push additional contract terms to our customers that affect our relationship with our customers. Providers of business applications with which we have integrations may decide to compete with us or enter into arrangements with our competitors, which may result in such providers offering multiple solutions on their applications or withdrawing support for our integrations. In addition, any failure of our solutions to operate effectively with business applications could reduce the demand for our solutions and harm to our business. If we are unable to respond to these changes or failures in a cost-effective manner, our solutions may become less marketable, less competitive, or obsolete, and our results of operations may be negatively impacted.\nIn addition, we leverage the sales and referral resources of our partners through a variety of incentive programs. In the event that we are unable to effectively utilize, maintain, and expand these relationships, our revenue growth would slow, we would need to devote additional resources to the development, sales, and marketing of our solutions, and our financial results and future growth prospects would be harmed. Additionally, our partners may demand, or demand greater, referral fees or commissions. Certain large partners may negotiate, and in the past have negotiated, lower fees that may be charged to their end customers.\nOur acquisitions of, and investments in, other businesses, products, or technologies may not yield expected benefits and our inability to successfully integrate acquisitions may negatively impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn the past, we have pursued acquisitions of content, technology, and expertise to enhance the transaction tax compliance products and services we offer. We anticipate that we will continue to make acquisitions of or investments in businesses, products, content, and technologies in the future. We may not realize the anticipated benefits, or any benefits, from our past or future acquisitions. In addition, if we finance acquisitions by incurring debt or by issuing equity or convertible or other debt securities, our existing shareholders may be diluted or we could face constraints related to the repayment of indebtedness. To the extent that the acquisition consideration is paid in the form of an earnout on future financial results, the success of such an acquisition will not be fully realized by us for a period of time as it is shared with the sellers. Further, if we fail to properly evaluate and execute acquisitions or investments, our business and prospects may be seriously harmed and the value of your investment may decline. For us to realize the benefits of past and future acquisitions, we must successfully integrate the acquired businesses, products, or technologies with ours. Some of the challenges to successful integration of our acquisitions include:\n\u2022\nunanticipated costs or liabilities resulting from our acquisitions;\n\u2022\nretention of key employees from acquired businesses;\n\u2022\ndifficulties integrating acquired operations, personnel, technologies, products, or content, which may be more significant in the case of foreign acquisitions;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management attention from existing business operations and strategy;\n\u2022\ndiversion of resources that are needed in other parts of our business, including integration of other acquisitions;\n\u2022\npotential write-offs of acquired assets;\n\u2022\ninability to maintain relationships with customers and partners of the acquired business;\n\u2022\ndifficulty of transitioning acquired technology and related infrastructures onto our existing platform;\n\u2022\ndifficulty maintaining security and privacy standards of acquired technology consistent with our existing solutions;\n\u2022\npotential financial and credit risks associated with the acquired business or customers;\n\u2022\nthe need to implement internal controls, procedures, and policies at the acquired company;\n\u2022\nthe need to comply with additional laws and regulations applicable to the acquired business; and\n\u2022\nthe income and indirect tax impacts of any such acquisitions.\nOur failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or investments and negatively impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf we fail to compete effectively, our revenue growth could be negatively affected.\nWe face significant competitive challenges from do-it-yourself approaches, outsourced transaction tax compliance services offered by accounting and specialized consulting firms, and other tax-specific software vendors. Many businesses using do-it-yourself approaches believe that manual processes are adequate and may be unwilling to pay the costs of our solutions, resulting in an inertia that can be difficult to overcome.\nThere are a number of competing tax-specific software vendors. Many of our competitors, as well as large accounting firms, have historically targeted primarily large enterprise customers, but also may market to small to medium-sized businesses. Other competitors who currently focus on small to medium-sized businesses may be better positioned than larger competitors to increase their market share with such businesses by competing on price, service, or otherwise. We also face competition from private transaction tax compliance businesses focused primarily on ecommerce. It is also possible that enterprises operating in adjacent compliance, financial services, or ecommerce verticals may decide to pursue transaction tax compliance and become significant competitors. Increased competition may impact our ability to add new customers at the rates we have historically achieved. Our failure to successfully and effectively compete with current or future competitors could lead to lost business and negatively affect our revenue growth.\nWe face significant risks in selling our solutions to enterprise customers, and if we do not manage these efforts effectively, our results of operations and ability to grow our customer base could be harmed.\nSales to enterprise customers typically involve higher customer acquisition costs and longer sales cycles. The historical sales cycle and conversion rate trends associated with our existing mid-market customers may not apply to larger enterprise businesses for whom purchasing decisions may require the approval of more technical personnel and management levels. Larger customers may demand more integration services and customization as well as different product features and ongoing service expectations. In addition, our standard pricing model may be less attractive to certain customers with very high volumes of transactions. As a result, sales opportunities to larger businesses may require us to devote greater research and development, sales, support, and professional services resources to individual prospective customers, resulting in increased acquisition costs and strains on our limited resources. Moreover, these larger transactions may require us to delay recognizing the associated revenue we derive from these prospective customers until all revenue requirements have been met.\nOur quarterly and annual results of operations are likely to fluctuate in future periods.\nWe expect to experience quarterly or annual fluctuations in our results of operations due to a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control. This makes our future results difficult to predict and could cause our results of operations to fall below expectations or our predictions. The other risk factors discussed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section may contribute to the variability of our quarterly and annual results. In addition, a percentage of our operating expenses is fixed in nature and is planned based on forecasted financial performance. In the event of revenue shortfalls, we may not be able to mitigate the negative impact on our results of operations quickly enough to avoid short-term impacts.\nBecause we recognize revenue from subscriptions for our solutions over the terms of the subscriptions, our financial results in any period may not be indicative of our financial health and future performance.\nWe generally recognize revenue from subscription fees paid by customers ratably over the terms of their subscription agreements. As a result, most of the subscription revenue we report in each quarter is the result of agreements entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any one quarter will not be fully reflected in our revenue results for that quarter. Any such decline, however, will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. Our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as subscription revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription terms.\nIf we make errors in our customers\u2019 transaction tax determinations or when completing our customers\u2019 returns or remit their tax payments late or not at all, our reputation, results of operations, and growth prospects could suffer.\nThe tax determination functions we perform for customers are complicated, time-sensitive, and dependent on the accuracy of the database of tax content underlying our solutions. Some of our processes are not fully automated, such as our process for monitoring updates to tax rates and rules, and, even to the extent our processes are automated, our solutions are not proven to be without possibility of errors. If we make errors in our customers\u2019 tax determinations or when completing our customers\u2019 returns or remit their tax payments late or not at all, our customers may be assessed for underpayment of taxes, along with interest and penalties. In addition, as a certified provider in the SST program, in some circumstances we may become liable to member states in the event of delinquent payment of taxes and may be responsible for certain tax liabilities. For certain of our solutions, we guarantee the accuracy or timeliness of the results or output provided by those solutions and could be liable under such guarantee for up to 12 months\u2019 service fees for those solutions in the event of an error that results in uncollected or unremitted taxes, penalties, or interest. Although our agreements have disclaimers of warranties and limit our liability (beyond the amounts we agree to pay pursuant to our guarantee, if applicable), a court could determine that such disclaimers and limitations are unenforceable as a matter of law and hold us liable for these errors. Further, in some instances we have negotiated agreements with specific customers or assumed agreements in connection with our acquisitions that do not limit this liability or disclaim these warranties. Additionally, erroneous tax determinations could result in overpayments to taxing authorities that may be difficult to reclaim from the applicable taxing authorities. Any history of erroneous tax determinations or returns or failures to timely remit tax payments for our customers could also cause our reputation to be harmed, could result in negative publicity, loss of or delay in market acceptance of our solutions, loss of customer renewals, and loss of competitive position. In addition, our errors and omissions insurance coverage may not cover all amounts claimed against us if such errors or failures occur. The financial and reputational costs associated with any erroneous tax determinations or failures to timely remit tax payments may be substantial and could harm our results of operations and financial condition.\nCybersecurity and data security breaches and ransomware attacks may create financial liabilities for us, damage our reputation, and harm our business.\nOur customers provide us with information that our solutions store, some of which is confidential information about them or their financial transactions, as well as significant amounts of money for remittance to various taxing jurisdictions on their behalf. In addition, we store personal information about our employees and, to a lesser extent, those who purchase products or services from our customers. We have security systems and information technology infrastructure designed to protect against unauthorized access to such information and money, but we may not be successful in protecting against all security breaches and cyber-attacks. Threats to and breaches of our information technology security can take various forms, including viruses, worms, ransomware, and other malicious software\nprograms, or actions or omissions by an employee. Significant cybersecurity or data security breaches could result in the loss of business, litigation, regulatory investigations, loss of customers, and penalties that could damage our reputation and adversely affect the growth of our business.\nIn some cases, we must rely on the safeguards put in place by third parties to protect against security threats. These third parties, including vendors that provide products and services for our operations and our network of business application providers, could also be a source of security risk to us in the event of a failure of their own security systems and infrastructure, whether unintentionally or through a malicious backdoor. We do not review the software code included in third-party integrations in all instances.\nBecause the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, sabotage systems, or otherwise access data and/or data backups change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we or these third parties have been and, in the future, may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. With the increasing frequency of cyber-related frauds to obtain inappropriate payments, we need to ensure our internal controls related to authorizing the transfer of funds are adequate. We may also be required to expend resources to remediate cyber-related incidents or to enhance and strengthen our cyber security. Any of these occurrences could create liability for us, put our reputation in jeopardy, and harm our business.\nOur platform, solutions, and internal systems, as well as external internet infrastructure, may be subject to disruption that could harm our reputation and future sales or result in claims against us.\nBecause our operations involve delivering a suite of transaction tax compliance solutions to our customers through a cloud-based software platform, our continued growth depends in part on the ability of our platform and related computer equipment, third-party data centers, infrastructure, and systems to continue to support our solutions. In addition, in delivering our solutions to customers, we are reliant on internet infrastructure limitations. In the past, we have experienced temporary and limited platform disruptions, outages in our solutions, and degraded levels of performance due to human and software errors, file corruption, and first and third-party capacity constraints associated with the number of customers accessing our platform simultaneously. While our past experiences have not materially impacted us, in the future we may face more extensive disruptions, outages, or performance problems. In addition, malicious third parties may also conduct attacks designed to sabotage our platform, impede the performance of our solutions, or temporarily deny customers access to our solutions. If an actual or perceived disruption, outage, performance problem, or attack occurs, it could harm our reputation and the market perception of our solutions; divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel; impair our ability to operate our business; cause us to lose customer information; or harm our customers\u2019 businesses. Any of these events may increase non-renewals, limit our ability to acquire new customers, result in delayed or withheld payments from customers, or result in claims against us.\nUndetected defects in our solutions could harm our reputation or decrease market acceptance of our solutions, which would harm our business and results of operations.\nOur solutions may contain undetected defects, such as errors or bugs. We have experienced such defects in the past in connection with new solutions and solution upgrades and we expect that such defects may be found from time to time in the future. Despite testing by us, defects may not be found in our solutions until they are deployed to or used by our customers. In the past, we have discovered software defects in our solutions after they have been deployed to customers.\nSince our customers use our solutions for compliance reasons, any defects, disruptions in service, or other performance problems may damage our customers\u2019 business and could hurt our reputation. We may also be required, or may choose, for customer relations or other reasons, to expend additional resources to correct actual or perceived defects in our solutions. If defects are detected or perceived to exist in our solutions, we may experience negative publicity, loss of competitive position, or diversion of the attention of our key personnel; our customers may delay or withhold payment to us or elect not to renew their subscriptions; other significant customer relations problems may arise; or we may be subject to liability claims for damages. A material liability claim or other occurrence that harms our reputation or decreases market acceptance of our solutions may harm our business and results of operations.\nWe rely on third-party computer hardware, software, content, and services for use in our solutions. Errors and defects, or failure to successfully integrate or license necessary third-party software, content, or services, could cause delays, errors, or failures of our solutions, increases in our expenses, and reductions in our sales, which could harm our results of operations.\nWe rely on computer hardware purchased or leased from, software licensed from, content licensed from, and services provided by a variety of third parties to offer our solutions, including database, operating system, virtualization software, tax requirement content, and geolocation content and services. Any defects in third-party hardware, software, content, or services could result in errors or a failure of our solutions, which could harm our business. For example, in the past, we experienced a period of higher than usual latency and outages that impacted some customers resulting from a third-party provider data center infrastructure failure. In the future, we might need to license other hardware, software, content, or services to enhance our solutions and meet evolving customer requirements. Any inability to use hardware or software could significantly increase our expenses and otherwise result in delays, a reduction in functionality, or errors or failures of our products until equivalent technology is either developed by us or, if available, is identified, obtained through purchase or license, and integrated into our solutions, any of which may reduce demand for our solutions. In addition, third-party licenses may expose us to increased risks, including risks associated with the integration of new technology, the diversion of resources from the development of our own proprietary technology, and our inability to generate revenue from new technology sufficient to offset associated acquisition and maintenance costs, all of which may increase our expenses and harm our results of operations.\nWe rely upon data centers and other systems and technologies provided by third parties to operate our business, and interruptions or performance problems with these centers, systems, and technologies may adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe rely on data centers and other technologies and services provided by third parties in order to operate our business. If such data centers fail to operate properly or become disabled even for a brief period of time, there could be a failover recovery latency, and we could suffer financial loss, a disruption of our business, liability to customers, or damage to our reputation. In addition, our response to any type of disaster may not be successful in preventing the loss of customer data, service interruptions, and disruptions to our operations, or damage to our important facilities.\nOur current cloud service infrastructure is run on AWS, GCP, and other third-party co-location leased data centers, and neither AWS, GCP, nor our other data center providers are obligated to renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, and it is possible that we will not be able to switch our operations to another provider in a timely and cost-effective manner should the need arise. If we are unable to renew our agreements with any of our data center providers on commercially reasonable terms, or if in the future we add data center facility providers, we may face additional costs or expenses or downtime, which could harm our business.\nAny unavailability of, or failure to meet our requirements by, third-party data centers, technologies, or services, could impede our ability to provide services to our customers, harm our reputation, subject us to potential liabilities, result in contract terminations, and adversely affect our customer relationships. Any of these circumstances could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nIncorrect or improper implementation, integration, or use of our solutions could result in customer dissatisfaction and negatively affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and growth prospects.\nOur solutions are deployed in a wide variety of technology environments and integrated into a broad range of complex workflows and third-party software. If we or our customers are unable to implement our solutions successfully, are unable to do so in a timely manner, or our integration partners are unable to integrate with our solutions through our integrations, customer perceptions of our solutions may be impaired, our reputation and brand may suffer, and customers may choose not to renew or expand the use of our solutions.\nIf we fail to effectively maintain and enhance our brand, our business may suffer.\nWe believe that continuing to strengthen our brand will be critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our solutions and will require continued focus on active marketing efforts. Our brand awareness efforts will require continued investment across our business and particularly as we introduce new solutions that we develop or acquire and as we continue to expand in foreign markets. Brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenue, and even if they do, any increased revenue may not offset the expenses incurred in building our brand. If we fail to promote and maintain our brand, or if we incur substantial expense in an unsuccessful attempt to promote and maintain our brand, our business could suffer.\nEconomic conditions and regulatory changes resulting from the United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the E.U. could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOn January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom (the \u201cU.K.\u201d) exited from the E.U., commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit,\u201d and immediately entered into a transition period during which all E.U. rules and trading agreements remained in effect through December 31, 2020. On December 24, 2020, the U.K. and E.U. announced they had entered into a post-Brexit deal on certain aspects of trade and other strategic and political issues. The impact of Brexit is uncertain, but it has the potential to significantly disrupt the free movement of goods, services, and people between the U.K., the E.U., and other nations, increase legal and regulatory complexities, increase costs of conducting business in Europe, and lead to global economic uncertainty. Because we have based our European operations in the U.K., any of these effects of Brexit, among others, could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nServicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt, settle conversions of the notes in cash, repurchase the notes upon a fundamental change, and meet other future capital needs.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on, or to refinance our indebtedness, including our convertible senior notes due 2026 (the \u201c2026 Notes\u201d), depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, industry, competitive, and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt, or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations.\nHolders of the 2026 Notes have the right to require us to repurchase all or any portion of their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In addition, upon conversion of the notes, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the notes being converted. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of notes surrendered therefor or pay cash with respect to notes being converted. In addition, our ability to repurchase the notes or to pay cash upon conversions of the notes may be limited by law, by regulatory authority, or by agreements governing our current or future indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the indenture governing the notes or to pay any cash payable on future conversions of the notes as required by the indenture would constitute a default under the indenture. A default under the indenture or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our current or future indebtedness. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the notes or make cash payments upon conversions thereof.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, of approximately $1.1 billion due to prior period losses. NOLs generated in 2017 and prior will begin to expire in 2025. NOLs generated after 2017 do not expire but are limited to 80% of taxable income when utilized. Furthermore, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its NOLs to offset future taxable income. Our existing NOLs may be subject to limitations arising from previous ownership changes. Future changes in our stock ownership, the causes of which may be outside of our control, could result in an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code. Our NOLs may also be impaired under state laws. Furthermore, our ability to utilize NOLs of companies that we may acquire in the future may be subject to limitations. There is also a risk that due to regulatory changes, such as suspensions on the use of NOLs, or other unforeseen reasons, our existing NOLs could expire or otherwise be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities. For these reasons, we may not be able to realize a tax benefit from the use of some or all our NOLs, whether or not we attain profitability in the U.S.\nWe need to continue making significant investments in software development and equipment to improve our business.\nTo improve the scalability, security, performance, efficiency, availability, and failover aspects of our solutions, and to support the expansion of our solutions into other tax types, such as international VAT, additional excise taxes, or additional lodging taxes, we will need to continue making significant capital equipment expenditures and also invest in additional software and infrastructure development. If we experience increasing demand in subscriptions, we may not be able to augment our infrastructure quickly enough to accommodate such increasing demand. In the event of decreases in subscription sales, certain of our fixed costs, such as for capital equipment, may make it difficult for us to adjust our expenses downward quickly. Additionally, we are continually updating our software and content, creating expenses for us. We may also need to review or revise our software architecture and user experience as we grow, which may require significant resources and investments.\nIf economic conditions worsen, it may negatively affect our business and financial performance.\nOur financial performance depends, in part, on the state of the economy. Declining levels of economic activity may lead to declines in spending and fewer transactions for which transaction tax is due, which may result in decreased revenue for us. Concern about the strength of the economy may slow the rate at which businesses of all sizes are willing to hire an outside vendor to perform the determination and remittance of their transaction taxes and filing of related returns. If our customers and potential customers experience financial hardship as a result of a weak economy, industry consolidation, or other factors, the overall demand for our solutions could decrease. If economic conditions worsen, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be harmed.\nBeginning in the first quarter of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic led to widespread disruptions across the world, including in the states and countries in which we operate. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced and, in the future, may experience decreased demand for our solutions from customers along with slower collections on accounts receivable. Because we recognize revenue over the subscription term, the effect of the pandemic may not be fully reflected in our operating results until future periods. While we have implemented risk mitigation plans, these measures may not be sufficient to prevent adverse impacts on our business and financial condition from COVID-19. The degree to which the COVID-19 pandemic may impact our results of operations and financial condition is unknown at this time and will depend on future developments, including the geographic spread of COVID-19, the emergence of new variants, the severity and the duration of the pandemic, the success of vaccines, and further actions that may be taken by governmental authorities or businesses.\nSales to customers or operations outside the United States may expose us to risks inherent in international sales and could negatively impact our business and results of operations.\nHistorically, transactions occurring outside of the United States have represented a small portion of our revenue. However, we intend to continue efforts to expand our international sales, including through our current sales operations in Europe, India, and Brazil, as well as other countries and regions identified for expansion.\nOperating in international markets, particularly when entering new countries and regions, requires significant resources and management attention and will subject us to regulatory, economic, and political risks that are different from those in the United States, and our international expansion efforts may not be successful. As we expand our international operations, we currently do not have the breadth of partners like that which we have established in the U.S., making us more reliant on the initial partners that we have established to date. For example, a single partner accounts for a significant portion of our European revenue and any failure to retain or expand this relationship could harm our business and results of operations. Other potential risks and challenges associated with sales to customers and operations outside the United States include:\n\u2022\ncompliance with multiple conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations;\n\u2022\ndifferent competitive pressures, including new and different sources of competition, laws and business practices favoring local competitors, different pricing environments, and longer sales cycles;\n\u2022\nlocalization of our solutions, including translation into foreign languages, obtaining and maintaining local content, and providing customer service in various native languages;\n\u2022\ntreatment of revenue from international sources and changes to tax rules, including being subject to foreign tax laws and being liable for paying withholding of income or other taxes in foreign jurisdictions;\n\u2022\nfluctuation of foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the transfer of funds;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022\ndifferent or lesser protection of our intellectual property;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters, acts of war, terrorism, pandemics, or security breaches;\n\u2022\ncompliance with various anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act; and\n\u2022\nregional or national economic and political conditions.\nAny of these factors could negatively impact our business and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Legal, Compliance and Regulatory Matters\nWe hold significant amounts of money on behalf of our customers that we remit to taxing authorities, and this may expose us to liability from errors, delays, fraud, or system failures, which may not be covered by insurance.\nWe handle significant amounts of our customers\u2019 money for remittance to various taxing jurisdictions on their behalf. If our banks\u2019 or our own internal controls and compliance procedures regarding cash management of these funds fail, are hacked or sabotaged, or if our banks or we are the subject of fraudulent behavior by personnel or third parties, we could face significant cash financial losses, including but not limited to significant financial penalties imposed by taxing jurisdictions for late remittances calculated as a percentage of tax payment amounts due. Furthermore, our efforts to remit tax payments to applicable taxing jurisdictions only after receiving the related funds from our customers may fail, which would expose us to the financial risk of collecting from our customers after we have remitted funds on their behalf.\nAdditionally, we are subject to risk from concentration of cash and cash equivalent accounts, including cash from our customers that is to be remitted to taxing jurisdictions, with financial institutions where deposits routinely exceed federal insurance limits. If the financial institutions in which we deposit our customers\u2019 cash were to experience insolvency or other financial difficulty, our access to cash deposits could be limited, any deposit insurance may not be adequate, we could lose our cash deposits entirely, and we could be exposed to liability to our customers. Any of these events would negatively impact our financial condition and liquidity, results of operations, and our reputation.\nWe also invest a portion of our funds held for customers in liquid, investment-grade marketable securities, money market securities, and other cash equivalents. Such investments are subject to general market, interest rate, credit, and liquidity risks. We follow an established investment policy to monitor and mitigate our exposure to liquidity and credit risks. These risks could be more significant, individually or together, during periods of unusual financial market volatility.\nChanges in tax laws and regulations or their interpretation or enforcement may cause us to invest substantial amounts to modify our solutions, cause us to change our business model, or draw new competitors to the market.\nChanges in tax laws or regulations or interpretations of existing taxation requirements in the United States or in other countries may require us to change the manner in which we conduct some aspects of our business and could harm our ability to attract and retain customers. If our platform and solutions are not flexible enough to adapt to changes in tax laws and regulations, our financial condition and results of operations may suffer. In addition, depending on the content of any sales tax legislation, the role of third-party compliance vendors may change and we may need to invest substantial amounts to modify our solutions or our business model. We also could see a decrease in demand, we could see new competitors enter the market, or we could be negatively impacted by such legislation in a way not yet known.\nChanges in the application, scope, interpretation, or enforcement of laws and regulations pertaining to our business may harm our business or results of operations, subject us to liabilities, and require us to implement new compliance programs or business methods.\nWe perform a number of critical business functions for our customers, including remittance of the taxes our customers owe to taxing authorities. Our electronic payment of customers\u2019 taxes may be subject to federal or state laws or regulations relating to money transmission. The federal Bank Secrecy Act requires that financial institutions, of which money transmitters are a subset, register with the U.S. Department of Treasury\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network and maintain policies and procedures reasonably designed to monitor, identify, report and, where possible, avoid money laundering and criminal or terrorist financing by customers. Most U.S. states also have laws that apply to money transmitters, and impose various licensure, examination, and bonding requirements on them. We believe these federal and state laws and regulations were not intended to cover the business activity of remitting transaction taxes that taxpayers owe to the various taxing jurisdictions. However, if federal or state regulators were to apply these laws and regulations to this business activity or if our activities are held by a court to be covered by such laws or regulations, we could be required to expend significant time, money, and other resources to deal with enforcement actions and any penalties that might be asserted, to institute and maintain a compliance program specific to money transmission laws, and possibly to change aspects of how we conduct business to achieve compliance or minimize regulation. Application of these laws to our business could also make it more difficult or costly for us to maintain our banking relationships. Financial institutions may also be unwilling to provide banking services to us due to concerns about the large dollar volume moving into and out of our accounts on behalf of our customers in the ordinary course of our business. As we continue to expand the solutions we offer and the jurisdictions in which we offer them, we could become subject to other licensing, examination, or regulatory requirements relating to financial services.\nOur solutions involve the collection, dissemination, and use of certain personal information, which are subject to numerous laws and regulations. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act, which became effective on January 1, 2020, provides a private right of action for data breaches and requires companies that process information of California residents to make disclosures to consumers about their data collection, use, and sharing practices and allow consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties. We also are subject to data security and privacy protection requirements in foreign jurisdictions. For example, in 2018 the E.U. adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, which imposes requirements on companies that receive or process personal data of European Economic Area residents and includes significant penalties for non-compliance. Other governments in the U.S. and internationally have adopted or are considering similar types of data protection laws and regulations. We may incur significant costs to comply with these laws and regulations. A security breach or other failure to safeguard consumer data could subject us to costs associated with notice and remediation, as well as potential regulatory investigations or enforcement actions, and possibly to civil liability. If governmental authorities were to expand their enforcement activities, or change their interpretation of the applicability of these laws, or if new laws were to be adopted, compliance burdens and costs could increase significantly, harming our results of operations and possibly the manner in which we conduct our business.\nOur ability to protect our intellectual property is limited and our solutions are, and may in the future be, subject to claims of infringement by third parties.\nOur success depends, in part, upon our proprietary technology, processes, trade secrets, and other proprietary information and our ability to protect this information from unauthorized disclosure and use. We primarily rely upon a combination of confidentiality procedures, contractual provisions, copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws, and other similar measures to protect our proprietary information and intellectual property. We also use patents, including those of our acquired businesses, to protect certain of our intellectual property. Our trademarks and service marks include Avalara, the Avalara logo, AvaTax, the Avalara Compliance Cloud, and \u201cTax compliance done right,\u201d marks for our acquired businesses, and various marketing slogans. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our solutions or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary, and third parties may attempt to develop similar technology independently. In addition, if unauthorized disclosure of our source code occurs through security breach, cyber-attack, internal theft, or otherwise, we could lose future trade secret protection for that source code, which could make it easier for third parties to compete with our products. Our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate.\nIn addition, third parties have claimed, and may in the future claim, infringement by us with respect to current or future solutions or other intellectual property rights. See \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d in Part I, Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding recent litigation. The software and internet industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, trademarks, and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. The outcome of any claims or litigation, regardless of the merits, is inherently uncertain. Any existing or future claims and lawsuits, and the disposition of such claims and lawsuits, whether through settlement or licensing discussions, or litigation, could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve, divert management attention from executing our strategies, result in efforts to enjoin our activities, lead to attempts on the part of other parties to pursue similar claims, and, in the case of intellectual property claims, require us to change our technology, change our business practices, pay monetary damages, or enter into short- or long-term royalty or licensing agreements. Any adverse determination related to any existing or future intellectual property claims or other litigation could prevent us from offering our solutions to others, could be material to our financial condition or cash flows, or both, or could otherwise harm our results of operations.\nIndemnity provisions in our subscription agreements potentially expose us to substantial liability for intellectual property infringement and other losses.\nIn many of our subscription agreements with our customers, we agree to indemnify our customers against any losses or costs incurred in connection with certain claims by a third party, including claims alleging that a customer\u2019s use of our solutions infringes on the intellectual property rights of the third party. Customers facing infringement claims or other indemnifiable claims may in the future seek indemnification from us under the terms of our contracts. If such claims are successful, or if we are required to indemnify or defend our customers from these or other claims, these matters could be disruptive to our business and management and harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe use open source software in our platform and solutions, which may subject us to litigation or other actions that could harm our business.\nWe use open source software in our platform and solutions, and we may use more open source software in the future. In the past, companies that have incorporated open source software into their products have faced claims challenging the ownership of open source software or compliance with open source license terms. Accordingly, we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software or claiming noncompliance with open source licensing terms. Some open source software licenses require users who incorporate open source software as part of their software or services to publicly disclose all or part of the source code to such software or make available any derivative works of the open source code on unfavorable terms or at no cost. If applicable, such licenses could require us to release our proprietary source code, pay damages, re-engineer our applications, discontinue sales, or take other remedial action, any of which could harm our business. In addition, if the license terms for updated or enhanced versions of the open source software we utilize change, we may be forced to re-engineer our platform or solutions or incur additional costs.\nRisks Relating to Ownership of Our Common Stock and Convertible Notes\nOur stock price has been and likely will continue to be volatile and may decline regardless of our operating performance, resulting in substantial losses for investors in our common stock.\nFrom June 15, 2018, the date that our common stock started trading on the New York Stock Exchange, through December 31, 2021, the trading price of our common stock has ranged from $28.09 per share to $191.67 per share. The market price and trading volume of our common stock may fluctuate significantly regardless of our operating performance, in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating and financial performance and prospects and the performance of other technology companies generally, or those in our industry in particular;\n\u2022\nthe financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections, or our failure to meet these projections;\n\u2022\nfailure of securities analysts to maintain coverage of our company, changes in securities analysts\u2019 financial estimates or ratings, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant technical innovations, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, results of operations, or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nchanges in our Board of Directors (\u201cBoard\u201d) or management;\n\u2022\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market, including as a result of trends in the economy as a whole;\n\u2022\nsales of large blocks of our common stock by us or our shareholders;\n\u2022\nlawsuits threatened or filed against us;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws or regulations applicable to our business;\n\u2022\nchanges in our capital structure, such as future issuances of debt or equity securities;\n\u2022\nshort sales, hedging, and other derivative transactions involving our capital stock;\n\u2022\nother events or factors, including those resulting from war, terrorism, or responses to these events; and\n\u2022\nthe other factors described in these risk factors.\nFuture sales of our common stock or equity-linked securities in the public market could lower the market price for our common stock and adversely impact the trading price of the 2026 Notes.\nIn the future, we may sell additional shares of our common stock or equity-linked securities to raise capital. In addition, a substantial number of shares of our common stock is reserved for issuance upon the exercise of stock options, vesting of restricted stock units and performance stock units, and under our employee stock purchase plan. We cannot predict the size of future issuances or the effect, if any, that they may have on the market price for our common stock. The issuance and sale of substantial amounts of common stock or equity-linked securities, or the perception that such issuances and sales may occur, could adversely affect the trading price of the notes and the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity or equity-linked securities.\nThe capped call transactions may affect the value of the 2026 Notes and our common stock.\nIn connection with the pricing of the 2026 Notes, we entered into capped call transactions with certain financial institutions (the \u201coption counterparties\u201d). The capped call transactions cover, subject to customary adjustments, the number of shares of our common stock initially underlying the 2026 Notes. The capped call transactions are expected to offset the potential dilution as a result of conversion of the notes.\nThe option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify the hedge positions they established in connection with entering into the capped call transactions by entering into or unwinding various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions (and are likely to do so on each exercise date of the capped call transactions, which are expected to occur during the 40 trading day period beginning on the 41st scheduled trading day prior to the maturity date of the notes, or following any termination of any portion of the capped call transactions in connection with any repurchase, redemption, or early conversion of the notes). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock or the notes.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired.\nAs a public company, we are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal control. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and provide a management report on internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nOur current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in our business. Further, a material weakness or weaknesses in our disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting may be discovered in the future. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement could harm our results of operations or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and may result in a restatement of our financial statements for prior periods. Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting also could adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that we are required to include in our periodic reports that will be filed with the SEC. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, and could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on the New York Stock Exchange.\nProvisions in our charter documents and under Washington law could make an acquisition of our company more difficult and limit attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove our current management.\nOur Articles of Incorporation, our Bylaws, and Washington law include a number of provisions that may have the effect of deterring takeovers or delaying or preventing changes in control or changes in our management that a shareholder might deem to be in his or her best interest. In addition, because our Board is responsible for appointing our management, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for shareholders to replace members of our Board. These provisions include the following:\n\u2022\nour Board may issue up to 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock, with any rights or preferences as it may designate;\n\u2022\nour Board is divided into three classes with the directors in each class serving for three-year terms, and one class being elected each year;\n\u2022\na director may only be removed for cause by the affirmative vote of our shareholders;\n\u2022\nvacancies on our Board may be filled only by the Board;\n\u2022\nonly the Board may change the size of our Board;\n\u2022\nour shareholders may act by written consent only by obtaining unanimous written consent;\n\u2022\nspecial meetings of shareholders may only be called by our Board, chairperson of our Board, chief executive officer, or president;\n\u2022\nshareholders seeking to present proposals before a meeting of shareholders or to nominate candidates for election as directors at a meeting of shareholders must provide timely advance written notice to us, and specify requirements as to the form and content of a shareholder\u2019s notice;\n\u2022\nprohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n\u2022\nour shareholders can amend or repeal the Bylaws only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding voting power of our capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single group; and\n\u2022\nunless approved by a majority of our \u201ccontinuing directors\u201d specified provisions of our Articles may not be amended or repealed without the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding voting power of our capital stock entitled to vote on the action, voting together as a single group. In addition, we are governed by the provisions of Chapter 23B.19 of the Washington Business Corporation Act, which prohibits certain business combinations between us and certain significant shareholders unless specified conditions are met.", "PERMNO": 17855, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "AVLR"}
