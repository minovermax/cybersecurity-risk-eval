RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the following factors which could materially affect our business, financial condition, cash flows or future results. Any one of these factors could cause the Company\u2019s actual results to vary materially from recent results or from anticipated future results. The risks described below are not the only risks facing our Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results.\nRisk Factor Summary\nRisks Related to Our Strategy\n\u25cf\nOur financial condition and results of operations for future periods may be adversely affected by the COVID-19 outbreak or other outbreaks of infectious disease or similar public health threats and the resulting economic impact.\n\u25cf\nLower levels of economic activity in our end markets could adversely affect our operating results.\n\u25cf\nOur business is cyclical and seasonal, and in downward economic cycles our operating profits and cash flows could be adversely affected.\n\u25cf\nOur operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic, political and market conditions.\n\u25cf\nThe inability to effectively execute our business strategies could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n\u25cf\nThe markets in which we operate are subject to competitive pressures that could affect selling prices, and therefore could adversely affect our operating results.\n\u25cf\nWe have a concentration of net sales to the petroleum/convenience store market, and any substantial change in this market could have an adverse effect on our business.\n\u25cf\nThe Company may pursue future growth through strategic acquisitions and investments, which may not yield anticipated benefits.\n\u25cf\nIf we do not develop the appropriate new products or if customers do not accept new products, we could experience a loss of competitive position which could adversely affect future revenues.\n\u25cf\nIf we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property, we may lose some of our competitive advantage.\nRisks Related to our Operations\n\u25cf\nSudden or unexpected changes in a customer\u2019s creditworthiness could result in significant accounts receivable write-offs.\n\u25cf\nPrice increases, significant shortages of raw materials and components, shortages in transportation and an increase in fuel prices could adversely affect our operating margin.\n\u25cf\nOur information technology systems are subject to certain cyber risks and could be subject to disasters that are beyond our control.\n\u25cf\nLabor shortages or increases in labor costs could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\n\u25cf\nIf the Company\u2019s products are improperly designed, manufactured, packaged, or labeled, the Company may need to recall those items, may have increased warranty costs, and could be the target of product liability claims.\n\u25cf\nChanges in a customer\u2019s demands and commitment to proprietary inventory could result in significant inventory write-offs.\n\u25cf\nThe turnover of independent commissioned sales representatives could cause a significant disruption in sales volume.\n\u25cf\nThe Company may be unable to sustain significant customer and/or channel partner relationships.\n\u25cf\nA loss of key personnel or inability to attract qualified personnel could have an adverse effect on our operating results.\n\u25cf\nChanges in a shift in product mix can have a significant impact on our gross margins.\nRisks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters\n\u25cf\nAny actual or perceived failure by us to comply with legal or regulatory requirements related to privacy or data security in one or multiple jurisdictions could result in proceedings, actions, or penalties against us.\n\u25cf\nThe costs of litigation and compliance with environmental regulations, if significantly increased, could have an adverse effect on our operating profits.\n\u25cf\nPotential changes in U.S. trade policies could have a material adverse effect on the Company.\n- 4 -\nRisks Related to Financial Matters\n\u25cf\nA significant decline in our stock price could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital.\n\u25cf\nChanges in the method of determining London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\"), or the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate, may adversely affect interest expense related to outstanding debt\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR STRATEGY\nOur financial condition and results of operations for future periods may be adversely affected by the COVID-19 outbreak or other outbreaks of infectious disease or similar public health threats and the resulting economic impact.\nCOVID-19 and variants thereof continue to spread globally and resulted in authorities implementing numerous measures in 2020 and 2021 to try to contain the virus, such as but not limited to travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders, and shutdowns. These measures have impacted previous operating results and may continue to impact our workforce and operations, the operations of our customers, and those of our respective vendors and suppliers if the virus continues to spread resulting in further mandated actions. We have experienced some limited disruptions in supply from some of our suppliers, although the disruptions to date have not been significant. Additionally, there was a disruption to the construction markets, as well as inventory de-stocking by our distributors, which had a negative impact to sales. Restrictions on access to our manufacturing facilities or on our support operations or workforce, or similar limitations for our vendors and suppliers, and restrictions or disruptions of transportation, such as reduced availability of air transport, port closures, and increased border controls or closures, could limit our capacity to meet customer demand, lead to increased costs and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe outbreak continues to increase economic and demand uncertainty. These uncertainties could make it more difficult for us to assess the quality of our product order backlog and to estimate future financial results. The outbreak of COVID-19 caused an economic slowdown, and it is increasingly possible that its continued spread could lead to a global recession, which could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and on our financial condition and results of operations. The spread of COVID-19 caused us to modify our business practices in fiscal 2021 (including employee travel, employee work locations, limitations on physical participation in meetings, events and conferences, and responsible efforts to preserve cash and control spending. We may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners, and suppliers. There is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus and its consequences, and our ability to perform critical functions could be harmed. In addition, given the challenges posed by COVID-19, our workforce operated at reduced levels at our manufacturing facilities, which had an adverse impact on our ability to timely meet future customer orders.\nThe duration of further business disruption and related financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. However, it may materially affect our ability to obtain raw materials and components, manage customer credit risk, or manufacture products in a timely manner, and it also may impair our ability to meet customer demand for products, result in lost sales, additional costs, or penalties, or damage our reputation. The extent to which COVID-19 or any other health epidemic will further impact our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and the actions to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, among others. Further, the continued existence of the pandemic may adversely impact the health of our workforce, which could result in higher healthcare costs.\nLower levels of economic activity in our end markets could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur businesses operate in several market segments including the petroleum/convenience markets, parking lot and garage markets, quick-service restaurant market, retail and grocery store markets, the automotive market, the warehouse market, and the sports complex market. Operating results can be negatively impacted by volatility in these markets. Future downturns in any of the markets we serve could adversely affect our overall sales, profitability, and cash flow. In addition, customer difficulties in the future could result from economic declines or issues arising from the cyclical nature of their business and, in turn, result in decreases in product demand, increases in bad debt write-offs, decreases in timely collection of accounts receivable and adjustments to our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable, resulting in material reductions to our revenues and net earnings.\n- 5 -\nOur business is cyclical and seasonal, and in downward economic cycles our operating profits and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nHistorically, sales of our products have been subject to cyclical variations caused by changes in general economic conditions. The demand for our products reflects the capital investment decisions of our customers, which depend upon the general economic conditions of the markets that our customers serve. During periods of expansion in construction and industrial activity, we generally have benefited from increased demand for our products. Conversely, downward economic cycles in these industries result in reductions in sales and pricing of our products, which may reduce our profits and cash flow. During economic downturns, customers also tend to delay purchases of new products. The cyclical and seasonal nature of our business could at times adversely affect our liquidity and financial results.\nOur operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic, political and market conditions.\nEconomic and political conditions worldwide have from time to time contributed to slowdowns in our industry at large, as well as to the specific markets in which we operate. When combined with ongoing customer consolidation activity and periodic manufacturing and inventory initiatives, an uncertain macro-economic and political climate, including but not limited to the effects of possible weakness in domestic and foreign financial and credit markets, could lead to reduced demand from our customers and increased price competition for our products, increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories and uncollectible receivables, and higher overhead costs as a percentage of revenue. If the markets in which we participate experience further economic downturns, as well as a slow recovery period, this could negatively impact our sales and revenue generation, margins, and operating expenses, and consequently have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe inability to effectively execute our business strategies could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nVarious uncertainties and risks are associated with our approach to strategically penetrate certain market verticals, including but not limited to, the development, marketing and selling of new products and solutions, new product development, and the overall development, marketing, and selling of lighting and display solutions. Those uncertainties and risks include but are not limited to diversion of management\u2019s attention; difficulty in retaining or attracting employees; negative impact on relationships and customers; obsolescence of current products and slow new product development; inability to produce products with quality, performance, and cost attributes equal to or better than provided by our competitors; and unforeseen difficulties in the implementation of the management operating structure. Problems with strategy execution could offset anticipated benefits, disrupt service to customers, and impact product quality as well as adversely affect our business. With the addition of new products and solutions, we may encounter new and different competitors that may have more experience with respect to such products and solutions.\nThe markets in which we operate are subject to competitive pressures that could affect selling prices, and therefore could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur businesses operate in markets that are highly competitive, and we compete on the basis of price, quality, service and/or brand name across the industries and markets served. Some of our competitors for certain products, primarily in the Lighting Segment, have greater sales, assets, and financial resources. Some of our competitors are based in foreign countries and have cost structures and prices in foreign currencies. Accordingly, currency fluctuations could cause our U.S. dollar-priced products to be less competitive than our competitors\u2019 products which are priced in other currencies. Competitive pressures could affect prices we charge our customers or demand for our products, which could adversely affect our operating results. Additionally, customers for our products may attempt to reduce the number of vendors from which they purchase in order to reduce the size and diversity of their inventories and their transaction costs. To remain competitive, we will need to invest continuously in research and development, manufacturing, marketing, customer service and support, and our distribution networks. We may not have sufficient resources to continue to make such investments and we may be unable to maintain our competitive position.\nWe have a concentration of net sales to the petroleum / convenience store market, and any substantial change in this market could have an adverse effect on our business.\nApproximately 34% of our net sales in fiscal year 2021 are concentrated in the petroleum/convenience store market. Sales to this market segment are dependent upon the general conditions prevailing in and the profitability of the petroleum/convenience store industry and general market conditions. Our petroleum market business can be subject to reactions by the petroleum industry to world political events, particularly those in the Middle East, to the price and supply of oil and to a decline in demand resulting from an economic recession or other factors. Major disruptions in the petroleum industry generally result in a curtailment of retail marketing efforts, including expansion and refurbishing of retail outlets, by the petroleum industry and adversely affect our business. Any substantial change in purchasing decisions by one or more of our larger customers whether due to actions by our competitors, customer financial constraints, and industry factors or otherwise, could have an adverse effect on our business.\n- 6 -\nThe Company may pursue future growth through strategic acquisitions and investments, which may not yield anticipated benefits\nThe Company has strengthened its business through strategic acquisitions including the recent acquisition of JSI, and may continue to do so as opportunities arise in the future. The Company will benefit from such activity only to the extent that it can effectively leverage and integrate the assets or capabilities of the acquired businesses including, but not limited to, personnel, technology, and operating processes. Moreover, unanticipated events, negative revisions to valuation assumptions and estimates, diversions of resources and management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, and difficulties in attaining synergies, among other factors, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to recover initial and subsequent investments, particularly those related to acquired goodwill and intangible assets, which in turn could result in the impairment of the acquired company\u2019s goodwill and related assets. In addition, such investment transactions may limit the Company\u2019s ability to invest in other activities, which could be more profitable or advantageous.\nIf we do not develop the appropriate new products or if customers do not accept new products, we could experience a loss of competitive position which could adversely affect future revenues.\nThe Company is committed to product innovation on a timely basis to meet customer demands. Development of new products for targeted markets requires the Company to develop or otherwise leverage leading technologies in a cost-effective and timely manner. Failure to meet these changing demands could result in a loss of competitive position and seriously impact future revenues. Products or technologies developed by others may render the Company\u2019s products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive. A fundamental shift in technologies in key product markets could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operating results and competitive position within the industry. More specifically, the development of new or enhanced products is a complex and uncertain process requiring the anticipation of technological and market trends. Rapidly changing product technologies could adversely impact operating results due to potential technological obsolescence of certain inventories or increased warranty expense related to newly developed LED lighting products or any of the Company\u2019s other products and services. We may experience design, manufacturing, marketing, or other difficulties, such as an inability to attract a sufficient number of experienced engineers which could delay or prevent our development, introduction or marketing of new products or enhancements and result in unexpected expenses. Such difficulties could cause us to lose business from our customers and could adversely affect our competitive position. In addition, added expenses could decrease the profitability associated with those products that do not gain market acceptance.\nIf we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property, we may lose some of our competitive advantage.\nOur success is determined in part by our ability to obtain United States and foreign patent protection for our technology and to preserve our trade secrets. Our ability to compete and the ability of our business to grow could suffer if our intellectual property rights are not adequately protected. There can be no assurance that our patent applications will result in patents being issued or that current or additional patents will afford protection against competitors. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secret protection and contractual rights to establish and protect our intellectual property. Failure of our patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secret protection, non-disclosure agreements and other measures to provide protection of our technology and our intellectual property rights could enable our competitors to compete with us more effectively and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, our trade secrets and proprietary know-how may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by others. No guarantee can be given that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or techniques, or otherwise gain access to our proprietary technology.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR OPERATIONS\nSudden or unexpected changes in a customer\u2019s creditworthiness could result in significant accounts receivable write-offs.\nThe Company takes a conservative approach when extending credit to its customers. Customers are granted an appropriate credit limit based upon the due diligence performed on the customer which includes, among other things, the review of the company\u2019s financial statements and banking information, various credit checks, and payment history the customer has with the Company. At any given time, the Company can have a significant amount of credit exposure with its larger customers. While the Company is frequently monitoring its outstanding receivables with its customers, the risk does exist that a customer with large credit exposure is unable to make payment on its outstanding receivables which could result in a significant write-off of accounts receivable.\n- 7 -\nPrice increases, significant shortages of raw materials and components, shortages in transportation and an increase in fuel prices could adversely affect our operating margin.\nThe Company purchases large quantities of raw materials and components such as steel, aluminum, aluminum castings, fabrications, LEDs, power supplies, powder paint, steel tubing, wire harnesses, acrylic, silicon and glass lenses, inks, various graphics substrates such as Aluminum Composite Material (ACM), Expanded PVC sheet (EPVC), vinyl film, styrene, foamboards, wood and wood laminates, condensing units, and digital screens. Materials comprise the largest component of costs, representing approximately 62% and 60% of the cost of sales in 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Company\u2019s operating results could be affected by the availability and price fluctuations of these materials. The Company\u2019s strategic sourcing plans include mitigating supply chain risk by utilizing multiple suppliers for a commodity to avoid significant dependence on any single supplier. Although an interruption of these supplies and components could disrupt our operations, we believe generally that alternative sources of supply exist and could be readily arranged prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, we have increased our safety stock in certain components in order to mitigate a potential disruption to our operations resulting from an anticipated shortage of these same components. With regard to price fluctuations of our raw material and component purchases, the price risk for materials the Company purchases is related to price increases in commodity items that affect all users of the materials, including the Company\u2019s competitors. Significant tariffs or increases in the price of these raw materials and components could further increase the Company\u2019s operating costs and materially adversely affect margins. The Company does, however, seek and qualify new suppliers, negotiate with existing suppliers, and arranges stocking agreements to mitigate risk of supply and price increases. The Company is also impacted by shortages and the availability of transportation of our products to our customers, in addition to rising fuel prices. On occasion, the Company\u2019s Lighting Segment has implemented price increases and surcharges with customers to offset raw material price increases and to mitigate the impact of trade tariffs. The Company\u2019s Display Solutions Segment generally establishes new sales prices, reflective of the then current raw material prices, for each program as it begins with further price increases throughout the life of the program when warranted. Although the Company attempts to pass along increased costs in the form of price increases or surcharges to its customers, the Company may be unsuccessful in doing so for competitive reasons. Even when price increases are successful, the timing of such price increases may lag significantly behind the incurrence of higher costs.\nOur information technology systems are subject to certain cyber risks and could be subject to disasters that are beyond our control.\nWe depend heavily on the proper functioning and availability of our information, communications, and data processing systems, including operating and financial reporting systems, in operating our business. Our systems and those of our technology and communications providers are vulnerable to interruptions caused by natural disasters, power loss, telecommunication and internet failures, cyber-attack, and other events beyond our control. Accordingly, information security and the continued development and enhancement of the controls and processes designed to protect our systems, computers, software, data and networks from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a priority for us.\nWe have been, and in the future may be, subject to cybersecurity and malware attacks and other intentional hacking. Any failure to identify and address or to prevent a cyber- or malware-attack could result in service interruptions, operational difficulties, loss of revenues or market share, liability to our customers or others, the diversion of corporate resources, injury to our reputation and increased service and maintenance costs. In August 2020, we experienced a malware incident affecting certain of our network systems. Immediately following the incident, actions were taken to recover the affected systems and to verify through third-party testing that no confidential data was extracted or compromised. There was minimal business interruption and immaterial net financial impact resulting from the incident. Since the incident occurred, we have significantly enhanced and will continue to improve our cybersecurity controls in order to minimize the likelihood or impact of a reoccurrence.\nOur information systems are protected through physical and software security as well as redundant backup systems, however, as cyber-attacks continue to evolve, we are committed to investing in our cyber defenses in order to mitigate the risks. Some of our software systems are utilized by third parties who provide outsourced processing services which may increase the risk of a cyber-security incident. We have invested and continue to invest in technology security initiatives, employee training, information technology risk management and disaster recovery plans. The development and maintenance of these measures is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become increasingly more sophisticated. Despite our efforts, we are not fully insulated from data breaches, technology disruptions or data loss, which could adversely impact our competitiveness and results of operations. Any future successful cyber-attack or catastrophic natural disaster could significantly affect our operating and financial systems and could temporarily disrupt our ability to provide required services to our customers, impact our ability to manage our operations and perform vital financial processes, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our business.\n- 8 -\nLabor shortages or increases in labor costs could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nWe rely heavily on our employees and any shortage of qualified labor could adversely affect our business. If we are not successful in our recruiting and retention efforts due to general labor shortages or otherwise, we could encounter a shortage of qualified employees in future periods. Any such shortage would decrease our ability to produce sufficient quantities of our product to serve our customers effectively. Such a shortage may also require us to pay higher wages for employees and incur a corresponding reduction in our profitability. Improvements in the economy and labor markets also could impact our ability to attract and retain key personnel. Rising wages across an improving economy can increase the competition among employers for a scarce labor force and make it difficult for us to attract and retain key personnel.\nIf the Company\u2019s products are improperly designed, manufactured, packaged, or labeled, the Company may need to recall those items, may have increased warranty costs, and could be the target of product liability claims\nThe Company may need to recall products if they are improperly designed, manufactured, packaged, or labeled, and the Company\u2019s insurance may not provide full coverage for such recall events. Many of the Company's products and solutions have become complex and include sophisticated and sensitive electronic components. The Company has increasingly manufactured certain of those components and products in its own facilities. Widespread product recalls could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall, the destruction of product inventory, penalties, and lost sales due to the unavailability of a product for a period of time. In addition, products developed by the Company that incorporates LED technology, generally provide for more extensive warranty protection which may result in increased warranty claim costs. The Company may also be liable if the use of any of its products causes harm and could suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against the Company in excess of its insurance limits. The Company may not be able to obtain indemnity or reimbursement from its suppliers or other third parties for the warranty costs or liabilities associated with its products. A significant product recall, warranty claim, or product liability case could also result in adverse publicity, damage to the Company\u2019s reputation, and a loss of consumer confidence in its products.\nChanges in a customer\u2019s demands and commitment to proprietary inventory could result in significant inventory write-offs.\nUpgrading or replacing a customer\u2019s current image requires the manufacture of inventory that is specific to the particular customer. This is particularly true in the Display Solutions Segment. In as many instances as possible, we require a commitment from the customer before the inventory is produced. Our request for a commitment can range from a single site or store to a large rollout program involving many sites or stores. The risk does exist that a customer cannot or will not honor its commitment to us. The reasons a customer cannot or will not honor its commitment can range from the bankruptcy of the customer to the change in the image during the rollout program, to canceling the program before its completion and before the inventory is sold to the customer. In each of these instances, we could be left with significant amounts of inventory required to support the customer\u2019s re-imaging. While all efforts are made to hold the customer accountable for its commitment, there is the risk that a significant amount of inventory could be deemed obsolete or no longer usable which could result in significant inventory write-offs.\nThe turnover of independent commissioned sales representatives could cause a significant disruption in sales volume.\nCommissioned sales representatives are critical to generating business in the Lighting Segment. From time to time, commissioned sales representatives representing a particular region resign or are terminated and replaced with new commissioned sales representatives. During this period of transition from the previous agency to the new one, sales in the particular region will likely fall as business is disrupted. It may take several months for the new sales representative to generate sales that will equal or exceed the previous sales representative. There is also the risk that the new sales agency will not attain the sales volume of the previous agency. These sales representative changes may occur individually as one agency is replaced due to lack of performance or changes may occur as a result of the mergers or acquisitions within the lighting industry. On the other hand, these sales representative changes can be widespread as a result of the competitive nature of the lighting industry as LSI and its competition vie for the strongest sales agency in a particular region.\nThe Company may be unable to sustain significant customer and/or channel partner relationships.\nRelationships with customers are directly impacted by the Company\u2019s ability to deliver quality products and services. The loss of or a substantial decrease in the volume of purchases by certain large customers could significantly harm the Company. The Company has relationships with channel partners such as electrical distributors, independent sales agencies, system integrators, contractors and value-added resellers, to name a few. While the Company maintains positive, and in many cases long-term relationships with these channel partners, the loss of a number of channel partners or substantial decrease in the volume of purchases from a major channel partner or group of channel partners could adversely affect the Company.\n- 9 -\nA loss of key personnel or inability to attract qualified personnel could have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nThe Company\u2019s future success depends on the ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical, managerial, marketing and finance personnel, and, to a significant extent, upon the efforts and abilities of senior management. The Company\u2019s management philosophy of cost-control results in a lean workforce. Future success of the Company will depend on, among other factors, the ability to attract and retain other qualified personnel, particularly executive management, research and development engineers, and sales professionals. The loss of the services of any key employees or the failure to attract or retain other qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nChanges in a shift in product mix can have a significant impact on our gross margins\nCertain of our products have higher gross profit margins than others. Further, the difference in gross margin of the products sold within the Lighting and Display Solutions Segments can also vary significantly. Consequently, changes in the product mix of our sales from quarter-to-quarter or from year-to-year can have a significant impact on our reported gross profit margins.\nRISKS RELATED TO LEGAL AND REGULATORY MATTERS\nAny actual or perceived failure by us to comply with legal or regulatory requirements related to privacy or data security in one or multiple jurisdictions could result in proceedings, actions, or penalties against us.\nThere are numerous state, federal and foreign laws, regulations, decisions and directives regarding privacy and the collection, storage, transmission, use, processing, disclosure, and protection of personally identifiable information and other personal, customer or other data, the scope of which is continually evolving and subject to differing interpretations. For example, in the U.S., Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (\u201cHIPAA\u201d) privacy and security rules require us as a business associate to protect the confidentiality of patient health information, and the Federal Trade Commission asserts authority over protection of privacy and the use of cyber security in information systems. In Europe, the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which went into effect in May 2018, imposes several stringent requirements for controllers and processors of personal data that will increase our obligations and, in the event of violations, may impose significant fines of up to the greater of 4% of worldwide annual revenue or \u20ac20 million. In the UK, a Data Protection Bill that substantially implements the GDPR became law in May 2018. China and Russia have also passed laws that require individually identifiable data on their citizens to be maintained on local servers and that may restrict transfer or processing of that data. Further, in June 2018, California passed the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which became effective on January 1, 2020. CCPA imposes stringent data privacy and data protection requirements for the data of California residents and provides for penalties for noncompliance of up to $7,500 per violation. The restrictions imposed by these laws and regulations may limit the use and adoption of our products, reduce overall demand for our products, require us to modify our data handling practices and impose additional costs and burdens. In addition, U.S. and international laws that have been applied to protect user privacy (including laws regarding unfair and deceptive practices in the U.S. and GDPR in the EU) may be subject to evolving interpretations or applications in light of privacy developments. As a result, we may be subject to significant consequences, including penalties and fines, for any failure to comply with such laws, regulations, and directives.\nData protection legislation around the world is comprehensive and complex and there has been a recent trend towards more stringent enforcement of requirements regarding protection and confidentiality of personal data. The restrictions imposed by such laws and regulations may limit the use and adoption of our products and services, reduce overall demand for our products and services, require us to modify our data handling practices, and impose additional costs and burdens. With increasing enforcement of privacy, data protection and cyber security laws and regulations, there is no guarantee that we will not be subject to enforcement actions by governmental bodies or that our costs of compliance will not increase significantly. Enforcement actions can be costly and interrupt regular operations of our business. In addition, there has been a developing trend of civil lawsuits and class actions relating to breaches of consumer data held by large companies. While we have not been named in any such suits, if a substantial breach or loss of data from our records were to occur, we could become a target of such litigation. Any inability to adequately address privacy and security concerns, even if unfounded, or comply with applicable laws, regulations, policies, industry standards, contractual obligations, or other legal obligations could result in additional cost and liability to us, damage our reputation, inhibit sales, and adversely affect our business. Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in enforcement action against us, including fines and public censure, claims for damages by customers and other affected individuals, damage to our reputation and loss of goodwill (both in relation to existing customers and prospective customers), any of which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n- 10 -\nThe costs of litigation and compliance with environmental regulations, if significantly increased, could have an adverse effect on our operating profits.\nWe are, and may in the future be, a party to any number of legal proceedings and claims, including those involving patent litigation, product liability, employment matters, and environmental matters, which could be significant. Given the inherent uncertainty of litigation, we can offer no assurance that existing litigation or a future adverse development will not have a material adverse impact. We are also subject to various laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and the discharge of materials into the environment, and it could potentially be possible we could incur substantial costs as a result of the noncompliance with or liability for clean up or other costs or damages under environmental laws.\nPotential changes in U.S. trade policies could have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nChanges in the U.S. trade policy, U.S. social, political, regulatory, and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade, manufacturing, development and investment in the territories and countries where we currently purchase component parts and sell products, and any resulting negative sentiments towards the United States as a result of such changes, could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely on purchased components that are sourced from or manufactured in foreign countries. Import tariffs and potential import tariffs have resulted or may result in increased prices for these imported goods and materials and, in some cases, may result or have resulted in price increases for domestically sourced goods and materials. Changes in U.S. trade policy have resulted and could result in additional reactions from U.S. trading partners, including adopting responsive trade policies making it more difficult or costly for us to export our products or import goods and materials from those countries. These measures could also result in increased costs for goods imported into the U.S. or may cause us to adjust our foreign supply chain. Either of these could require us to increase prices to our customers which may reduce demand, or, if we are unable to increase prices, result in lowering our margin on products sold.\nWe cannot predict future trade policy or the terms of any renegotiated trade agreements and their impacts on our business. The adoption and expansion of trade restrictions, the occurrence of a trade war, or other governmental action related to tariffs or trade agreements, or policies has the potential to adversely impact demand for our products, our costs, our customers, our suppliers, and the U.S. economy, which in turn could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO FINANCIAL MATTERS\nA significant decline in our stock price could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital.\nThe market price of our common stock has experienced fluctuations in prior years. Our progress in developing and commercializing our products, our quarterly operating results, announcements of new products by us or our competitors, our perceived prospects, changes in general conditions in the economy or the financial markets, adverse events related to our strategic relationships, and other developments affecting us, or our competitors could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially. In addition, in recent years, including in fiscal 2021, the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their operating performance. These market fluctuations, regardless of the cause, may materially and adversely affect our stock price, regardless of our operating results, and this could impact our ability to raise capital.\nChanges in the method of determining London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\"), or the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate, may adversely affect interest expense related to outstanding debt.\nAmounts drawn under our credit facility may bear interest rates in relation to LIBOR, depending on our selection of repayment options. On July 27, 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (\u201cFCA\u201d) in the UK announced that it would phase out LIBOR as a benchmark by the end of 2021. It is unclear whether new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve is considering replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR with a newly created index called the Broad Treasury Financing Rate, calculated with a broad set of short-term repurchase agreements backed by treasury securities. The overall financial market may be disrupted as a result of the phase-out or replacement of LIBOR. Disruption in the financial market or the inability to renegotiate our credit facility with favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, and operating results.\n- 11 -", "PERMNO": 89456, "SIC": 3640, "TIC": "LYTS"}
