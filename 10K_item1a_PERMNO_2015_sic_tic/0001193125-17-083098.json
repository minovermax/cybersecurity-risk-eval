{"cik": "1468328", "company": "Addus HomeCare Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-15", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe risks described below, and the risks described elsewhere in this Form 10-K, could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, cause the trading price of our common stock to decline and cause the actual outcome of matters to differ materially from our current expectations as reflected in forward-looking statements made in this Form 10-K. The risk factors described below and elsewhere in this Form 10-K are not the only risks we face. Our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may also be materially adversely affected by factors that are not currently known to us, by factors that we currently consider immaterial or by factors that are not specific to us, such as general economic conditions.\nYou should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements under \u201cSpecial Caution Concerning Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d All forward-looking statements made by us are qualified by the risk factors described below.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nReductions in reimbursement and other changes to Medicaid, Medicaid waiver, other state and local medical and social programs could adversely affect our client caseload, units of service, net service revenues, gross profit and profitability.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we derived approximately 70.4% of our net service revenues from state and local governmental agencies, primarily through Medicaid and Medicaid waiver programs. Governmental agencies generally condition their agreements upon a sufficient budgetary appropriation. Almost all of the states in which we operate have experienced periodic financial pressures and budgetary shortfalls due to challenging economic conditions and the rising costs of healthcare, and the Medicaid program is often a state\u2019s largest program. As a result, many states have made, are considering or may consider making changes in their Medicaid, Medicaid waiver or other state and local medical and social programs, including enacting legislation designed to reduce Medicaid expenditures.\nChanges at the federal level also affect Medicaid policy and funding and the healthcare industry more broadly. The ACA, for example, made significant changes to Medicaid eligibility requirements. Future health reform efforts or efforts to repeal or significantly change the ACA will likely impact state programs. In addition, the federal government oversees various demonstration projects and Medicaid waiver programs under which states may apply to test new or existing approaches to payment and delivery of Medicaid benefits.\nIf changes in Medicaid policy result in a reduction in available funds for the services we offer or a reduction in the number of beneficiaries eligible for our services, our net service revenues could be negatively impacted. Our profitability depends principally on the levels of government-mandated payment rates and our ability to manage the cost of providing services.\nChanges that may occur at the federal or state level to address budget deficits or otherwise contain costs include:\n\u2022\nlimiting increases in, or decreasing, reimbursement rates;\n\u2022\nredefining eligibility standards or coverage criteria for social and medical programs or the receipt of personal care services under those programs;\n\u2022\nincreasing consumer responsibility, including through increased co-payment requirements;\n\u2022\ndecreasing benefits available under Medicaid programs, such as limiting the number of hours of personal care services that will be covered;\n\u2022\nslowing payments to providers;\n\u2022\nincreasing utilization of self-directed care alternatives or \u201call inclusive\u201d programs; or\n\u2022\nshifting beneficiaries to managed care organizations.\nCertain of these measures have been implemented by, or are proposed in, states in which we operate. In 2016, we derived approximately 53.6% of our total net service revenues from continuing operations from services provided in Illinois, 12.9% of our total net service revenues from continuing operations in New York, 7.5% of our total net service revenues from continuing operations in New Mexico and 4.5% of our total net service revenues from continuing operations from services provided in Washington. Because a substantial portion of our business is concentrated in these states, any significant reduction in expenditures that pay for our services in these states and other states in which we do business may have a disproportionately negative impact on our future operating results. Illinois, in particular, is experiencing budgetary issues. The Governor of Illinois proposed a budget for fiscal year 2017 (which started July 1, 2016) that contains several measures aimed at reducing costs associated with the Illinois Department on Aging. If enacted, these measures could affect the number of clients we serve and our growth in Illinois.\nIn some cases, commercial insurance companies and other private payors rely on government payment systems to determine payment rates. As a result, changes to government healthcare programs that reduce Medicaid payments may negatively impact payments from private payors, as well. Any reduction in reimbursements or imposition of copayments that dissuade the use of our services, or any reduction in reimbursement from private payors, could materially adversely affect our profitability.\nThe implementation of alternative payment models and the transition of Medicaid beneficiaries to managed care organizations may limit our market share and could adversely affect our revenues.\nMany government and commercial payors are transitioning providers to alternative payment models that are designed to promote cost-efficiency, quality and coordination of care. For example, accountable care organizations (\u201cACOs\u201d) incentivize hospitals, physician groups, and other providers to organize and coordinate patient care while reducing unnecessary costs. Several states have implemented, or plan to implement, accountable care models for their Medicaid populations. If we are not included in these programs, or if ACOs establish programs that overlap with our services, we are at risk for losing market share and for a loss of our current business.\nWe may be similarly impacted by state efforts to transition Medicaid beneficiaries to managed care organizations. States are increasingly relying on managed care to deliver services within their Medicaid programs as a strategy to control costs. We cannot assure you that we will be able to secure favorable contracts with all or some of the managed care organizations, that our reimbursement under these programs will remain at current levels, that the authorizations for services will remain at current levels or that our profitability will remain at levels consistent with past performance. In addition, operational processes may not be well defined as a state transitions beneficiaries to managed care. For example, communication of changes to either the managed care organization or the consumers may be unclear. Membership, new referrals and the related authorization for services to be provided may be delayed, which may result in delays in service delivery to consumers or in payment for services rendered. Difficulties with operational processes may negatively affect our revenue growth rates, cash flow and profitability for services provided.\nOther cost-saving initiatives may be presented by the government and commercial payors to control costs that subject our company to financial risk. We cannot predict at this time what effect alternative payment models may have on our company.\nOur revenues are concentrated in a small number of states which will make us particularly sensitive to regulatory and economic changes in those states.\nOur revenues are particularly sensitive to regulatory and economic changes in states in which we generate a significant portion of our revenues, including Illinois, New York, New Mexico and Washington. Accordingly, any change in the current demographic, economic, competitive or regulatory conditions in these states could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Changes to the Medicaid programs in these states could also have a disproportionately adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nEfforts to reduce the costs of the Illinois Department on Aging program could adversely affect our service revenues and profitability.\nIn 2016, we derived approximately 42.1% of our revenue from continuing operations from the Illinois Department on Aging programs. In his fiscal year 2016 budget proposal, the Governor of Illinois proposed changes aimed at reducing expenditures by the Illinois Department on Aging, such as an income cap and higher threshold of need for eligibility in the Community Care Program, as well as elimination of the add-on rate the Illinois Department on Aging had been paying Community Care Program service providers to help those providers pay for employee healthcare. Illinois did not enact a budget for fiscal year 2016 and therefore none of\nthe Governor of Illinois\u2019s proposals were enacted. The Governor of Illinois also issued a proposed budget for fiscal year 2017, which began July 1, 2016. In his proposed 2017 budget, the Governor again offered several measures intended to reduce costs associated with the Illinois Department on Aging, such as shifting non-Medicaid eligible seniors from the Community Care Program to a new program known as the Community Reinvestment Program, a move that the Governor estimated will save approximately $197 million in fiscal year 2017. At this time, it is difficult to ascertain how significant an impact these initiatives will have on our business. If they impact the eligibility of our consumers, the number of hours authorized or services provided to existing consumers, they would adversely affect our service revenues and growth.\nDelays in reimbursement due to state budget deficits may increase in the future, adversely affecting our liquidity.\nThere is generally a delay between the time that we provide services and the time that we receive reimbursement or payment for these services. Many of the states in which we operate are operating with budget deficits for their current fiscal year. These and other states may in the future delay reimbursement, which would adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, from time to time, procedural issues require us to resubmit claims before payment is remitted, which contributes to our aged receivables. Additionally, unanticipated delays in receiving reimbursement from state programs due to changes in their policies or billing or audit procedures may adversely impact our liquidity and working capital. We fund operations primarily through the collection of accounts receivable.\nSpecifically, the State of Illinois is currently reimbursing us on a delayed basis. The State of Illinois did not adopt a comprehensive budget for fiscal year 2016, which ended on June 30, 2016, and it has not yet adopted a comprehensive budget for fiscal year 2017, which began on July 1, 2016. Stopgap budget legislation was enacted on June 30, 2016, which appropriated funds through December 31, 2016. Without a budget, the State is not authorized to pay for non-Medicaid consumers we serve. Non-Medicaid consumers from Illinois represent approximately 15% of our current total annual revenues. Our accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts at December 31, 2016 increased 37.7% compared to 2015, due in part to delays from the State of Illinois in the second half of 2016. Accounts receivable attributable to delayed payments from the Illinois Department on Aging totaled $53.0 million at the end of 2016, approximately $36.8 related to Non-Medicaid consumers and approximately $16.2 related to Medicaid consumers. Reimbursements from the State of Illinois could be further delayed due to the lack of a budget for fiscal year 2017 and because current forecasts indicate higher state deficits in the near future.\nThe implementation or expansion of self-directed care programs in states in which we operate may limit our ability to increase our market share and could adversely affect our revenue.\nSelf-directed care programs are funded by Medicaid and state and local agencies and allow the consumer to exercise discretion in selecting personal care service providers. Consumers may hire family members, friends or neighbors to provide services that might otherwise be provided by a personal care service agency provider, such as our company. Most states and the District of Columbia have implemented self-directed care programs, to varying degrees and for different types of consumers. States are under pressure from the federal government and certain advocacy groups to expand these programs. CMS has provided states with specific Medicaid waiver options for programs that offer person-centered planning, individual budgeting or self-directed services and support as part of the CMS Independence Plus initiative introduced in 2002 under an Executive Order of the President. Certain private foundations have also granted resources to states to develop and study programs that provide financial accounts to consumers for their long-term care needs, and counseling services to help prepare a plan of care that will help meet those needs. Expansion of these self-directed programs may erode our Medicaid consumer base and could adversely affect our net service revenues.\nFailure to renew a significant agreement or group of related agreements may materially impact our revenue.\nIn 2016, we derived approximately 42.1% of our net service revenues from continuing operations under agreements with the Illinois Department on Aging. Each of our agreements is generally in effect for a specific term.\nEven though our agreements are for a specific term, they are generally terminable with 60 days\u2019 notice. Our ability to renew or retain our agreements depends on our quality of service and reputation, as well as other factors over which we have little or no control, such as state appropriations and changes in provider eligibility requirements. Additionally, failure to satisfy any of the numerous technical renewal requirements in connection with our proposals for agreements could result in a proposal being rejected even if it contains favorable pricing terms. Failure to obtain, renew or retain agreements with major payors may negatively impact our results of operations and revenue. We can give no assurance these agreements will be renewed on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nOur industry is highly competitive, fragmented and market-specific, with limited barriers to entry.\nWe compete with personal care service providers, home health providers, private caregivers, larger publicly held companies, privately held companies, privately held single-site agencies, hospital-based agencies, not-for-profit organizations, community-based organizations and self-directed care programs. In addition, certain governmental payors contract for services with multiple personal care service providers and other provider types such that our relationships with these payors are not exclusive. Some of our competitors may have greater financial, technical, political and marketing resources, name recognition or a larger number of consumers and payors than we do. In addition, some of these organizations offer more services than we do in the markets in which we operate. These competitive advantages may limit our ability to attract and retain referrals in local markets and to increase our overall market share.\nIn most states, there are limited barriers to entry in providing personal care services. The trend regarding these barriers is mixed; for example, Illinois changed the way in which it procures personal care service providers in 2009, allowing, per federal Medicaid regulation, all providers that are willing and capable to obtain state approval and provide services. However, more states have added a licensing requirement for home care services and economic changes such as increases in minimum wage, the employer mandate under ACA, and changes in Department of Labor rules can also impact the ease of entry into a market. These factors may affect competition in our states.\nLocal competitors may develop strategic relationships with referral sources and payors. This could result in pricing pressures, loss of or failure to gain market share or loss of consumers or payors, any of which could harm our business. In addition, existing competitors may offer new or enhanced services that we do not provide, or be viewed by consumers as a more desirable local alternative. The introduction of new and enhanced service offerings, in combination with the development of strategic relationships by our competitors, could cause a decline in revenue, a loss of market acceptance of our services and a negative impact on our results of operations.\nIf we fail to comply with the laws and extensive regulations governing our business, we could be subject to penalties or be required to make changes to our operations, which could negatively impact our profitability.\nThe federal government and the states in which we operate regulate our industry extensively. The laws and regulations governing our operations, along with the terms of participation in various government programs, impose certain requirements on the way in which we do business, the services we offer, and our interactions with providers and consumers. These requirements include matters related to:\n\u2022\nlicensure, certification and enrollment with government programs;\n\u2022\neligibility requirements and appropriateness of services provided necessity of care;\n\u2022\nadequacy and quality of services;\n\u2022\nqualifications and training of personnel;\n\u2022\nconfidentiality, maintenance, data breach, identity theft and security issues associated with health-related and personal information and medical records;\n\u2022\nenvironmental protection, health and safety;\n\u2022\nrelationships with physicians, other referral sources and recipients of referrals;\n\u2022\noperating policies and procedures;\n\u2022\naddition of facilities and services;\n\u2022\nadequacy of documentation for services provided;\n\u2022\nbilling and coding for services;\n\u2022\ntimely and proper handling of overpayments; and\n\u2022\ndebt collection.\nThese laws include, but are not limited to, HIPAA, HITECH, the Stark Law, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal False Claims Act and similar state laws. While we endeavor to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we cannot assure you that our practices are fully compliant, or that courts or regulatory agencies will not interpret those laws and regulations in ways that will adversely affect our practices. Also, the laws and regulations governing our business are subject to change, interpretations may evolve or enforcement focus may shift. These changes could subject us to allegations of impropriety or illegality, require restructuring of relationships with referral sources and providers or otherwise require changes to our operations. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could lead to civil sanctions and criminal penalties, the termination of rights to participate in federal and state-sponsored programs, exclusion from federal healthcare programs, the suspension or revocation of licenses and nonpayment or delays in our ability to bill and collect for services provided, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial results. Federal and state government agencies have heightened and coordinated civil and criminal enforcement efforts throughout the healthcare industry.\nIn addition, as a result of our participation in Medicaid, Medicaid waiver, Medicare programs, Veterans Health Administration programs and other state and local governmental programs, and pursuant to certain of our contractual relationships, we are subject to various reviews, compliance audits and investigations by governmental authorities and other third parties to verify our compliance with these programs and agreements as well as applicable laws, regulations and conditions of participation. If we fail to meet any of the conditions of participation or coverage with respect to state licensure or our participation in Medicaid, Medicaid waiver, Medicare programs, Veterans Health Administration programs and other state and local governmental programs, we may receive a notice of deficiency from the applicable surveyor or authority. Failure to institute a plan of action to correct the deficiency within the period provided by the surveyor or authority could result in civil or criminal penalties, the imposition of fines or other sanctions, damage to our reputation, cancellation of our agreements, suspension or revocation of our licenses or disqualification from federal and state reimbursement programs. These actions may adversely affect our ability to provide certain services, to receive payments from other payors and to continue to operate. Further, actions taken against one of our locations may subject our other locations to adverse consequences. We may also fail to discover all instances of noncompliance by our acquisition targets, which could subject us to adverse remedies once those acquisitions are complete. Any termination of one or more of our locations from any federal, state or local program for failure to satisfy such program\u2019s conditions of participation could adversely affect our net service revenues and profitability.\nWe are subject to federal and state laws that govern our employment practices, including minimum wage and local living wage ordinances. Failure to comply with these laws, or changes to these laws that increase our employment-related expenses, could adversely impact our operations.\nWe are required to comply with all applicable federal and state laws and regulations relating to employment, including occupational safety and health requirements, wage and hour requirements, employment insurance and equal employment opportunity laws. These laws can vary significantly among states and can be highly technical. Costs and expenses related to these requirements are a significant operating expense and may increase as a result of, among other things, changes in federal or state laws or regulations requiring employers to provide specified benefits to employees, increases in the minimum wage and local living wage ordinances, increases in the level of existing benefits or the lengthening of periods for which unemployment benefits are available. We may not be able to offset any increased costs and expenses. Furthermore, any failure to comply with these laws, including even a seemingly minor infraction, can result in significant penalties which could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition, certain individuals and entities, known as excluded persons, are prohibited from receiving payment for their services rendered to Medicaid, Medicare and other federal and state healthcare program beneficiaries. If we inadvertently hire or contract with an excluded person, or if any of our current employees or contractors becomes an excluded person in the future without our knowledge, we may be subject to substantial civil penalties, including up to $11,052 for each item or service furnished by the excluded individual to a federal or state healthcare program beneficiary, an assessment of up to three times the amount claimed and exclusion from the program.\nUnder the ACA, each of our subsidiaries that employ employees (\u201cEIN\u2019s\u201d) were required to offer a minimum level of health coverage for 95% of our full-time employees in 2016 or be subject to an annual penalty. Five of our EIN\u2019s met this requirement and four did not. We are evaluating our options to minimize our exposure going forward. We could be assessed fines or penalties as a result of this matter if an employee obtains medical coverage through federal and state health exchanges.\nIn September 2013, the United States Department of Labor (the \u201cDepartment of Labor\u201d) announced the adoption of a rule that extended the minimum wage and overtime pay requirements of federal law to most direct care workers, such as home health aides, home care aides and certified nursing assistants. These employees have been exempt from federal wage laws since 1974. The new rule was slated to take effect on January 1, 2015, (though the Department of Labor announced on October 7, 2014 that it would delay enforcement of the rule until June 30, 2015). Two decisions from the United States Court for the District of Columbia, handed down on December 22, 2014 and January 14, 2015, invalidated key provisions in the rule, effectively restoring the status quo in which home care agencies and other third party employers were able to utilize the \u201ccompanionship services\u201d exemption to the minimum wage and overtime requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act. However, on August 21, 2015, the United States District Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia reversed the lower court\u2019s previous ruling and reinstated the Department of Labor\u2019s rule to extend federal minimum wage and overtime pay protections to most direct care workers. The rule became effective on October 13, 2015, and the Department of Labor began enforcement of the rule in November 2015. The National Association for Home Care and Hospice has appealed the Court of Appeals decision to the Supreme Court of the United States. The Supreme Court refused to grant certiorari and review the appeal. As a result the Department of Labor\u2019s rule has become final. Historically, we did not rely on the exemption to minimum wage and overtime regulations that were eliminated by the Department of Labor. Certain acquired entities did rely on the exemption, however, beginning in November of 2015 all Addus HomeCare operations were in compliance with the new rules.\nA number of states also require that direct care workers receive state-mandated minimum wage and/or overtime pay. Opponents say that the new protections will make in-home care more expensive for government programs such as Medicaid that pay for such services, and that the new rule could result in a reduction in covered services. We will continue to evaluate the effect of the new rule on our operations.\nThe Department of Labor also issued a proposed rule that, among other things, would increase the minimum annual salary required for certain employees to be classified as \u201cexempt\u201d from entitlement to overtime compensation under the Fair Labor Standards Act (\u201cFLSA\u201d) from $23,660 to $47,476. Under the proposed rule which was scheduled to go into effect on December 1, 2016, this salary level would be increased every three years and indexed to the average salary levels for full time employees as reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. If finalized in its current form, this proposed rule could increase our costs by requiring us to pay overtime to additional employees. A number of states filed litigation against the Department of Labor seeking to block this new overtime rule. The federal district court judge for the Eastern District of Texas in which the case was filed issued a preliminary injunction on November 22, 2016, enjoining the Department of Labor from implementing and enforcing the overtime final rule. The Department of Labor has appealed that ruling and, in the meantime, the case before the district court is continuing to move forward.\nOur business may be adversely impacted if the ACA is repealed entirely or if provisions benefitting our operations are significantly modified as a result of the 2016 federal elections.\nThe 2016 federal elections have increased the likelihood that the ACA will be repealed, replaced, or significantly changed. The new presidential administration and certain members of Congress have stated their intent to repeal or make significant changes to the ACA, its implementation and its interpretation. In addition, the president signed an executive order that directs agencies to minimize \u201ceconomic and regulatory burdens\u201d of the ACA, but it is not clear how this will be implemented. There is uncertainty regarding whether, when, and how the ACA will be changed, what alternative provisions, if any, will be enacted, and the impact of alternative provisions on providers and other healthcare industry participants. Certain provisions of the ACA, as currently structured, have been beneficial to our business and results of operations, including the Medicaid expansion. Government efforts to repeal or change the ACA or to implement alternative reform measures could cause our net revenues to decrease and our provision for bad debt to increase.\nNegative publicity or changes in public perception of our services may adversely affect our ability to receive referrals, obtain new agreements and renew existing agreements.\nOur success in receiving referrals, obtaining new agreements and renewing our existing agreements depends upon maintaining our reputation as a quality service provider among governmental authorities, physicians, hospitals, discharge planning departments, case managers, nursing homes, rehabilitation centers, advocacy groups, consumers and their families, other referral sources and the public. While we believe that the services that we provide are of high quality, if studies mandated by Congress in the ACA to make public quality measures are implemented and if our quality measures are deemed to be not of the highest value, our reputation could be negatively affected. Negative publicity, changes in public perceptions of our services or government investigations of our operations could damage our reputation and hinder our ability to receive referrals, retain agreements or obtain new agreements. Increased government scrutiny may also contribute to an increase in compliance costs and could discourage consumers from using our services. Any of these events could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIn addition, in connection with the sale of our Home Health Business, we granted a license to the Purchasers that allows them to use certain of our intellectual property, including the Addus name, for the provision of skilled nursing and related physical therapy healthcare services to individuals in their homes and hospice services in California and Illinois. Although the use of the intellectual property is required to be consistent and at least equal to the level of quality and brand perception prior to the sale, we do not have operational control over the Purchasers. As a result, home health agencies operated by the Purchasers may not be operated in a manner consistent with the standards we uphold at our agencies. If such agencies do not maintain operational standards consistent with the standards we demand of our agencies, the image and brand reputation of Addus may suffer and our business may be materially affected.\nOur growth strategy depends on our ability to manage growing and changing operations and we may not be successful in managing this growth.\nOur business plan calls for significant growth in business over the next several years through the expansion of our services in existing markets and the establishment of a presence in new markets. This growth would place significant demands on our management team, systems, internal controls and financial and professional resources. In addition, we will need to further develop our financial controls and reporting systems to accommodate any such future growth. This could require us to incur expenses for hiring additional qualified personnel, retaining professionals to assist in developing the appropriate control systems and expanding our information technology infrastructure. Our inability to effectively manage growth could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nFuture acquisitions or growth initiatives may be unsuccessful and could expose us to unforeseen liabilities.\nOur growth strategy includes geographical expansion into new markets and the addition of new services in existing markets through the acquisition of local service providers. These acquisitions involve significant risks and uncertainties, including difficulties assimilating acquired personnel and other corporate cultures into our business, the potential loss of key employees or consumers of acquired providers, and the assumption of liabilities and exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired providers. In the past, we have made acquisitions that have not performed as expected or that we have been unable to successfully integrate with our existing operations. In addition, our due diligence review of acquired businesses may not successfully identify all potential issues. For example, we were unable to fully integrate one acquired business because we were unable to procure a necessary government endorsement. The failure to effectively integrate future acquisitions could have an adverse impact on our operations.\nWe have grown our business through de novo locations and we may in the future selectively open new locations in existing and new states. De novo locations involve risks, including those relating to accreditation, hiring new personnel, establishing relationships with referral sources and delays or difficulty in installing our operating and information systems. We may not be successful in establishing de novo locations in a timely manner due to generating insufficient business activity and incurring higher than projected operating cost that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may be unable to pursue acquisitions or expand into new geographic regions without obtaining additional capital or consent from our lenders.\nAt December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had cash balances of $8.0 million and $4.1 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, we had $24.1 million outstanding debt on our credit facility. As of December 31, 2015, we had no outstanding debt on our credit facility. After giving effect to the amount drawn on our credit facility, approximately $16.7 million of outstanding letters of credit at December 31, 2016 and 2015 and borrowing limits based on an advanced multiple of adjusted EBITDA, we had $79.7 million and $58.2 million available for borrowing under the credit facility as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Since our credit facility provides for borrowings based on a multiple of an EBITDA ratio, any declines in our EBITDA would result in a decrease in our available borrowings under our credit facility.\nWe cannot predict the timing, size and success of our acquisition efforts, our efforts to expand into new geographic regions or the associated capital commitments. If we do not have sufficient cash resources or availability under our credit facility, our growth could be limited unless we obtain additional equity or debt financing. In the future, we may elect to issue additional equity securities in conjunction with raising capital, completing an acquisition or expanding into a new geographic region. Such issuances would be dilutive to existing shareholders. In addition, our credit facility prohibits us from consummating more than three acquisitions in any calendar year, consummating any individual acquisition with a purchase price in excess of $25.0 million and consummating acquisitions with a total purchase price in excess of $40.0 million in the\naggregate over the term of the credit facility, without the consent of the lenders. In addition, our credit facility requires, among other things, that we are in pro forma compliance with the financial covenants set forth therein and that no event of default exists before and after giving effect to any proposed acquisition. Our ability to expand in a manner consistent with historic practices may be limited if we are unable to obtain such consent from our lenders.\nAs a result of the indemnification provisions of the Home Health Purchase Agreement pursuant to which we sold Home Health Business, we may incur expenses and liabilities related to periods up to the date of sale or pursuant to our other indemnification obligations thereunder.\nAs a result of the indemnification provisions of the Home Health Purchase Agreement pursuant to which we sold the Home Health Business, we have agreed to indemnify the Purchasers for, among other things, (i) penalties, fines, judgments and settlement amounts arising from a violation of certain specified statutes, including the False Claims Act, the Civil Monetary Penalties Law, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the Stark Law or any state law equivalent in connection with the operation of the Home Health Business prior to the Closing, and (ii) any liability related to the failure of any reimbursement claim submitted to certain government programs for services rendered by the Home Health Business prior to the Closing to meet the requirements of such government programs, or any violation prior to the Closing of any healthcare laws. Such liabilities include amounts to be recouped by, or repaid to, such government programs as a result of improperly submitted claims for reimbursement or those discovered as a result of audits by investigative agencies. All services that we have provided that have been or may be reimbursed by Medicare are subject to retroactive adjustments and/or total denial of payments received from Medicare under various review and audit provisions included in the program regulations. The review period is generally described as six years from the date the services are provided but could be expanded to ten years under certain circumstances if fraud is found to have existed at the time of original billing. In the event that there are adjustments relating to the period prior to the Closing, we may be required to reimburse the Purchasers for the amount of such adjustments, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nIn addition, pursuant to the Home Health Purchase Agreement, we are obligated to indemnify the Purchasers for breaches of representations, warranties and covenants, certain taxes and liabilities related to the pre-Closing period (other than specifically identified assumed liabilities). Any liability we have to the Purchasers under the Home Health Purchase Agreement could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur business may be harmed by labor relations matters.\nWe are subject to a risk of work stoppages and other labor relations matters because our hourly workforce is highly unionized. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 66.1% of our workforce was represented by a national union, SEIU, which is our largest union. We have a national agreement with the SEIU which is currently under negotiation, as well as numerous agreements with local SEIU affiliates which are renegotiated from time to time. These negotiations are often initiated when we receive increases in our hourly rates from various state agencies. Upon expiration of these collective bargaining agreements, we may not be able to negotiate labor agreements on satisfactory terms with these labor unions. A strike, work stoppage or other slowdown could result in a disruption of our operations and/or higher ongoing labor costs, which could adversely affect our business. Labor costs are the most significant component of our total expenditures and, therefore, an increase in the cost of labor could significantly harm our business.\nOur operations subject us to risk of litigation.\nOperating in the personal care services industry exposes us to an inherent risk of wrongful death, personal injury, professional malpractice and other potential claims or litigation brought by our consumers and employees. Because we operate in this industry, from time to time, we are subject to claims alleging that we did not properly treat or care for a consumer that we failed to follow internal or external procedures that resulted in death or harm\nto a consumer or that our employees mistreated our consumers, resulting in death or harm. We are also subject to claims arising out of accidents involving vehicle collisions brought by consumers whom we are transporting or from employees driving to or from home visits. As of December 31, 2016, we operated three adult day services centers which provide transportation for our elderly and disabled consumers. Each of our vehicles transports seven to fourteen passengers to and from our locations. The concentration of consumers in one vehicle increases the risk of larger claims being brought against us in the event of an accident. In order to focus on providing services to consumers in their homes, effective March 1, 2017, Addus ceased the adult day services businesses and sold substantially all of the assets used in our adult day services centers.\nIn addition, regulatory agencies may initiate administrative proceedings alleging violations of statutes and regulations arising from our services and seek to impose monetary penalties on us. We could be required to pay substantial amounts to respond to regulatory investigations or, if we do not prevail, damages or penalties arising from these legal proceedings. We also are subject to potential lawsuits under the federal False Claims Act or other federal and state whistleblower statutes designed to combat fraud and abuse in our industry including the federal False Claims Act litigation discussed in Part I, Item 3 hereof \u201cLegal Proceedings.\u201d This and other similar lawsuits can involve significant monetary awards or penalties which may not be covered by our insurance. If our third-party insurance coverage and self-insurance coverage reserves are not adequate to cover these claims, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Even if we are successful in our defense, civil lawsuits or regulatory proceedings could distract us from running our business or irreparably damage our reputation.\nOur insurance liability coverage may not be sufficient for our business needs.\nAlthough we maintain insurance consistent with industry practice, the insurance we maintain may not be sufficient to satisfy all claims made against us. We cannot assure you that claims will not be made in the future in excess of the limits of our insurance, and any such claims, if successful and in excess of such limits, may have a material adverse effect on our business or assets. We utilize historical data to estimate our reserves for our insurance programs. If losses on asserted claims exceed the current insurance coverage and accrued reserves, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. Changes in our annual insurance costs and self-insured retention limits depend in large part on the insurance market, and insurance coverage may not continue to be available to us at commercially reasonable rates, in adequate amounts or on satisfactory terms.\nInclement weather or natural disasters may impact our ability to provide services.\nInclement weather may prevent our employees from providing authorized services. We are not paid for authorized services that are not delivered due to these weather events. Furthermore, prolonged inclement weather or the occurrence of natural disasters in the markets in which we operate could disrupt our relationships with consumers, employees and referral sources located in affected areas and, in the case of our corporate office, our ability to provide administrative support services, including billing and collection services. For example, our corporate headquarters and a number of our agencies are located in the Midwestern United States, New York and California, increasing our exposure to blizzards and other major snowstorms, ice storms, tornadoes, flooding and earthquakes. The impact of disasters and similar events is inherently uncertain. Future inclement weather or natural disasters may adversely affect our reputation, business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business depends on our information systems. Our operations may be disrupted if we are unable to effectively integrate, manage and maintain the security of our information systems.\nOur business depends on effective and secure information systems that assist us in, among other things, gathering information to improve the quality of consumer care, optimizing financial performance, adjusting consumer mix, monitoring regulatory compliance and enhancing staff efficiency. We rely on an external service\nprovider, McKesson, to provide continual maintenance, upgrading and enhancement of our primary information systems used for our operational needs. The software we license from McKesson supports intake, personnel scheduling, office clinical and centralized billing and receivables management in an integrated database, enabling us to standardize the care delivered across our network of locations and monitor our performance and consumer outcomes. To the extent that McKesson fails to support the software or systems, or if we lose our license with McKesson, our operations could be negatively affected. We anticipate the payroll conversion to ADP to be complete in 2017. To the extent the conversion is delayed or ADP fails to provide support services to ensure the conversion is successfully completed, we could experience an increase in cost as well as a delay in acquisition integration. Either of these outcomes could negatively affect our operations.\nOur business also depends on a comprehensive payroll and human resources system for basic payroll functions and reporting, payroll tax reporting, managing wage assignments and garnishments. We rely on an external service provider, Ultimate Software, to provide continual maintenance, upgrading and enhancement of our primary human resource and payroll systems. To the extent that Ultimate Software fails to support the software or systems, or any of the related support services provided by them, our internal operations could be negatively affected.\nIf we experience a reduction in the performance, reliability, or availability of our information systems, our operations and ability to process transactions and produce timely and accurate reports could be adversely affected. If we experience difficulties with the transition and integration of information systems or are unable to implement, maintain, or expand our systems properly, we could suffer from, among other things, operational disruptions, regulatory problems, and increases in administrative expenses.\nWe have full backup of our key information systems. Should our main datacenter become inoperable because of a natural disaster or terrorist acts, our operations would failover to our geographically separate disaster recovery datacenter with a quick return to operations for all sites and systems. All of our sites and branch offices have redundant connections to our primary and backup datacenters using data lines and cellular connections through VPN or MPLS.\nThe key business functions for our main sites also have redundancies with key functions geographically split between our two main facilities, should one not be available due to the above mentioned scenarios.\nWhile we believe these measures are reasonable, no system of information security is able to eliminate the risk of business disruptions.\nA cyber-attack or security breach could cause a loss of confidential consumer data, give rise to remediation and other expenses, expose us to liability under HIPAA, consumer protection laws, common law or other legal theories, subject us to litigation and federal and state governmental inquiries, damage our reputation, and otherwise be disruptive to our business.\nWe rely extensively on our computer systems to manage clinical and financial data, to communicate with our consumers, payors, vendors and other third parties, and to summarize and analyze our operating results. In spite of our policies, procedures and other security measures used to protect our computer systems and data, there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to cyber-attacks or security breaches in the future. Such attacks or breaches could result in loss of protected patient medical data or other information subject to privacy laws or disrupt our information technology systems or business, potentially exposing us to regulatory action, litigation and liability. We continue to prioritize cyber-security and the development of practices and controls to protect our systems and data. We utilize sophisticated firewalls to mitigate external threats and attacks through daily security content updates and intrusion prevention policies. In addition, all email is scanned for threats and viruses as well as Domain Keys Identified Mail (DKIM) keys authentication and Sender Policy Framework (SPF) records are utilized to mitigate spoofing and phishing attempts. Outgoing email is encrypted based on content and HIPAA regulations. In addition,\nwe are required to comply with the privacy and security laws and regulations of HIPAA as amended by HITECH. If our privacy and security practices are not in compliance with HIPAA and/or if we fail to satisfy applicable breach notification requirements in the event of a security breach, we could be subject to significant fines and penalties. Penalties under HIPAA can be as high as $55,910 per violation (with an annual maximum of $1,677,299 per provision violated) depending on the degree of culpability.\nOur current principal stockholders could have significant influence over us, and they could delay, deter or prevent a change of control or other business combination or otherwise cause us to take action with which you might not agree.\nEos Capital Partners III, L.P. and Eos Partners SBIC III, L.P (the \u201cEos Funds\u201d), together beneficially own approximately 34.0% of our outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2016. As a result, the Eos Funds have the ability to significantly influence all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including:\n\u2022\nchanges to the composition of our board of directors, which has the authority to direct our business and appoint and remove our officers;\n\u2022\nproposed mergers, consolidations or other business combinations; and\n\u2022\namendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws which govern the rights attached to our shares of common stock.\nIn addition, Mark First, one of our directors is affiliated with the Eos Funds.\nThis concentration of ownership of shares of our common stock could delay or prevent proxy contests, mergers, tender offers, open-market purchase programs or other purchases of shares of our common stock that might otherwise give you the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price of our common stock. The interests of the Eos Funds may not always coincide with the interests of the other holders of our common stock. This concentration of ownership may also adversely affect our stock price.\nWe may not be able to attract, train and retain qualified personnel.\nWe must attract and retain qualified personnel in the markets in which we operate in order to provide our services. We compete for personnel with other providers of social and medical services as well as companies in other service-based industries. Competition may be greater for skilled personnel, such as regional and agency directors. Our ability to attract and retain personnel depends on several factors, including our ability to provide employees with attractive assignments and competitive benefits and salaries.\nThe loss of one or more of the members of the executive management team or the inability of a new management team to successfully execute our strategies may adversely affect our business. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel, we may be unable to provide our services, the quality of our services may decline, and we could lose consumers and referral sources.\nWe may be more vulnerable to the effects of a public health catastrophe than other businesses due to the nature of our consumers.\nThe majority of our consumers are older individuals with complex medical challenges, many of whom may be more vulnerable than the general public during a pandemic or in a public health catastrophe. Our employees are also at greater risk of contracting contagious diseases due to their increased exposure to vulnerable consumers. For example, if a flu pandemic were to occur, we could suffer significant losses to our consumer population or a reduction in the availability of our employees and, at a high cost, be required to hire replacements for affected workers. Accordingly, certain public health catastrophes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on the services of our executive officers and other key employees.\nOur success depends upon the continued employment of certain members of our senior management team. We also depend upon the continued employment of the individuals that manage several of our key functional areas, including operations, business development, accounting, finance, human resources, marketing, information systems, contracting and compliance. We have recently changed a majority of the members of senior management, beginning with our CEO. The departure of any member of our senior management team may materially adversely affect our operations.\nIf we were required to write down all or part of our goodwill and/or our intangible assets, our net earnings and net worth could be materially adversely affected.\nGoodwill and intangible assets with finite lives represent a significant portion of our assets. Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations. For example, if our market capitalization drops significantly below the amount of net equity recorded on our balance sheet, it might indicate a decline in our fair value and would require us to further evaluate whether our goodwill has been impaired. If as part of our annual review of goodwill and intangibles, we were required to write down all or a significant part of our goodwill and/or intangible assets, our net earnings and net worth could be materially adversely affected, which could affect our flexibility to obtain additional financing. In addition, if our assumptions used in preparing our valuations for purposes of impairment testing differ materially from actual future results, we may record impairment charges in the future and our financial results may be materially adversely affected. We had $73.9 million and $68.8 million of goodwill and $15.4 million and $10.4 million of intangible assets recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nIt is not possible at this time to determine if there will be any future impairment charge, or if there is, whether such charges would be material. We will continue to review our goodwill and other intangible assets for possible impairment. We cannot be certain that a downturn in our business or changes in market conditions will not result in an impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets and the recognition of resulting expenses in future periods, which could adversely affect our results of operations for those periods.\nCompliance with changing regulations including specific program compliance, corporate governance and public disclosure will result in additional expenses and pose challenges for our management team.\nThe state agencies that contract for our services require our compliance with various rules and regulations affecting the services we provide. We have a compliance officer who monitors and reports on our efforts for achieving the desired results. State agencies are recommending increased rules and regulations in an effort to control the growth of these programs and their overall costs. The implementation of these changes may require the Company to increase their efforts to remain compliant, may reduce the authorizations for services to be provided, may result in certain consumers no longer being eligible for our services all of which may result in lower revenues and increased costs, reducing our operating performance and profitability. If we continue to serve our consumers without addressing these increased regulations we are at risk for non-compliance with program requirements and potential penalties.\nChanging laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and SEC regulations, have created uncertainty for public companies and significantly increased the costs and risks associated with accessing the U.S. public markets. We are committed to maintaining high standards of internal controls over financial reporting, corporate governance and public disclosure. As a result, we intend to continue to invest appropriate resources to comply with evolving standards, and this investment has resulted and will likely continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities.\nRestrictive covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness may adversely affect us.\nOur credit facility and the indentures governing our outstanding notes contain various covenants that limit our ability to take certain actions, including our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur, assume or guarantee additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\nissue redeemable stock and preferred stock;\n\u2022\nrepurchase capital stock;\n\u2022\nmake restricted payments, including paying dividends and making certain loans and investments;\n\u2022\nredeem debt that is subordinated in right of payment to our outstanding notes;\n\u2022\ncreate liens;\n\u2022\nsell or otherwise dispose of assets, including capital stock of subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nenter into agreements that restrict dividends and certain other payments from subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nmerge, consolidate, sell or otherwise dispose of substantially all our assets;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022\nguarantee certain obligations.\nIn addition, our credit facility contains restrictive covenants and requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests. Our ability to meet these restrictive covenants and financial ratios and tests may be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will meet those tests.\nA breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our credit facility and the indentures governing our outstanding notes. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under our credit facility or the indentures governing our outstanding notes, all amounts outstanding under our credit facility and our outstanding notes may become immediately due and payable and all commitments under the credit facility to extend further credit may be terminated. The acceleration of any such indebtedness will result in an event of default under all of our other long-term indebtedness.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile and this may adversely affect our stockholders.\nThe price at which our common stock trades may be volatile. The stock market has recently experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices of all securities, including securities of healthcare companies. The market price of our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:\n\u2022\nour operating and financial performance;\n\u2022\nvariances in our quarterly financial results compared to expectations;\n\u2022\nthe depth and liquidity of the market for our common stock;\n\u2022\nwe have a relatively small base of registered shares of common stock that could result in significant stock price movements upward or downward based on low levels of trading volume in our common stock;\n\u2022\nfuture sales of common stock or debt or the perception that sales could occur;\n\u2022\ninvestor perception of our business and our prospects;\n\u2022\ndevelopments relating to the occurrence of risks impacting our company, including any of the risk factors set forth herein; or\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and stock market conditions.\nIn addition, the stock market in general has experienced price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of homecare companies. These broad market and industry factors may materially reduce the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In the past, securities class-action litigation has often been brought against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their respective securities. We have been and may become involved in this type of litigation in the future. Litigation of this type is often expensive to defend and may divert our management team\u2019s attention as well as resources from the operation of our business.\nWe do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend solely on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nWe do not pay dividends on our shares of common stock and intend to retain all future earnings to finance the continued growth and development of our business and for general corporate purposes. In addition, we do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Any future payment of cash dividends will depend upon our financial condition, capital requirements, credit facility limitations, earnings and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. Our credit facility restricts our ability to declare or pay any dividend or other distribution unless no default then exists or would occur as a result thereof, we are in pro forma compliance with the financial covenants contained in the credit facility after giving effect thereto, we have an excess availability of at least 40% of the revolving credit commitment under the credit facility and the aggregate amount of dividends and distributions paid in any fiscal year does not exceed $5.0 million.\nIf securities or industry analysts fail to publish research or reports about our business or publish negative research or reports, or our results are below analysts\u2019 estimates, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock may depend in part on the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If analysts fail to publish reports on us regularly or at all, we could fail to gain visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. If one or more analysts do cover us and downgrade their evaluations of our stock or our results are below analysts\u2019 estimates, our stock price would likely decline. In addition, due to the small number of analysts covering us, a single comment or report from one of the analysts whether positive or negative, could result in a significant increase or decrease in our stock price.\nProvisions in our organizational documents and Delaware or certain other state laws could delay or prevent a change in control of our company, which could adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, could discourage, delay or prevent an unsolicited change in control of our company, which could adversely affect the price of our common stock. These provisions may also have the effect of making it more difficult for third parties to replace our current management without the consent of the board of directors. Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws that could delay or prevent an unsolicited change in control include:\n\u2022\na staggered board of directors;\n\u2022\nlimitations on persons authorized to call a special meeting of stockholders; and\n\u2022\nthe authorization of undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. This section generally prohibits us from engaging in mergers and other business combinations with stockholders that beneficially own 15% or more of our voting stock, or with their affiliates, unless our directors or stockholders approve the business combination in the prescribed manner. However, because the Eos Funds acquired their shares prior to our IPO, Section 203 is currently inapplicable to any business combination with the Eos Funds or their affiliates. In addition, our amended and restated bylaws require that any stockholder proposals or nominations for election to our board of directors must meet specific advance notice requirements and procedures, which make it more difficult for our stockholders to make proposals or director nominations. Certain states in which we operate, such as New York, may require regulatory approval of persons meeting such states\u2019 definition of \u201ccontrolling persons\u201d or similar concepts, which could delay or deter a change of control or other business combination with us.", "PERMNO": 93073, "SIC": 8082, "TIC": "ADUS"}
