Risk Factors\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following material risks, together with the other matters described in this Annual Report and in our financial statements and the related notes thereto in evaluating our current business and future performance. We cannot assure you that any of the events discussed in the risk factors below will not occur. If we are not able to successfully address any of the following risks or difficulties, we could experience significant changes in our business, operations and financial performance. In such circumstances, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and in some cases, such declines could be significant, and you could lose part or all of your investment. In addition to the risks described below, other unforeseeable risks and uncertainties or factors that we currently believe are immaterial may also adversely affect our operating results, and there may be other risks that may arise in the future. Certain statements contained in this Annual Report (including certain statements used in the discussion of our risk factors) constitute forward-looking statements. Please refer to the section entitled \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d appearing on page 2 of this Annual Report important limitations and guidelines regarding reliance on forward-looking statements.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe may not succeed in implementing our new business strategy.\nIn connection with the December 31, 2015 sale of substantially all of the assets of our industrial technology business to DuPont\u2019s Industrial Biosciences business for $75 million in cash (the \u201cDuPont Transaction\u201d), DuPont obtained certain rights to utilize the C1 technology for development and production of pharmaceutical products, for which it will make royalty payments to Dyadic upon commercialization. At the same time, Dyadic retained the co-exclusive rights to the C1 technology for use in all human and animal pharmaceutical applications, with Dyadic currently having exclusive ability to enter into sub-license agreements in that field (subject to the terms of the license and certain exceptions). We cannot predict whether DuPont intends to or will pursue the use of the C1 technology to develop or manufacture pharmaceutical products or whether or when we might receive royalties from DuPont. In certain circumstances, Dyadic may owe a royalty to either DuPont or certain licensors of DuPont, depending upon whether Dyadic elects to utilize certain patents owned or licensed in by DuPont. Consequently, our business has changed dramatically as compared to the past as we no longer have any product revenue related to our enzyme business. We have begun to apply the C1 technology in the biopharmaceutical market, which is relatively new to us. This change in our business makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and to predict our future operating results or financial performance.\nAs we attempt to adapt the C1 technology for use in the biopharmaceutical market, our business is subject to the execution, integration, and research and development risks that early-stage companies customarily face with new technologies, products and markets. These risks relate to, among other things, our ability to successfully further develop the C1 technology, products and processes, assemble and maintain adequate production and research and development (\u201cR&D\u201d) capabilities, comply with regulatory requirements, construct effective channels of distribution and manage growth. We have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by early stage companies in expanding and upgrading our intellectual property, regulatory, marketing, sales and R&D capabilities, improving our accounting and financial reporting and internal controls infrastructure, and adapting to the rapidly evolving industries in which we operate. Additionally, we are subject to competition from much larger companies with more resources than us. Also, the market for developing and manufacturing pharmaceutical proteins produced from a filamentous fungus, such as the C1 fungus, is a market that is not yet established and is subject to a high level of regulatory hurdles from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the \u201cFDA\u201d) and other governmental bodies and there is a risk that such technologies will not be adopted by the pharmaceutical industry or governmental agencies and therefore not succeed and/or not grow at the rates projected or at all.\nWe have not yet commercialized any products for the biopharmaceutical market, and we may never be able to do so. Other than certain members of our board of directors, we currently have neither qualified personnel with experience or expertise in research and development of biopharmaceutical products nor personnel with regulatory, manufacturing, marketing, sales and licensing experience in these areas.\nWe do not know when or if we and/or our current and/or future collaborators and licensees will complete any of our or their product development efforts, obtain regulatory approval for any product candidates incorporating our technologies or successfully commercialize any approved products. Even if we and/or our licensees and collaborators are successful in developing products that are approved for marketing, we and they will still require that these products gain regulatory approval and market acceptance. The biopharmaceutical industry is a high-risk industry in that even if we are successful at expressing certain proteins, these proteins may fail to be advanced or approved for use or sale for many reasons including their characteristics, biological activity, bio comparability, bio similarity, stability, glycosylation structures, containments, purity, performance, safety and regulatory reasons.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with pharmaceutical product development, we are unable to predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when, or if, we will be able to achieve certain technology, product and/or commercial milestones, access fees and royalties, launch products and/or processes, or achieve profitability. In addition, our expenses could increase if we are required by the FDA or other domestic and foreign regulatory authorities to perform studies or trials in addition to those currently expected, or if there are delays in completing additional safety studies such as toxicology and pathogenicity studies, clinical trials, preclinical studies, animal or human studies or the development of any of our or our collaborators\u2019 product candidates.\nAs a result of the evolving nature of our business, our operating history in past periods will not provide a reliable basis to evaluate our current business or predict our future performance. Any assessments of our current business or predictions regarding our future success or viability are likely not as accurate as they could be if we had a longer operating history in our new line of business.\nWe have a history of net losses, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we have an accumulated deficit of approximately $33.0 million. Prior to the DuPont Transaction, our revenues were derived from licensing, licensing milestones and a very small amount of royalties from the licensing of the C1 expression system to third parties mainly within the industrial biotechnology markets, the operation of our industrial enzyme business and the collection of R&D fees from third parties. Our profitability has strongly relied on, and will be even more reliant going forward on, third party industry and government research funding, licensing partnerships and other forms of collaborations. We believe that it is likely that if we do not sign license agreements or other forms of collaborations, we will incur losses because of our planned levels of R&D and additional general and administrative expenditures that we believe is necessary to operate our business and further develop the C1 technology for use in the pharmaceutical business. The amount of our future net losses will depend, in part, on the rate of increase in our expenses along with other potential cost of unforeseen circumstances, our ability to generate research funding, government grants, receipt of access fees, milestones, royalty and other payments, and whether we are able to generate revenues by entering into license agreements or other forms of collaborations, launch new products and/or processes from future licensees or collaborators, and our ability to raise additional capital. The net losses we anticipate incurring over the next several years will have an adverse effect on our stockholders\u2019 equity and working capital.\nThe R&D efforts needed to enhance and leverage the C1 technology for use in developing and manufacturing human and animal biopharmaceuticals, metabolites and viral vectors such as AAV, will require significant funding and increased staffing; therefore, we expect near-term operating and research expenses to continue, and maybe even accelerate, as we further develop our research and business plans, and our goals and objectives. Consequently, we will require significant additional revenue to achieve profitability. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to generate any revenues from our focus and efforts as we intend to apply the C1 technology into the biopharmaceutical industry. If we fail to enter into new license agreements or other forms of collaborations or generate revenues and profit from additional research projects and government grants, the market price of our common stock will likely decrease. Further regulatory complications, competition from other technologies, or delays in our research programs and the adoption and use of the C1 technology by the biopharmaceutical industry may force us to reduce our staffing and research and development efforts, which may further affect our ability to generate cash flow.\nWe are dependent on collaborations with third parties and if we fail to maintain or successfully manage existing, or enter into new, strategic collaborations, we may not be able to develop and commercialize many of our technologies and products and achieve profitability. We have a small number of research collaborations, and the nonperformance or loss of any collaboration could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur R&D revenue is generated from a relatively small number of research collaborations. These collaborations could be delayed or be discontinued, as they have in the past, at any time with little advance notice. We expect it to take a period of time before we will be successful, if at all, in obtaining additional research funding from industry and/or governmental sources. Therefore, for the time being, most of the research funding to further technology and product development will be incurred directly by the Company without any expense reimbursement from existing or new licensees and collaborators. If these research collaborations\nare lost or do not perform as expected, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur ability to enter into, maintain and manage collaborations in our target markets is fundamental to the success of our business. We currently rely on, and expect to continue to rely on, our current and future partners, in part, for research and development, manufacturing and distribution, sales and marketing services, and application and regulatory know how. In addition, we intend to enter into additional collaborations to conduct research, develop, produce, market, license and sell our technologies and products and processes we anticipate developing. However, we may not be successful in entering into collaborative arrangements with third parties. Any failure to enter into such arrangements on favorable terms could delay or hinder our ability to develop and commercialize our technologies, products and processes and could increase our costs of research and development and commercialization.\nWe have limited or no control over the resources that any collaborator or licensee may devote to our programs.\nAny of our current or future collaborators or licensees may, breach or terminate their agreements with us or otherwise fail to perform and conduct their required activities successfully and in a timely manner. Our collaborators or licensees may elect not to develop products arising out of our collaborative or license arrangements or may choose not to devote sufficient resources to the development, manufacture, market or sale of these products. If any of these events occur, we or our collaborators or licensees may not develop our technologies or commercialize our or their products.\nReductions in collaborators\u2019 R&D budgets may affect our businesses.\nFluctuations in the R&D budgets of government agencies, our customers, licensees, collaborators and research partners could have a significant impact on the interest in and demand for our technology. Private R&D budgets fluctuate due to changes in available resources, consolidation in the pharmaceutical and other industries, spending priorities and institutional budgetary policies. Governmental agencies, which we periodically receive research funding from, also experience fluctuations in their R&D budgets, which may negatively impact our ability to receive funding from such agencies. Our businesses could be seriously damaged by significant decreases in life sciences and/or pharmaceutical R&D expenditures by government agencies and existing and potential partners.\nWe heavily rely on contracts with third-party contract research organizations (\u201cCROs\u201d) to conduct our research and development, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nAs a result of the DuPont Transaction, we no longer own a research and development laboratory and we became dependent upon the performance and research capacity of a number of third-party contract research organizations to conduct our research and development projects, which include services and programs in connection with the modification and enhancement of the Company\u2019s C1 expression platform and to support our business development efforts for C1\u2019s use in biopharmaceutical applications. The licensing and service arrangements with these third party CROs are not guaranteed to be renewed or continued on reasonable terms, if at all. The Company may be unable to maintain or expand its access to third party CROs to conduct our research projects. Failure to maintain and expand access to certain third party CROs could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s research projects, financial condition and operating results.\nWe are heavily dependent upon the availability and performance of third-party research organizations. If we require research capacity and/or capabilities and are unable to obtain it in sufficient quantity, and quality or at terms and conditions that are acceptable to the Company or our third party collaborators we may not be able to offer our technologies or products for license, or sale, or we may be required to make substantial capital investments to build out that capacity or to contract with other research organizations on terms that may be less favorable than our current arrangements. In addition, if we contract with other research organizations, we may experience delays of several months in qualifying them or in starting up research programs at these facilities, which could harm our relationships with our licensees, collaborators or customers and we may be required to make a capital investment in connection with these arrangements. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, revenues or operating results.\nAdditionally, if we were unsuccessful in retaining a contract research organization with the requisite experience and skills we require and were required to build our own research facility, it could take a year or longer before such owned research facility is able to be brought online to carry out the necessary technology and product development efforts of the Company. Any funding and resources we utilize to acquire or build internal research capabilities could be at the expense of other potentially more profitable opportunities.\nConflicts with the CROs, collaborators and/or licensees could harm our business.\nAn important part of our strategy includes involvement in proprietary research programs. We may pursue opportunities in the pharmaceutical field that could conflict with those of our collaborators and licensees. Moreover, disagreements with DuPont, our current and/or future CROs, collaborators or licensees could develop over rights to our intellectual property, over further licensing of our technologies to other parties in certain pharmaceutical fields, or over other reasons. Any conflict with DuPont, our current and/or future CROs, collaborators or licensees could reduce our ability to obtain future collaboration agreements and negatively impact our relationship with existing collaborators or licensees, which could reduce our revenues and profits.\nSome of our current and/or future CROs, collaborators and/or licensees could also become competitors in the future. Our current and/or future CROs, collaborators and/or licensees could develop competing technologies or products, preclude us from entering into collaborations or license agreements with their customers, could fail to obtain timely regulatory approvals, terminate their agreements with us prematurely or fail to devote sufficient resources to the development and commercialization of their technology and products and processes. Any of these developments could harm our technology development and value, product development efforts, revenue, profits and overall business.\nIf issues arise with our current and/or future CROs, collaborators and/or licensees, we will need to either commercialize products resulting from our proprietary programs directly or by licensing to other companies, which could cause us to lose revenue or incur losses. Similarly, we may lose revenue or incur losses if we are unable to license our technology to new licensees on commercially reasonable terms or are unable to develop the capability to market and sell products and processes on our own.\nWe rely on our collaborators and other third parties to deliver timely and accurate information in order to accurately report our financial results as required by law.\nWe need to receive timely, accurate and complete information from a number of third parties in order to accurately and timely report our financial results. We rely on third parties to provide us with complete and accurate information regarding research developments and data, revenues, expenses and payments owed to or by us on a timely basis. We will need to establish the proper controls related to obtaining and reporting information from our CROs, licensees and collaborators related to research results and other data, when milestones are earned, if any, when royalties are earned, if any, as well as other types of potential revenues and expenses. If the information that we receive is not accurate, our consolidated financial statements may be materially incorrect and may require restatement. Although we may have contractual rights to receive information, such provisions may not ensure that we receive information that is accurate or timely. As a result, we may have difficulty in completing accurate and timely financial disclosures, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and the market price of our common stock.\nIf our competitors develop technologies and products more quickly and market more effectively than our product candidates, our commercial opportunity will be reduced or eliminated. Because of the competition and safety risks in the biopharmaceutical industry, any product candidates are subject to extensive regulation, which are costly and time consuming.\nAny biopharmaceutical products we or our current or collaborators or licensees develop through the C1 expression system will compete in highly competitive and regulated markets. Many of the organizations competing with us in the market for such products have more capital resources, larger R&D and marketing staff, facilities and capabilities, and greater experience in research and development, regulatory approval, manufacturing and commercialization of technology and products. Accordingly, our competitors may be able to develop technologies and products more rapidly. If a competitor develops superior technology or products, or more cost-effective alternatives to our and our collaborators\u2019 or licensees\u2019 technologies, products or processes, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCustomers may prefer existing or future technologies over the C1 expression system. Well-known and highly competitive biotechnology companies offer comparable or alternative technologies for the same products and services as our biopharmaceutical business. We anticipate that we, and our current or future collaborators and licensees will continue to encounter increased competition as new companies enter these markets and as the development of biological processes and products evolve.\nPharmaceutical companies are usually more focused on the qualitative and safety aspects of the products rather than on the actual cost or potential cost savings of producing such safe pharmaceutical products. It is expected to be a very difficult task, and it is expected to take a very long time to get the biopharmaceutical industry to adopt a new expression system, including the C1 expression system. Even if the C1 technology delivers on its promise of expressing high volumes of low-cost proteins with the proper qualitative properties without negative side effects, it is still expected to take a very long time, if ever, to obtain adoption and use of the C1 expression system by both the pharmaceutical industry and governmental regulatory agencies.\nWe could fail to manage our growth, which would impair our business.\nWe will need to take the following steps, among others, to manage our growth. If we fail to achieve one or more of these, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022\nBalance our cash burn with technology and product development, advancement and value creation of such technologies and products;\n\u2022\nMaintain and gain additional CROs, or other technology collaborators;\n\u2022\nMaintain and gain additional collaborators, strategic partners technology licensees or other forms of structures;\n\u2022\nFile, maintain and defend our intellectual property and protect our proprietary information and trade secrets;\n\u2022\nDevelop technology, products and processes that do not infringe on the intellectual property of third parties;\n\u2022\nRecruit, hire and maintain the required employees necessary to maintain and grow our business and to advance our technologies and products;\n\u2022\nAchieve technical and commercial success in our and our licensees\u2019 or collaborators\u2019 research and product development programs;\n\u2022\nImplement and oversee our operational and financial control systems;\n\u2022\nOperate successful recruiting and training programs;\n\u2022\nAccess the required manufacturing capacity;\n\u2022\nAccess additional growth capital;\n\u2022\nRecruit and maintain consultants, board members and scientific advisory board members;\n\u2022\nManage scientific risks and uncertainties that may arise during our R&D and regulatory programs; and\n\u2022\nLimit litigation risks and uncertainties.\nOur revenue growth depends in part on market and regulatory acceptance of the C1 technology to develop and manufacture animal and/or human biopharmaceutical products.\nThe success of our biopharmaceutical business will depend on our ability to develop, register, and introduce similar, new and improved technologies and products in a timely manner, at significantly lower manufacturing costs that address the evolving requirements of the pharmaceutical industry and potential customers. There is no assurance that the C1 technology or any product expressed from C1 will perform the same or better, save our customers money relative to existing gene expression technologies or those of our competitors, provide our customers with other benefits, obtain governmental safety and regulatory approvals, be registered or will gain market acceptance. If we fail to develop similar, new and better performing technologies, products and processes at significantly lower manufacturing costs, make fermentation yield improvements on our existing production processes, generate the necessary safety and regulatory data or gain registration and market acceptance of the C1 technology and C1 expressed products or processes, we could fail to recoup our R&D investment and fail to capitalize on potential opportunities or gain market share from our competitors. Any failure, for technological, quality, safety, regulatory, or other reasons, to develop and launch improved technologies and new products, could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe dynamic and conservative nature of the biopharmaceutical industry, the unpredictable nature of the product development process and the time and cost of new technology adoption in the biopharmaceutical industry may affect our ability to meet the requirements of the marketplace or achieve market and/or regulatory acceptance. Some factors affecting market and regulatory acceptance of our technologies and products include:\n\u2022\nAvailability, quality, performance and price of competitive products and processes;\n\u2022\nFunctionality and cost of similar, new and existing technologies and products;\n\u2022\nTiming of product introduction, performance and pricing compared to our competitors;\n\u2022\nScientists\u2019, customers\u2019 and regulatory agencies\u2019 opinions of our technology and products\u2019 utility and our ability to effectively incorporate their feedback into future technology development or product offerings;\n\u2022\nThe status of C1 and other expression technologies including CHO, E.coli, other microbial, insect, algae, plant and other expression systems as to safety, quality, purity and expression levels, capital expenditure intensity, operating costs, and continually changing governmental and industry regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nThe impact of our own, DuPont\u2019s and our collaborators\u2019 intellectual property, and that of our competitors\n\u2022\nCompetition with and against much larger companies; and\n\u2022\nRegulatory hurdles, timing, costs and receipt of approvals.\nThe expenses or losses associated with unsuccessful technology and product development activities or lack of market acceptance of our new technologies and products could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe must continually offer new products and technologies.\nThe biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapid technological change, and the area of gene and protein research and platform development is a rapidly-evolving field. Our future success will depend on our ability to maintain a competitive position with respect to technological advances in terms of product and process quality, stability, safety, productivity and cost. Rapid technological development by others could cause our products and technologies to become obsolete and it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPotential future regulations limiting our ability to sell genetically engineered products could harm our business.\nWe, our current and future collaborators and licensees expect to develop biologic products using genetically engineered microorganisms (GMOs). Products derived from GMOs may in some instances be subject to bans or additional regulation by federal, state, local and foreign government agencies. These agencies may not allow us or our collaborators and licensees to produce and market products derived from GMOs in a timely manner or under technically or commercially feasible conditions.\nCompliance with FDA, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and EU regulations could result in expenses, delays or other impediments to our product development programs or the commercialization of resulting products. The FDA currently applies the same regulatory standards to products made through genetic engineering as those applied to products developed through traditional methodologies. Regardless of GMO status, a product may be subject to lengthy FDA reviews and unfavorable FDA determinations due to safety concerns or changes in the FDA\u2019s regulatory policy. The EPA regulates biologically-derived enzyme-related chemical substances not within the FDA\u2019s jurisdiction. An unfavorable EPA ruling could delay commercialization or require modification of the production process or product in question, resulting in higher manufacturing costs, thereby making the product uneconomical. The EU and other countries also have regulations regarding the development, production and marketing of products from GMOs, which may be as or more restrictive than U.S. regulations.\nFurther, we, DuPont, our current and future collaborators and licensees are subject to regulations in the other countries in which we operate outside of the U.S. and EU, which may have different rules and regulations depending on the jurisdiction. Different countries have different rules regarding which products qualify as GMO. If any of these countries expand the definition of GMO and increase the regulatory burden on GMO products, our business could be harmed.\nOther changes in regulatory requirements, laws and policies, or evolving interpretations of existing regulatory requirements, laws and policies, may result in increased compliance costs, delays, capital expenditures and other financial obligations that could adversely affect our business or financial results.\nPublic views on ethical and social issues may limit use of our technologies.\nOur success will depend in part upon our ability, our current and future collaborators\u2019 or licensees\u2019 ability, to develop pharmaceutical products discovered, developed and manufactured through the C1 expression system. Governmental authorities could, for social, ethical or other purposes, limit the use of genetic processes or prohibit the practice of using a modified C1 organism to produce biologic vaccines, drugs and other biologic products. Concerns about the C1 expression system, and particularly about the expression of genes from C1 for pharmaceutical purposes, could adversely affect their market acceptance.\nThe commercial success of our current and future collaborations and our licensees\u2019 potential products will depend in part on public acceptance of the use of genetically engineered products including enzymes, vaccines, drugs and other protein products produced in this manner. Claims that genetically engineered products are unsafe for consumption or pose a danger to the environment, animals or humans may influence public attitudes. Our and our licensees\u2019 genetically engineered products may not gain public acceptance. Negative public reaction to GMOs and products could result in increased government regulation of genetic research and resulting products, including stricter labeling laws or other regulations, and could cause a decrease in the demand for our products. If we and/or our collaborators are not able to overcome the ethical, legal, and social concerns relating to genetic engineering, some or all of our products and processes may not gain public acceptance. Any of the considerations below could result in expenses, delays, or other impediments to our and our licensees\u2019 programs or the public acceptance and commercialization of products and processes dependent on our technologies and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations:\n\u2022\npublic attitudes about the safety and environmental hazards of, and ethical concerns over, genetic research and genetically engineered products and processes, which could influence public acceptance of our and our licensees\u2019 technologies, products and processes;\n\u2022\npublic attitudes regarding, and potential changes to laws governing, ownership of genetic material which could harm our intellectual property rights with respect to our genetic material and discourage collaborative partners or licensees from supporting, developing, or commercializing our products, processes and technologies; and\n\u2022\ngovernment regulations are changing rapidly, which likely will result in greater government regulation of genetic research and derivative technologies and products derived from such technologies, making approvals of such technologies and the products derived from such technologies to be delayed, more expensive with added risks.\nOur results of operations may be adversely affected by environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and liabilities.\nWe and the CROs, collaborators and licensees are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations relating to the discharge of materials into the air, water and ground, the generation, storage, handling, use, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials, and the health and safety of our employees. These laws, regulations and permits can often require expensive pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit actual or potential impacts to the environment. A violation of these laws and regulations or permit conditions can result in substantial fines, criminal sanctions, permit revocations and/or facility shutdowns.\nIn addition, new laws, new interpretations of existing laws, increased government enforcement of environmental laws, or other developments could require us or our contract research organizations to make additional significant expenditures. Present and future environmental laws and regulations and interpretations thereof, more vigorous enforcement of policies and discovery of currently unknown conditions may require substantial expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. Additionally, any such developments may have a negative impact on our contract manufacturers, which could harm our business.\nWe may fail to commercialize the C1 expression system for the expression of therapeutic proteins, antibodies and vaccines.\nWe have not yet developed any C1-based biopharmaceutical products, conducted the necessary safety, efficacy, cost and regulatory studies, or completed the commercialization of any therapeutic proteins, antibodies and vaccines.\nTo date, drug companies have developed and commercialized only a small number of gene-based products in comparison to the total number of drug molecules available in the marketplace. Our biopharmaceutical business should be evaluated as having the same risks as those inherent to early-stage biotechnology companies because the application of the C1 expression system for the expression of pre-clinical and clinical quantities of therapeutic proteins, antibodies and vaccines is still in early development.\nSuccessful development of the C1 expression system for biopharmaceutical purposes will require significant research, development and capital investment, including testing, to prove its safety, efficacy and cost-effectiveness. In general, our experience has been that each step in the process has been longer and costlier than originally projected, and we anticipate that this is likely to remain the case with respect to the continuing development efforts of our biopharmaceutical business.\nWe have no experience submitting applications to the FDA or similar regulatory authorities and could be subject to lengthy and/or unfavorable regulatory proceedings.\nWhile we understand that many of our current and future collaborators or licensees may have a proven track record of experience submitting application to the FDA or other applicable regulatory authorities, we have no such experience. Neither we\nnor any collaborator or licensee has yet submitted any application with the FDA or any other regulatory authority for any product candidate generated through the use of the C1 expression system as it relates to the development and manufacture of pharmaceutical products. The FDA may not have substantial experience with technology similar to ours, which could result in delays or regulatory action against us. We and our current and future collaborators and licensees may not be able to able to obtain regulatory approval for C1 expressed products, which would harm our business.\nThe C1 expression system has been tested for use in the manufacturing of an enzyme in the production of wine, beer and fruit juices, and has generated promising safety and toxicity data for that enzyme. The C1 expression system could produce vaccines, antibodies, or therapeutic products and enzymes that have safety, toxicity, pathogenicity, immunogenicity and other issues associated with them. The C1 expression system may be subject to lengthy regulatory reviews and unfavorable regulatory determinations if it raises safety questions which cannot be satisfactorily answered or if results from studies do not meet regulatory requirements. An unfavorable regulatory ruling could be difficult to resolve and could delay or possibly prevent a product from being commercialized, or even the use of the C1 technology to produce future products which would have a material adverse effect on our growth and prospects. Additionally, future products produced by us or our current and future collaborators or licensees using the C1 expression system may not be approved by the FDA or other regulatory agencies in the U.S. or worldwide. There is no assurance that safety, toxicity, pathogenicity, immunogenicity and other issues will not arise in current or future product development and manufacturing programs due to media, fermentation, inherent properties or genetic changes in the C1 strain and fermentation process.\nIf these therapeutic protein products, antibodies or vaccines are not approved by regulators, we or our current and future customers or collaborators and licensees will not be able to commercialize them, and we may not receive research funding, upfront license fees, milestone and royalty payments which are based upon the successful advancement of these products through the drug development and approval process. Even after investing significant time and expense, any regulatory approval may also impose limitations on the uses for which we can market a product, and any marketed product and its manufacturer are subject to continual review. Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or manufacturer may result in new restrictions on the product, manufacturer and manufacturing facility, including withdrawal of the product from the market. In certain countries, regulatory agencies also set or approve prices, which may result in low or unprofitable margins and would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAlternative technologies may not require microbial or other cell produced proteins.\nResearch is being conducted with cell or gene based therapies and other technologies that offer a possible alternative to producing proteins as they are today based on microbial, organic matter containing Carbon, Hydrogen, and Oxygen or other organisms, that may allow genes to be directly inserted into cells that can be implanted into animals and humans directly, displacing the need for the existing methods used for development of biologic vaccines and drugs. If they are successful, these new methods may supplant or greatly reduce the need for microorganisms, Carbon, Hydrogen, and Oxygen or other organisms to produce these proteins externally as the injected cells in animals and human may be able to do so internally.\nOther Business Risks That We Face\nWe may need substantial additional capital in the future to fund our business.\nOur future capital requirements may be substantial, particularly as we continue to further develop, engineer and optimize the C1 expression system and our other proprietary technologies, products and processes for licensing for research and development, and commercialization of potential animal and human pharmaceutical products.\nOur need for additional capital, if any, will depend on many factors, including (i) the technical and financial success of our efforts to enter the biopharmaceutical industry, (ii) the progress and scope of our collaborative and independent R&D projects and other ongoing and future potential projects, (iii) the receipt of future upfront fees, potential milestones, royalties and other payments from future licensees or other types of collaborations if any, (iv) our ability to obtain payments from other potential pharmaceutical business customers through research funding, milestones, license agreements and other forms of collaborative agreements, (v) the extent to which we can obtain licensees, or other types of collaborative partnerships for the research, development and commercialization of proteins in the biopharmaceutical industry, (vi) the effect of any acquisitions of other technologies and/or businesses that we may make in the future, and (vii) the filing, prosecution, enforcement and defense of patent claims and/or infringements by us, and our collaborators.\nWe currently have very little leverage and if our capital resources are insufficient to meet our capital requirements, we will have to raise additional funds to continue the development of our technologies and complete the development and commercialization of products, if any, resulting from our technologies. If the acquisition of additional funds is not possible or if\nwe engage in future equity financings, dilution to our existing stockholders may result. If we raise capital through debt financing, we may be subject to restrictive covenants that limit our ability to conduct our business. We may not be able to raise funds on terms that are favorable to us, if at all. If we fail to raise sufficient funds and incur losses, our ability to fund our operations, take advantage of strategic opportunities, develop products or technologies, or otherwise respond to competitive pressures could be significantly limited. If this happens, we may be forced to delay or terminate research or development programs or the commercialization of products resulting from our technologies, curtail or cease operations or obtain funds through collaborative and licensing arrangements that may require us to relinquish commercial rights, sell certain assets of the company which will limit future opportunities, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. Without sufficient funding or revenue, we may have to curtail, cease, or dispose of, one or more of our operations and would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and future prospects.\nChanges in global economic and financial markets may have a negative effect on our business.\nOur business is subject to a variety of market forces including, but not limited to, domestic and international economic, political and social conditions. Many of these forces are beyond our control. Any change in market conditions that negatively impacts our operations or the demand of our current or prospective customers could adversely affect our business operations.\nIn addition, changes in the global financial, pharmaceutical and biotech markets may make it difficult to accurately forecast operating results. These changes have had, and may continue to have, a negative effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. In the event of a downturn in global economic activity, current or potential business partners may go out of business, may be unable to fund purchases or determine to reduce purchases, all of which could lead to reduced demand for our products and increased payment delays or defaults. We are also limited in our ability to reduce costs to offset the results of a prolonged or severe economic downturn given certain fixed costs associated with our operations and difficulties if we over strained our resources. The timing and nature of a sustained recovery in the credit and financial markets remains uncertain, and there can be no assurance that market conditions will significantly improve in the near future or that our results will not continue to be materially and adversely affected.\nIf we lose key personnel, including key management or board members, or are unable to attract and retain additional personnel, it could delay our technology and product development programs, harm our R&D efforts, and we may be unable to pursue research funding, licenses and other forms of collaborations or develop our own products.\nOur planned activities will require retention and ongoing recruiting of additional expertise in specific areas applicable to our industries, technologies and products being developed. These activities will not only require the development of additional expertise by existing management personnel, but also the addition of new research and scientific, regulatory, licensing, sales, marketing, management, accounting and finance and other personnel. The inability to acquire or develop this expertise or the loss of principal members of our management, broad of directors, consultants, accounting and finance, sales, and scientific staff could impair the growth, if any, of our business. Competition for experienced personnel from numerous companies, academic institutions and other research facilities may limit our ability to attract and retain qualified management, directors, consultants, and scientific personnel on acceptable terms. Failure to attract and retain qualified personnel would inhibit our ability to maintain and pursue collaborations and develop our products and core technologies.\nPersonnel changes may disrupt our operations. Hiring and training new personnel will entail costs and may divert our resources and attention from revenue-generating efforts. In addition, we periodically engage consultants to assist us in our business and operations, these consultants operate as independent contractors, and we, therefore, do not have as much control over their activities as we do over the activities of our employees. Our directors and consultants may be affiliated with or employed by other parties, and some may have consulting or other advisory arrangements with other entities that may conflict or compete with their obligations to us.\nInability to protect our intellectual property could harm our ability to compete.\nOur success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patents and on our and DuPont\u2019s (as part of the DuPont Transaction, patents were assigned to DuPont) and our current and future collaborators\u2019 and licensees\u2019 ability to maintain adequate protection of our and their intellectual property. If we, DuPont, or our current and future collaborators and licensees do not adequately protect our intellectual property, competitors may be able to practice our technologies and erode our competitive advantage. The laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting their proprietary rights in these foreign countries.\nHowever, the patent positions of biotechnology companies, including our patent position, are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. We will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties\nonly to the extent that our, and in certain instances the C1 patents assigned to DuPont, and our current and future collaborators and licensees proprietary technologies are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets. We intend, from time to time, to apply for patents covering both our technologies and our products, while at other times, we only maintain such knowledge as trade secrets without applying for patents, as we deem appropriate. However, existing and future patent applications may be challenged and are not guaranteed to result in the issuing of patents. Even if a patent is obtained, it may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from practicing our technologies or from developing competing products. Others, including DuPont and our current and future collaborators and licensees, may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or design around our, DuPont\u2019s or our current and future collaborators\u2019 and licensees\u2019 patented technologies. In addition, DuPont, our current and future collaborators, licenses, or other third parties may challenge or invalidate our patents, or our patents may fail to provide us with any competitive advantages. If any third party is able to gain intellectual property protections for technology similar to our own, they may be successful in blocking us and our licensees from using C1 technology and/or commercializing products derived from the C1 technology.\nThe United States Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, enacted in September 2011, brought significant changes to the U.S. patent system, which include a change to a \u201cfirst to file\u201d system from a \u201cfirst to invent\u201d system and changes to the procedures for challenging issued patents and disputing patent applications during the examination process, among other things. The effects of these changes on our patent portfolio and business have yet to be determined, as the final substantive provisions of the America Invents Act took effect on March 16, 2013. The United States Patent and Trademark Office (the \u201cUSPTO\u201d), only recently finalized the rules relating to these changes and the courts have yet to address the new provisions. These changes could increase the costs and uncertainties surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our patent rights. Additional uncertainty may result from legal precedent handed down by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and United States Supreme Court as they determine legal issues concerning the scope and construction of patent claims and inconsistent interpretation of patent laws by the lower courts. Accordingly, we cannot ensure that any of our pending patent applications will result in issued patents, or even if issued, predict the breadth of the claims upheld in our and other companies\u2019 patents. Given that the degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain, we cannot ensure that we were the first to invent the inventions covered by our pending patent applications, or that we were the first to file patent applications for these inventions or the patents we have obtained.\nIn addition, Dyadic will continue to review its existing and potential patent positions and rights. Based on our analysis if and when the commercial opportunities and patent enforceability are questionable, we may abandon certain patents in some countries. There is a risk that we will abandon potentially valuable patents.\nLitigation or other proceedings or third-party claims of intellectual property infringement could require us to spend significant time and resources and could prevent us and our collaborators from commercializing our or their technologies and products or negatively impact our stock price.\nOur commercial success depends in part on neither infringing patents and proprietary rights of third parties, nor breaching any licenses that we have entered into with regard to our technologies and products. Others have filed, and in the future are likely to file, patent applications covering genes or gene fragments, genetic elements, screening, gene expression and fermentation processes and other intellectual property that we may wish to utilize with the C1 expression system or products and systems that are similar to those developed with its use. If these patent applications result in issued patents and we wish to use the claimed technology, we may need to obtain a license from the appropriate third party.\nThird parties may assert that we and/or our current and future collaborators and licensees are employing their proprietary technology without authorization. In addition, third parties may obtain patents in the future and claim that use of our technologies infringes these patents. We could incur substantial costs and diversion of management and technical personnel in defending ourselves against any of these claims or enforcing our patents and other intellectual property rights. Parties making claims against us may be able to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to further develop, commercialize and sell products, and could result in the award of substantial damages against us. If a claim of infringement against us is successful, we may be required to pay damages and obtain one or more licenses from third parties. In the event that we are unable to obtain these licenses at a reasonable cost, we and/or current and future collaborators and licensees could encounter delays in product commercialization while we attempt to develop alternative methods or products. Defense of any lawsuit or failure to obtain any of these licenses could prevent us from commercializing available products.\nIn addition, unauthorized parties may attempt to steal, copy or otherwise obtain and use our C1 microbial strains, genetic elements, development and manufacturing processes, other technology or products. Monitoring unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult, and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technologies, particularly in certain foreign countries where the local laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States. Moreover, third parties could practice our inventions in territories where we do not have patent protection. Such third parties may\nthen try to import into the United States or other territories products, or information leading to potentially competing products, made using our inventions in countries where we do not have patent protection for those inventions. If competitors are able to use our technologies, our ability and our current and future collaborators\u2019 and licensees\u2019 ability to compete effectively could be harmed. Moreover, others may independently develop and obtain patents for technologies that are similar to or superior to our technologies. If that happens, we may need to license these technologies, and we may not be able to obtain licenses on reasonable terms, if at all, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nConfidentiality agreements with employees and others may not adequately prevent disclosures of trade secrets and other proprietary information.\nWe rely in part on trade secret protection to protect our confidential and proprietary information and processes. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We have taken measures to protect our trade secrets and proprietary information, but these measures may not be effective. We require employees and consultants to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of an employment or consulting arrangement with us. These agreements generally require that all confidential information developed by the individual or made known to the individual by us during the course of the individual\u2019s relationship with us be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties. These agreements also generally provide that inventions conceived by the individual in the course of rendering services to us shall be our exclusive property. Nevertheless, our proprietary information may be disclosed, third parties could reverse engineer our biocatalysts and others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights, and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position.\nWe may be sued for product liability.\nWe or our current and future collaborators and licenses may be held liable if any product we or they develop, or any product which is made with the use or incorporation of, any of our technologies, causes injury or is found otherwise unsuitable or unsafe during product testing, manufacturing, marketing or sale. These claims could be brought by various parties, including other companies who purchase products from our current and future collaborators and licenses or by end users of the products.\nWhile we maintain product liability insurance, it may not fully cover all of our potential liabilities and our liability could in some cases exceed our total assets, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, or cause us to go out of business. Further, insurance coverage is expensive and may be difficult to obtain and may not be available to us or to our collaborators and licensees in the future on acceptable terms, or at all. Inability to obtain sufficient insurance coverage at an acceptable cost to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of products developed by us, or our collaborators and licensees.\nForeign currency fluctuations could adversely affect our results.\nIn the conduct of our business, in certain instances, we are required to receive payments or pay our obligations in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Especially since a large portion of our research and development is done in the EU and the CROs and certain consultants request payments in Euros. As a result, we are exposed to changes in currency exchange rates with respect to our business transactions denominated in non-US dollars.\nFluctuations in currency exchange rates have in the past and may in the future negatively affect our revenue, expenses and our financial position and results of operations as expressed in U.S. dollars. Our management monitors foreign currency exposures and may in the ordinary course of business enter into foreign currency forward contracts or options contracts related to specific foreign currency transactions or anticipated cash flows. We do not hedge and have no current plans to hedge in the future, the translation of financial statements of consolidated subsidiaries whose local books and records are maintained in foreign currency.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards (\u201cNOLs\u201d) to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\nIn general, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its NOLs, to offset future taxable income. If the Internal Revenue Service challenges our analysis that our existing NOLs are not subject to limitations arising from previous ownership changes, our ability to utilize NOLs could be limited by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. Future changes in our stock ownership, some of which are outside of our control, could result in an ownership change under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. Furthermore, our ability to utilize NOLs of companies that we may acquire in the future may be subject to limitations.\nWe may make acquisitions, investments and strategic alliances that may use significant resources, result in disruptions to our business or distractions of our management, may not proceed as planned, and could expose us to unforeseen liabilities.\nWe may seek to expand our business through the acquisition of, investment in and strategic alliances with companies, technologies, products, and services. If we are able to identify suitable acquisition, investment or strategic alliance targets, we may be unable to negotiate successfully their acquisition at a price or on terms and conditions acceptable to us. Acquisition, investments and strategic alliances involve a number of risks, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe potential adverse effect on our cash position as a result of all or a portion of an acquisition, investment or strategic alliance purchase price being paid in cash;\n\u2022\nthe potential issuance of securities that would dilute our stockholders\u2019 percentage ownership;\n\u2022\nunanticipated costs and liabilities, including the potential to incur restructuring and other related expenses, including significant transaction costs that may be incurred regardless of whether a potential strategic alliance, acquisition or investment is completed;\n\u2022\nthe ability to effectively and quickly assimilate the operations, technologies, products and services or products of the acquired company or business;\n\u2022\nthe ability to integrate acquired personnel;\n\u2022\nthe ability to oversee, retain and motivate key employees;\n\u2022\nthe ability to retain customers;\n\u2022\nminimizing the diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns; and\n\u2022\npotential loss of invested capital.\nWe cannot assure you that, following an acquisition, investment or strategic alliance, we will achieve expected research and development results, anticipated synergies, revenues, specific net income or loss levels that justify such transaction or that the transaction will result in increased earnings, or reduced losses, for the combined company in any future period. Moreover, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing to acquire any businesses or to provide funding for such business, which would result in dilution for stockholders or the incurrence of indebtedness and may not be available on terms which would otherwise be acceptable to us. We may not be able to oversee such investment(s) nor operate acquired businesses profitably or otherwise implement our growth strategy successfully.\nWe rely significantly on information technology and any failure, inadequacy, interruption or security lapse of that technology, including any cybersecurity incidents, could harm our ability to operate our business effectively.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of third parties with which we contract are vulnerable to damage from cyber-attacks, computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. System failures, accidents or security breaches could cause interruptions in our operations and could result in a material disruption of our research activities and business operations, in addition to possibly requiring substantial expenditures of resources to remedy. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and delays in our research efforts and financial reporting compliance, as well as significant increase in costs to recover or reproduce the data.\nRisks Related to Our Stock Repurchase Program\nOur stock repurchase program may be extended, suspended or discontinued at any time, which could cause the price of our common stock to be volatile or to decrease.\nOn February 16, 2016, the Board of Directors authorized a one-year stock repurchase program, under which the Company was authorized to repurchase up to $15 million of its outstanding common stock (the \u201c2016 Stock Repurchase Program\u201d). The 2016 Stock Repurchase Program ended on February 15, 2017.\nOn August 16, 2017, the Board of Directors authorized a new one-year stock repurchase program, under which the Company may repurchase up to $5 million of its outstanding common stock (the \u201c2017 Stock Repurchase Program\u201d). On August 6, 2018, the Board of Directors authorized an extension of this stock repurchase program through August 15, 2019. Please refer to our consolidated financial statements note under \u201cShareholders\u2019 Equity - Share Repurchases and Buybacks\u201d for share repurchases and buyback information and activities.\nUnder the 2017 Stock Repurchase Program, the Company is authorized to repurchase shares in open-market purchases in accordance with all applicable securities laws and regulations, including Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The extent to which the Company repurchases its shares, and the timing of such repurchases, is dependent upon a variety of factors, including market conditions, regulatory requirements and other corporate considerations, as determined by the Company\u2019s management. The repurchase program may be extended, suspended or discontinued at any time. The Company expects to finance the program from its existing cash resources. All repurchased shares are held in treasury. However, the board may decide to retire these shares in the future.\nIn addition to the Stock Repurchase Programs above, our Board of Directors may, on a case by case basis, authorize the repurchase of the Company\u2019s shares in privately negotiated transactions, if such transaction is in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders.\nThe Company may in the future determine to initiate a new repurchase program depending upon a variety of factors, including market conditions, regulatory requirements and other corporate considerations, as determined by the Company\u2019s Board of Directors and management.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe price of our shares of common stock is likely to be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, volatile. Biotechnology company stocks generally tend to experience extreme price fluctuations. The valuations of many biotechnology companies without consistent product sales and earnings are extraordinarily high based on conventional valuation standards such as price-to-earnings and price-to-sales ratios. These trading prices and valuations may not be sustained. Factors that may result in fluctuations in our stock price include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nChanges in the public\u2019s perception of the prospects of biotechnology companies.\n\u2022\nBroad market and industry factors including market fluctuations or political and economic conditions such as war, recession or changes in interest and currency rates.\n\u2022\nAnnouncements of new technological innovations, patents or new products or processes by us, DuPont or our current or future collaborators, licensees and competitors;\n\u2022\nAnnouncements by us, DuPont or our collaborators and licensees relating to our relationships or either of our relationships with other third parties;\n\u2022\nCoverage of, or changes in financial estimates by us or securities analysts;\n\u2022\nConditions or trends in the biotechnology industry;\n\u2022\nChanges in the market valuations of other biotechnology companies;\n\u2022\nLimitations or expanded uses in the areas within the biopharmaceutical or other industries into which we can apply our technologies and products;\n\u2022\nActual or anticipated changes in our growth rate relative to our competitors;\n\u2022\nDevelopments in domestic and international governmental policy or regulations;\n\u2022\nAnnouncements by us, DuPont, our current and future collaborators and licenses, or our competitors of significant acquisitions, divestures, strategic partnerships, license agreements, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nThe position of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities;\n\u2022\nAny changes in our debt position;\n\u2022\nDevelopments in patent or other proprietary rights held by us, DuPont or by others;\n\u2022\nNegative effects related to the stock or business performance of DuPont, our current and future collaborators and licensees, or the abandonment of projects using our technology by our collaborators and/or licensees;\n\u2022\nScientific risks inherent to emerging technologies such as the C1 expression system;\n\u2022\nSet-backs, and/or failures, and or delays in our or our current and future collaborators\u2019 and licensees\u2019 R&D and commercialization programs;\n\u2022\nDelays or failure to receive regulatory approvals by us, DuPont and/or our current and future collaborators and licensees;\n\u2022\nLoss or expiration of our or DuPont\u2019s intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nLawsuits initiated by or against us, DuPont, or our current and future collaborators and licensees;\n\u2022\nPeriod-to-period fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nFuture royalties from product sales, if any, by DuPont, our current or future strategic partners, collaborators or licensees;\n\u2022\nFuture royalties may be owed to DuPont by us, our collaborators, licenses, or sub-licensees under certain circumstances related to our DuPont Pharma License;\n\u2022\nSales of our common stock or other securities in the open market;\n\u2022\nStock buy-back programs;\n\u2022\nStock splits and reverse stock split;\n\u2022\nDecisions made by the board related to potential registration of Dyadic\u2019s stock under the Securities Act of 1933, and/or up listing to another stock exchange.\nVolatile stock prices can lead to securities class action litigation. In 2007, a stockholder filed a securities class action suit against us, which we settled on July 27, 2010. If we were to become party to another securities class action suit, we could incur substantial legal fees and our management\u2019s attention and resources could be diverted from operating our business to responding to litigation.\nOur quarterly and annual operating results may be volatile.\nOur quarterly and annual operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to do so in the future. These fluctuations could cause our stock price to vary significantly or decline. Some of the factors that could impact our operating results include:\n\u2022\nExpiration of or cancellations of our research contracts with current and future collaborators and/or licensees, which may not be renewed or replaced;\n\u2022\nSetbacks or failures in our and our current and future collaborators and licensees research, development and commercialization efforts;\n\u2022\nSetbacks, or delays in our research and development efforts to develop and produce biologics.\n\u2022\nSetbacks, or delays in our research and development efforts to re-engineer the C1 technology for its application and use in developing and producing biologics.\n\u2022\nThe speed, and success rate of our discovery and research and development efforts leading to potential licenses, or other forms of collaborations, access fees, milestones and royalties;\n\u2022\nThe timing and willingness of current and future collaborators and licensees to utilize C1 to develop and commercialize their products which would result in potential upfront fees, milestones and royalties;\n\u2022\nGeneral and industry specific economic conditions, which may affect our current and future collaborators\u2019 and licensees\u2019 R&D expenditures;\n\u2022\nThe adoption and acceptance of the C1 expression system by biopharmaceutical companies and regulatory agencies;\n\u2022\nThe addition or loss of one or more of the collaborative partners, grants, research funding, or licensees we are working with to further develop and commercialize our technologies and products in the pharmaceutical industry;\n\u2022\nOur ability to file, maintain and defend our intellectual property and to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets;\n\u2022\nOur ability to develop technology, products and processes that do not infringe on the intellectual property of third parties;\n\u2022\nThe improvement and advances made by our competitors to CHO, E.coli, yeast, inset cells, plant and other expression systems;\n\u2022\nThe introduction by our competitors of new discovery and expression technologies competitive with the C1technology;\n\u2022\nOur ability to enter into new research projects, grants, licenses or other forms of collaborations and generate revenue from such parties;\n\u2022\nScientific risk associated with emerging technologies such as the C1 expression system;\n\u2022\nFailure to bring on the necessary research, CMO, CDMO and manufacturing capacity if required;\n\u2022\nUncertainty regarding the timing of research funding, grants or upfront license fees for new C1 expression system collaborations, license agreements or expanded license agreements;\n\u2022\nDelays or failure to receive upfront fees, milestones and royalties and other payments.\nA large portion of our expenses are relatively fixed, including expenses for personnel. Accordingly, if revenues do not grow as anticipated due to the expiration of research contracts or government research grants, the failure to obtain new contracts, licensees or other forms of collaborations or other factors, we may not be able to correspondingly reduce our operating expenses. Failure to achieve anticipated levels of revenue could, therefore, significantly harm our operating results for a particular fiscal period or for even prolonged periods of time.\nDue to the possibility of fluctuations in our revenues and expenses, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily a good indication of our future performance. Our operating results in some quarters, or even in some years may not meet the expectations of stock market analysts and investors, potentially causing our stock price to possibly decline.\nWe do not expect to pay cash dividends in the future.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on our stock and do not anticipate paying any dividends for the foreseeable future. The payment of dividends on our shares, if ever, will depend on our earnings, financial condition and other business and economic factors deemed relevant for consideration by our board of directors. If we do not pay dividends, our stock may be less valuable because a return on investment will only occur if and to the extent that our stock price appreciates.\nOur anti-takeover defense provisions may deter potential acquirers and depress our stock price.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and Delaware law, as well as certain agreements we have with our executives, could make it substantially more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us. These provisions include the following:\n\u2022\nWe may issue preferred stock with rights senior to those of our common stock;\n\u2022\nWe have a classified board of directors;\n\u2022\nAction by written consent by stockholders is not permitted;\n\u2022\nOur board of directors has the exclusive right to fill vacancies and set the number of directors;\n\u2022\nCumulative voting by our stockholders is not allowed; and\n\u2022\nWe require advance notice for nomination of directors by our stockholders and for stockholder proposals.\nThese provisions may discourage certain types of transactions involving an actual or potential change in control. These provisions may also limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests and discourage transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over the current market price.\nOur bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware) will be the sole and exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders' ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.\nOur bylaws, provide that unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware) shall be the sole and exclusive forum for (A) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company, (B) any action or proceeding asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer, employee or agent of the Company to the Company or the Company\u2019s stockholders, (C) any action or proceeding asserting a claim against the Company arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law or the Company\u2019s Certificate of Incorporation or bylaws, or (D) any action or proceeding asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in each case subject to said Court of Chancery having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants therein. The choice of forum provision does not apply to any actions arising under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act. The choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder's ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and other employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nConcentration of ownership among our existing officers, directors and principal stockholders may prevent other stockholders from influencing significant corporate decisions and depress our stock price.\nOur executive officers, directors and principal stockholders (5% stockholders) together control approximately 46.6% of our 26,713,486 shares of outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2018.\nOur Founder and Chief Executive Officer Mark Emalfarb, through the Mark A. Emalfarb Trust U/A/D October 1, 1987, as amended (the \u201cMAE Trust\u201d) of which he is the trustee and beneficiary, owned approximately 15.4% of our outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2018. Further, the Francisco Trust U/A/D February 28, 1996 (the \u201cFrancisco Trust\u201d), whose beneficiaries are the descendants and spouse of Mr. Emalfarb, owned approximately 14.2% of our outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2018. We have historically been partially controlled, managed and partially funded by Mr. Emalfarb, and affiliates of Mr. Emalfarb. Collectively, Mr. Emalfarb and stockholders affiliated with Mr. Emalfarb controlled approximately 29.6% of our outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2018.\nMr. Emalfarb may be able to control or significantly influence all matters requiring approval by our shareholders, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions. The interests of Mr. Emalfarb may not always coincide with the interests of other shareholders, and he may take actions that advance his personal interests and are contrary to the desires of our other shareholders.\nIf our existing officers, directors and principal stockholders act together, they will be able to exert a significant degree of influence over our management and affairs and over matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. In addition, this concentration of ownership may delay or prevent a change in control and might affect the market price of our shares, even when a change may be in the best interests of all stockholders. Certain of our principal stockholders may elect to increase their holdings of our common stock, which may have the impact of delaying or preventing a change of control. Moreover, the interests of this concentration of ownership may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders, and, accordingly, they could cause us to enter into transactions or agreements, which we would not otherwise consider.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not commence the publication of research or reports about our business, or publish negative reports about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We have no control over these analysts. If one or more analysts release a negative report or release a positive report and subsequently downgrade or change that report, potentially causing our stock price would likely decline. Additionally, if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our Company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nFuture issuances of shares of our common stock may negatively affect our stock price.\nThe sale of additional shares of our common stock, or the perception that such sales could occur, could harm the prevailing market price of shares of our common stock. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate.\nAs of December 31, 2018, there were 26,713,486 shares of our common stock outstanding. Approximately 46.6% of these outstanding common shares are beneficially owned or controlled by our executive officers, directors and principal stockholders. Shares held by our affiliates and certain of our directors, officers and employees are \u201crestricted securities\u201d as defined by Rule 144 (\u201cRule 144\u201d) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d) and subject to certain restrictions on resale. Restricted securities may be sold in the public market only if they are registered under the Securities Act or are sold pursuant to an exemption from registration such as Rule 144.\nOur common stock has a relatively small public float. As a result, sales of substantial amounts of shares of our common stock, or even the potential for such sales, may materially and adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock. In addition, any adverse effect on the market price of our common stock could make it difficult for us to raise additional capital through sales of equity securities.\nWe are a listing company on the OTCQX U.S. Premier marketplace, which may limit investors\u2019 ability to dispose of shares.\nOur common shares are currently quoted on the OTCQX U.S. Premier marketplace. Although we have applied for listing on the NASDAQ Stock Market Exchange, we have not yet cleared the NASDAQ staff questions. We may not be able to meet the\ninitial listing standards of NASDAQ or any other stock exchange, correctly predict the timing of such listing or, if listed, maintain such a listing. During the period that our common stock is quoted on the OTCQX U.S. Premier or any other over-the-counter system, an investor may find it more difficult to dispose of shares or obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of our common stock than would be the case if and when we list on the NASDAQ Stock Market or another U.S. or foreign stock exchange.\nWe will incur significant costs as a result of operating as an SEC registrant, and our management will be required to devote substantial time to compliance initiatives.\nAs an SEC registrant, we will incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses. In addition, the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as well as related rules implemented by the SEC, impose various requirements that require our management and other personnel to devote a substantial amount of time to compliance initiatives.\nIn addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. In particular, we must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal controls over financial reporting to allow management to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Our compliance with Section 404 requires that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management time on compliance-related issues. Moreover, if we are not able to maintain compliance with the requirements of Section 404, our stock price could decline, and we could face sanctions or investigation or investigations or other material adverse effects on our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.\nBecause we became a reporting company under the Exchange Act by means other than a traditional underwritten initial public offering, we may not be able to attract the attention of research analysts at major brokerage firms.\nBecause we did not become a reporting company by conducting an underwritten initial public offering, or IPO, of our common stock, and because we are not yet listed on a national securities exchange, security analysts of brokerage firms may not provide coverage of our company. In addition, investment banks may be less likely to agree to underwrite secondary offerings on our behalf than they might if we were to become a public reporting company by means of an IPO because they may be less familiar with our company as a result of more limited coverage by analysts and the media.\nRisks Related to the Potential Reverse Stock Split and Potential Listing on the NASDAQ or another National Stock Market\nThe potential Reverse Stock Split, if effected, would provide additional authorized shares for issuance by our Board of Directors, which could be used to frustrate any change in control or takeover transaction or have adverse consequences to our shareholders.\nIn April 2018, our Board of Directors approved for submission to a vote of our shareholders the grant of authority to the Board of Directors to amend our Certificate of Incorporation to effect the Reverse Stock Split at a ratio up to 1-for-4. At our annual shareholders meeting on June 6, 2018, our shareholders approved the proposal. If the Board of Directors effects the Reverse Stock Split, we would have additional authorized shares of common stock that the Board of Directors could issue in the future without shareholders\u2019 approval. Such additional shares could be issued, among other purposes, in financing transactions or to resist or frustrate a third-party transaction that is favored by a majority of the independent shareholders. This could have an anti-takeover effect, in that additional shares could be issued, within the limits imposed by applicable law, in one or more transactions that could make a change in control or takeover of us more difficult.\nA large number of available shares of common stock could have adverse consequences, including but not limited to, our current shareholders could be potentially diluted by future issuances of shares of common stock for capital raising purposes, to acquire additional assets, for equity compensation of officers and directors and for other corporate purposes.\nOur Board of Directors has not yet effected the potential Reverse Stock Split and even if effected, the Reverse Stock Split may not increase the price of our common stock and have other adverse consequences on the price of our common stock.\nOur Board of Directors has not yet effected the potential Reverse Stock Split. As part of the shareholder approval of the Reverse Stock Split, the Board of Directors reserved the right to abandon the Reverse Stock Split proposal without further action by our shareholders at any time before the effectiveness of the filing of the amended Certificate of Incorporation with the Delaware Secretary of State or delay (for up to 24 months after the annual meeting on June 6, 2018), if it determines, in its sole discretion, that such action is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. If the Board of Directors abandons or further delays\nthe Reverse Stock Split, the trading price of our common stock may be negatively affected. We cannot assure you, when or whether at all, the Board of Directors will effect the Reverse Stock Split.\nIf the Board of Directors effects the Reverse Stock Split, we expect that the Reverse Stock Split would increase the market price of our common stock. However, the effect of the Reverse Stock Split of our common stock upon the market price of our common stock cannot be predicted with certainty, and the results of reverse stock splits by companies in similar circumstances have been varied. The Reverse Stock Split could also be viewed negatively by the market and other factors, such as those described above, and therefore, may adversely affect the market price of the shares of our common stock. Consequently, the market price per post-Reverse Stock Split share may not increase in proportion to the reduction of the number of shares of our common stock outstanding before the implementation of the Reverse Stock Split. Accordingly, the total market capitalization of our shares of common stock after the Reverse Stock Split may be lower than the total market capitalization before the Reverse Stock Split.\nThe potential Reverse Stock Split could decrease the liquidity of our common stock.\nIf effected, the Reverse Stock Split could adversely affect the liquidity of our common stock given the dramatic reduction in the number of shares that will be outstanding after the Reverse Stock Split. In addition, the Reverse Stock Split could increase the number of shareholders who own odd lots (less than 100 shares) of our common stock, creating the potential for such shareholders to experience an increase in the cost of selling their shares and greater difficulty effecting such sales.\nEven after the potential Reverse Stock Split, the trading price of our common stock may not be high enough to attract new investors, including institutional investors, and may not satisfy the investing requirements of those investors or the NASDAQ or another national stock exchange that the company may seek to become listed on. Consequently, the trading liquidity of our common stock may not improve.\nEven if the Board of Directors effects the Reverse Stock Split, there can be no assurance that the Reverse Stock Split would result in a share price that will attract new investors, including institutional investors, or that the share price will satisfy the investing requirements of those investors or the NASDAQ or another national stock exchange that the company may seek to become listed on. Further, other factors, such as our financial results, market conditions and the market perception of our business, may adversely affect the interest of new investors in the shares of our common stock. As a result, the trading liquidity of our common stock may not necessarily improve, our share price may decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. We cannot assure you that any of the events discussed in the risk factors will not occur. If we are not able to successfully address any of the risks or difficulties, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial performance. In such circumstances, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and in some cases, such declines could be significant, and you could lose part or all of your investment. In addition to the risks, other unforeseeable risks and uncertainties that we currently believe are immaterial or unknown to us may also adversely affect our business, operating results or financial performance.", "PERMNO": 90682, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "DYAI"}
