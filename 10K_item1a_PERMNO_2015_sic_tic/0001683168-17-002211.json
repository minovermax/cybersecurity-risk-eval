{"cik": "1114925", "company": "LANTRONIX INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-08-24", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nWe operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves numerous risks and uncertainties. Before deciding to purchase, hold or sell our common stock, you should carefully consider the risks described in this section, as well as other information contained in this Report and in our other filings with the SEC. This section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto included in Item 8 of this Report, and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d included in Item 7 of this Report. If any of these risks or uncertainties actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could be materially harmed. In that event, the market price for our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment. In addition, risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business.\nCertain of our products are sold into mature markets, which could limit our ability to continue to generate revenue from these products. Our ability to sustain and grow our business depends on our ability to develop, market, and sell new products.\nCertain of our products are sold into mature markets that are characterized by a trend of declining demand. As the overall market for these products decreases due to the adoption of new technologies, we expect that our revenues from these products will continue to decline. As a result, our future prospects will depend on our ability to develop and successfully market new products that address new and growing markets. Our failure to develop new products or failure to achieve widespread customer acceptance of such new products could cause us to lose market share and cause our revenues to decline. There can be no assurance that we will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction, marketing and sale of new products or product enhancements. Factors that could cause delays include regulatory and/or industry approvals, product design cycle and failure to identify products or features that customers demand. In addition, the introduction and sale of new products often involves a significant technical evaluation, and we often face delays because of our customers\u2019 internal procedures for evaluating and deploying new technologies. For these and other reasons, the sales cycle associated with new products is typically lengthy, often lasting six to 24 months and sometimes longer. Therefore, there can be no assurance that our introduction or announcement of new product offerings will achieve any significant or sustainable degree of market acceptance or result in increased revenue in the near term.\nWe may experience significant fluctuation in our revenue because the timing of large orders placed by some of our customers is often project-based.\nOur operating results fluctuate because we often receive large orders from customers that coincide with the timing of the customer\u2019s project. Sales of our products and services may be delayed if customers delay approval or commencement of projects due to budgetary constraints, internal acceptance review procedures, timing of budget cycles or timing of competitive evaluation processes. In addition, sometimes our customers make significant one-time hardware purchases for projects which are not repeated. We sell primarily on a purchase order basis rather than pursuant to long-term contracts, and we expect fluctuations in our revenues as a result of one-time purchases to continue in the future. In addition, our sales may be subject to significant fluctuations based on the acceleration, delay or cancellation of customer projects, or our failure to complete one or a series of significant sales opportunities. Because a significant portion of our operating expenses are fixed, even a single order can have a disproportionate effect on our quarterly revenues and operating results. As a result of the factors discussed above, and due to the complexities of the industry in which we operate, it is difficult for us to forecast demand for our current or future products with any degree of certainty, which means it is difficult for us to forecast our sales. If our quarterly or annual operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the price of our common stock could decline substantially.\nThe lengthy sales cycle for our products and services, along with delays in customer completion of projects, make the timing of our revenues difficult to predict.\nWe have a lengthy sales cycle for many of our products that generally extends between six and 24 months and sometimes longer due to a lengthy customer evaluation and approval process. The length of the sales cycle can be affected by factors over which we have little or no control, including the user\u2019s budgetary constraints, timing of the user\u2019s budget cycles, and concerns by the user about the introduction of new products by us or by our competitors. As a result, sales cycles for user orders vary substantially from user to user. The lengthy sales cycle is one of the factors that has caused and may continue to cause our revenues and operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter. In addition, we may incur substantial expenses and devote significant management effort and expense to develop potential relationships that do not result in agreements or revenues and may prevent us from pursuing other opportunities. Accordingly, excessive delays in sales could be material and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe nature of our products, customer base and sales channels causes us to lack visibility regarding future demand for our products, which makes it difficult for us to predict our revenues or operating results.\nWe use forecasts based on anticipated product orders to manage our manufacturing and inventory levels and other aspects of our business. However, several factors contribute to a lack of visibility with respect to future orders, including:\n\u00b7 the lengthy and unpredictable sales cycle for our products that can extend from six to 24 months or longer;\n\u00b7 the project-driven nature of many of our customers\u2019 requirements;\n\u00b7 the fact that we primarily sell our products indirectly through distributors;\n\u00b7 the uncertainty of the extent and timing of market acceptance of our new products;\n\u00b7 the requirement to obtain industry certifications or regulatory approval for our products;\n\u00b7 the lack of long-term contracts with our customers;\n\u00b7 the diversity of our product lines and geographic scope of our product distribution;\n\u00b7 the fact that we have some customers who make single, non-recurring purchases; and\n\u00b7 the fact that a large number of our customers typically purchase in small quantities.\nThis lack of visibility impacts our ability to forecast our requirements. If we overestimate our customers\u2019 future requirements for products, we may have excess inventory, which would increase our costs and potentially require us to write-off inventory that becomes obsolete. Additionally, if we underestimate our customers\u2019 future requirements, we may have inadequate inventory, which could interrupt and delay delivery of our products to our customers, harm our reputation, and cause our revenues to decline. If any of these events occur, they could prevent us from achieving or sustaining profitability and the value of our common stock may decline.\nWe have a history of losses.\nWe incurred net losses of approximately $277,000 and $1,962,000 for fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively. There can be no assurance that we will generate net profits in future periods. Further, there can be no assurance that we will be cash flow positive in future periods. In the event that we fail to achieve profitability in future periods, the value of our common stock may decline. In addition, if we are unable to achieve or maintain positive cash flows, we would be required to seek additional funding, which may not be available on favorable terms, if at all.\nDelays in qualifying product revisions of existing products for certain of our customers could result in the delay or loss of sales to those customers, which could negatively impact our business and financial results.\nOur industry is characterized by intense competition, rapidly evolving technology and continually changing customer preferences and requirements. As a result, we frequently develop and introduce new versions of our existing products.\nPrior to purchasing our products, some of our customers require that products undergo a qualification process, which may involve testing of the products in the customer\u2019s system. A subsequent revision to a product\u2019s hardware or firmware, changes in the manufacturing process or our selection of a new supplier may require a new qualification process, which may result in delays in sales to customers, loss of sales, or us holding excess or obsolete inventory.\nAfter products are qualified, it can take additional time before the customer commences volume production of components or devices that incorporate our products. If we are unsuccessful or delayed in qualifying any new or revised products with a customer, such failure or delay would preclude or delay sales of such products to the customer, and could negatively impact our financial results. In addition, new revisions to our products could cause our customers to alter the timing of their purchases, by either accelerating or delaying purchases, which could result in fluctuations of net revenue from quarter to quarter.\nDelays in deliveries or quality control problems with our component suppliers could damage our reputation and could cause our net revenue to decline and harm our results of operations.\nWe and our contract manufacturers are responsible for procuring raw materials for our products. Our products incorporate some components and technologies that are only available from single or limited sources of supply. Depending on a limited number of suppliers exposes us to risks, including limited control over pricing, availability, quality and delivery schedules. Moreover, due to the limited amount of our sales, we may not be able to convince suppliers to continue to make components available to us unless there is demand for such components from their other customers. If any one or more of our suppliers cease to provide us with sufficient quantities of components in a timely manner or on terms acceptable to us, we would have to seek alternative sources of supply and we may have difficulty identifying additional or replacement suppliers for some of our components.\nIn particular, some of our integrated circuits are only available from a single source and in some cases are no longer being manufactured. From time to time, integrated circuits, and potentially other components used in our products, will be phased out of production by the manufacturer. When this happens, we attempt to purchase sufficient inventory to meet our needs until a substitute component can be incorporated into our products. Nonetheless, we may be unable to purchase sufficient components to meet our demands, or we may incorrectly forecast our demands, and purchase too many or too few components. In addition, our products use components that have been subject to market shortages and substantial price fluctuations in the past. From time to time, we have been unable to meet customer orders because we were unable to purchase necessary components for our products. We do not have long-term supply arrangements with most of our vendors to obtain necessary components or technology for our products and instead purchase components on a purchase order basis. If we are unable to purchase components from these suppliers, our product shipments could be prevented or delayed, which could result in a loss of sales. If we are unable to meet existing orders or to enter into new orders because of a shortage in components, we will likely lose net revenue, risk losing customers and risk harm to our reputation in the marketplace, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe outsource substantially all of our manufacturing to contract manufacturers in Asia. If our contract manufacturers are unable or unwilling to manufacture our products at the quality and quantity we request, our business could be harmed.\nWe use contract manufacturers based in Asia to manufacture substantially all of our products. Generally, we do not have long-term agreements with our contract manufacturers or suppliers. If any of these subcontractors or suppliers were to cease doing business with us, we might not be able to obtain alternative sources in a timely or cost-effective manner. Our reliance on third-party manufacturers exposes us to a number of significant risks, including:\n\u00b7 reduced control over delivery schedules, quality assurance, manufacturing yields and production costs;\n\u00b7 lack of guaranteed production capacity or product supply;\n\u00b7 reliance on these manufacturers to maintain competitive manufacturing technologies;\n\u00b7 unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, taxes, trade laws and tariffs;\n\u00b7 reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;\n\u00b7 differing labor regulations;\n\u00b7\ndisruptions to the business, financial stability or operations, including due to strikes, labor disputes or other disruptions to the workforce, of these manufacturers;\n\u00b7 compliance with a wide variety of complex regulatory requirements;\n\u00b7 fluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u00b7 changes in a country\u2019s or region\u2019s political or economic conditions;\n\u00b7 effects of terrorist attacks abroad;\n\u00b7 greater difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations; and\n\u00b7 increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities.\nAny problems that we may encounter with the delivery, quality or cost of our products from our contract manufacturers or suppliers could cause us to lose net revenue, damage our customer relationships and harm our reputation in the marketplace, each of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nFrom time to time, we may transition the manufacturing of certain products from one contract manufacturer to another. When we do this, we may incur substantial expenses, risk material delays or encounter other unexpected issues.\nWe depend on distributors to generate a majority of our sales and complete order fulfillment.\nResale of products through distributors accounts for a substantial majority of our worldwide net revenue. In addition, sales through our top five distributors accounted for approximately 50% of our net revenue in fiscal 2017. A significant reduction of effort by one or more distributors to sell our products or a material change in our relationship with one or more distributors may reduce our access to certain end customers and adversely affect our ability to sell our products. Furthermore, if a key distributor materially defaults on a contract or otherwise fails to perform, our business and financial results would suffer.\nIn addition, the financial health of our distributors and our continuing relationships with them are important to our success. Current economic conditions may adversely impact the financial health of some of these distributors. This could result in the insolvency of certain distributors, the inability of distributors to obtain credit to finance the purchase of our products, or cause distributors to delay payment of their obligations to us and increase our credit risk exposure. Our business could be harmed if the financial health of these distributors impairs their performance and we are unable to secure alternate distributors.\nOur ability to sustain and grow our business depends in part on the success of our channel partner distributors and resellers.\nA substantial part of our revenues is generated through sales by channel partner distributors and resellers. To the extent our channel partners are unsuccessful in selling our products or if we are unable to obtain and retain a sufficient number of high-quality channel partners, our operating results could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, our channel partners may devote more resources to marketing, selling and supporting products and services that are competitive with ours, than to our products. They also may have incentives to promote our competitors' products over our products, particularly for our competitors with larger volumes of orders, more diverse product offerings and a longer relationship with our distributors and resellers. In these cases, one or more of our important channel partners may stop selling our products completely or may significantly decrease the volume of products they sell on our behalf. Our channel partner sales structure also could subject us to lawsuits, potential liability and reputational harm if, for example, any of our channel partners misrepresents the functionality of our products or services to customers, violates laws or our corporate policies. If we fail to effectively manage our existing or future sales channel partners effectively, our business and operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\nChanges to the average selling prices of our products could affect our net revenue and gross margins and adversely affect results of operations.\nIn the past, we have experienced reductions in the average selling prices and gross margins of our products. We expect competition to continue to increase, and we anticipate this could result in additional downward pressure on our pricing. Our average selling prices for our products might also decline as a result of other reasons, including promotional programs introduced by us or our competitors and customers who negotiate price concessions. To the extent we are able to increase prices, we may experience a decline in sales volumes if customers decide to purchase competitive products. If any of these were to occur, our gross margins could decline and we might not be able to reduce the cost to manufacture our products to keep up with the decline in prices.\nIf we are unable to sell our inventory in a timely manner, it could become obsolete, which could require us to increase our reserves or write off obsolete inventory, which could harm our operating results.\nAt any time, competitive products may be introduced with more attractive features or at lower prices than ours. If this occurs, and for other reasons, we may not be able to accurately forecast demand for our products and our inventory levels may increase. There is a risk that we may be unable to sell our inventory in a timely manner to avoid it becoming obsolete. If we are required to substantially discount our inventory or are unable to sell our inventory in a timely manner, we would be required to increase our inventory reserves or write off obsolete inventory and our operating results could be substantially harmed.\nOur failure to compete successfully in our highly competitive market could result in reduced prices and loss of market share.\nThe market in which we operate is intensely competitive, subject to rapid technological advances and highly sensitive to evolving industry standards. The market can also be affected significantly by new product and technology introductions and marketing and pricing activities of industry participants. Our products compete directly with products produced by a number of our competitors. Many of our competitors and potential competitors have greater financial and human resources for marketing and product development, more experience conducting research and development activities, greater experience obtaining regulatory approval for new products, larger distribution and customer networks, more established relationships with contract manufacturers and suppliers, and more established reputations and name recognition. For these and other reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against our current or potential future competitors. In addition, the amount of competition we face in the marketplace may change and grow as the market for IoT and M2M networking solutions grows and new companies enter the marketplace. Present and future competitors may be able to identify new markets, adapt new technologies, develop and commercialize products more quickly and gain market acceptance of products with greater success. As a result of these competitive factors, we may fail to meet our business objectives and our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur products may contain undetected software or hardware errors or defects that could lead to an increase in our costs, reduce our net revenue or damage our reputation.\nWe currently offer warranties ranging from one to five years on each of our products. Our products could contain undetected software or hardware errors or defects. If there is a product failure, we might have to replace all affected products without being able to book revenue for replacement units, or we might have to refund the purchase price for the units. Regardless of the amount of testing we undertake, some errors might be discovered only after a product has been installed and used by customers. Any errors discovered after commercial release could result in loss of net revenue and claims against us. Significant product warranty claims against us could harm our business, reputation and financial results and cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nOur inability to obtain appropriate telecommunications carrier certifications, industry certifications or approvals from governmental regulatory bodies could impede our ability to grow revenues in our wireless products.\nThe sale of our wireless products in certain geographical markets is sometimes dependent on the ability to gain telecommunications carrier certifications and/or approvals by certain governmental bodies. In addition, many of our products are certified as meeting various industry quality and/or compatibility standards. Failure to obtain these certifications or approvals, or delays in receiving such certification or approvals, could impact our ability to compete effectively or at all in these markets and could have an adverse impact on our revenues.\nIf software that we incorporate into our products were to become unavailable or no longer available on commercially reasonable terms, it could adversely affect sales of our products, which could disrupt our business and harm our financial results.\nCertain of our products contain software developed and maintained by third-party software vendors or which are available through the \u201copen source\u201d software community. We also expect that we may incorporate software from third-party vendors and open source software in our future products. Our business would be disrupted if this software, or functional equivalents of this software, were either no longer available to us or no longer offered to us on commercially reasonable terms. In either case, we would be required to either redesign our products to function with alternate third-party software or open source software, or develop these components ourselves, which would result in increased costs and could result in delays in our product shipments. Furthermore, we might be forced to limit the features available in our current or future product offerings.\nWe face risks associated with our international operations that could impair our ability to grow our revenues abroad as well as our overall financial condition.\nWe believe that our future growth is dependent in part upon our ability to increase sales in international markets. These sales are subject to a variety of risks, including geopolitical events, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, tariffs, import restrictions and other trade barriers, unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, longer accounts receivable payment cycles, potentially adverse tax consequences, and export license requirements. In addition, we are subject to the risks inherent in conducting business internationally, including political and economic instability and unexpected changes in diplomatic and trade relationships. In many markets where we operate, business and cultural norms are different than those in the U.S., and practices that may violate laws and regulations applicable to us such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, unfortunately are more commonplace. Although we have implemented policies and procedures with the intention of ensuring compliance with these laws and regulations, our employees, contractors and agents, as well as channel partners involved in our international sales, may take actions in violation of our policies. Many of our vendors and strategic business allies also have international operations and are subject to the risks described above. Even if we are able to successfully manage the risks of international operations, our business may be adversely affected if one or more of our business partners are not able to successfully manage these risks. There can be no assurance that one or more of these factors will not have a material adverse effect on our business strategy and financial condition.\nOur failure to comply effectively with regulatory laws pertaining to our foreign operations could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability.\nWe are required to comply with U.S. government export regulations in the sale of our products to foreign customers, including requirements to properly classify and screen our products against a denied parties list prior to shipment. We are also required to comply with the provisions of the FCPA and all other anti-corruption laws, such as the UK Anti-Bribery Act, of all other countries in which we do business, directly or indirectly, including compliance with the anti-bribery prohibitions and the accounting and recordkeeping requirements of these laws. Violations of the FCPA or other similar laws could trigger sanctions, including ineligibility for U.S. government insurance and financing, as well as large fines. Failure to comply with the aforementioned regulations could also affect our decision to sell our products in international jurisdictions, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability.\nOur failure to comply effectively with the requirements of applicable environmental legislation and regulation could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability.\nCertain states and countries have passed regulations relating to chemical substances in electronic products and requiring electronic products to use environmentally friendly components. For example, the European Union has the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive, the Restrictions of Hazardous Substances Directive, and the Regulation on Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals. In the future, China and other countries including the U.S. are expected to adopt further environmental compliance programs. In order to comply with these regulations, we may need to redesign our products to use different components, which may be more expensive, if they are available at all. If we fail to comply with these regulations, we may not be able to sell our products in jurisdictions where these regulations apply, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability.\nForeign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results.\nWe are exposed to market risk primarily related to foreign currencies and interest rates. In particular, we are exposed to changes in the value of the U.S. dollar versus the local currency in which our products are sold and our services are purchased, including devaluation and revaluation of local currencies. Accordingly, fluctuations in foreign currency rates could adversely affect our revenues.\nIn particular, the uncertainty with respect to the ability of certain European countries to continue to service their sovereign debt obligations and the related European financial restructuring efforts may cause the value of the Euro and other European currencies to fluctuate. If the value of European currencies, including the Euro, deteriorates, thus reducing the purchasing power of European customers, our sales could be adversely affected.\nCurrent or future litigation could adversely affect us.\nWe are subject to a wide range of claims and lawsuits in the course of our business. Any lawsuit may involve complex questions of fact and law and may require the expenditure of significant funds and the diversion of other resources. The results of litigation are inherently uncertain, and adverse outcomes are possible.\nIn particular, litigation regarding intellectual property rights occurs frequently in our industry. The results of litigation are inherently uncertain, and adverse outcomes are possible. Adverse outcomes may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThere is a risk that other third parties could claim that our products, or our customers\u2019 products, infringe on their intellectual property rights or that we have misappropriated their intellectual property. In addition, software, business processes and other property rights in our industry might be increasingly subject to third- party infringement claims as the number of competitors grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps. Other parties might currently have, or might eventually be issued, patents that pertain to the proprietary rights we use. Any of these third parties might make a claim of infringement against us. The results of litigation are inherently uncertain, and adverse outcomes are possible.\nResponding to any infringement claim, regardless of its validity, could:\n\u00b7 be time-consuming, costly and/or result in litigation;\n\u00b7 divert management\u2019s time and attention from developing our business;\n\u00b7 require us to pay monetary damages, including treble damages if we are held to have willfully infringed;\n\u00b7 require us to enter into royalty and licensing agreements that we would not normally find acceptable;\n\u00b7 require us to stop selling or to redesign certain of our products; or\n\u00b7 require us to satisfy indemnification obligations to our customers.\nIf any of these occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, which could harm our competitive position or require us to incur significant expenses to enforce our rights.\nWe rely primarily on a combination of laws, such as patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, and contractual restrictions, such as confidentiality agreements and licenses, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. Despite any precautions that we have taken:\n\u00b7 laws and contractual restrictions might not be sufficient to prevent misappropriation of our technology or deter others from developing similar technologies;\n\u00b7 other companies might claim intellectual property rights based upon prior use that negatively impacts our ability to enforce our trademarks and patents;\n\u00b7 policing unauthorized use of our patented technology and trademarks is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and we might be unable to determine the extent of this unauthorized use.\nAlso, the laws of some of the countries in which we market and manufacture our products offer little or no effective protection of our proprietary technology. Reverse engineering, unauthorized copying or other misappropriation of our proprietary technology could enable third parties to benefit from our technology without paying us for it. Consequently, we may be unable to prevent our proprietary technology from being exploited by others in the U.S. or abroad, which could require costly efforts to protect our technology. Policing the unauthorized use of our technology, trademarks and other proprietary rights is expensive, difficult and, in some cases, impracticable. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of management resources, either of which could harm our business. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property, which may harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe impact of natural disasters could negatively impact our supply chain and customers resulting in an adverse impact to our revenues and profitability.\nCertain of our components and other materials used in producing our products are from regions susceptible to natural disasters. A natural disaster could damage equipment and inventory at our suppliers\u2019 facilities, adversely affecting our supply chain. If we are unable to obtain these materials, we could experience a disruption to our supply chain that would hinder our ability to produce our products in a timely manner, or cause us to seek other sources of supply, which may be more costly or which we may not be able to procure on a timely basis. In addition, our customers may not follow their normal purchasing patterns or temporarily cease purchasing from us due to impacts to their businesses in the region, creating unexpected fluctuations or decreases in our revenues and profitability. Natural disasters in other parts of the world on which our operations are reliant also could have material adverse impacts on our business.\nBusiness interruptions could adversely affect our business.\nOur operations and those of our suppliers are vulnerable to interruption by fire, earthquake, power loss, telecommunications failure, cyber security breaches, IT systems failure, terrorist attacks and other events beyond our control. A substantial portion of our facilities, including our corporate headquarters and other critical business operations, are located near major earthquake faults and, therefore, may be more susceptible to damage if an earthquake occurs. We do not carry earthquake insurance for direct earthquake-related losses. If a business interruption occurs, our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nIf our products become subject to cyber security breaches, or if public perception is that they are vulnerable to cyber-attacks, our reputation and business could suffer.\nWe could be subject to liability or our reputation could be harmed if technologies integrated into our products fail to prevent cyber-attacks, or if our partners or customers fail to safeguard the systems with security policies that conform to industry best practices. In addition, any cyber-attack or security breach that affects a competitor\u2019s products could lead to the negative perception that our solutions are or could be subject to similar attacks or breaches.\nCyber security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which could cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, and personally identifiable information of our employees, on our networks. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, which could adversely affect our business.\nAcquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or investments may impair our capital and equity resources, divert our management\u2019s attention or otherwise negatively impact our operating results.\nWe may pursue acquisitions, strategic partnerships and joint ventures that we believe would allow us to complement our growth strategy, increase market share in our current markets and expand into adjacent markets, broaden our technology and intellectual property and strengthen our relationships with distributors, OEMs and ODMs. Any future acquisition, partnership, joint venture or investment may require that we pay significant cash, issue equity or incur substantial debt. Acquisitions, partnerships or joint ventures may also result in the loss of key personnel and the dilution of existing stockholders to the extent we are required to issue equity securities. In addition, acquisitions, partnerships or joint ventures require significant managerial attention, which may be diverted from our other operations. These capital, equity and managerial commitments may impair the operation of our business. Furthermore, acquired businesses may not be effectively integrated, may be unable to maintain key pre-acquisition business relationships, may not result in an increase in revenues or earnings or the delivery of new products, may contribute to increased fixed costs, and may expose us to unanticipated liabilities. If any of these occur, we may fail to meet our business objectives and our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to attract, retain or motivate key senior management and technical personnel, it could seriously harm our business.\nOur financial performance depends substantially on the performance of our executive officers and of key engineers, marketing and sales employees. We are particularly dependent upon our technical personnel, due to the specialized technical nature of our business. If we were to lose the services of our executive officers or any of our key personnel and were not able to find replacements in a timely manner, our business could be disrupted, other key personnel might decide to leave, and we might incur increased operating expenses associated with finding and compensating replacements.\nWe may experience difficulties associated with utilizing third-party logistics providers.\nA majority of our physical inventory management process, as well as the shipping and receiving of our inventory, is performed by third-party logistics providers in Los Angeles, California and Hong Kong. There is a possibility that these third-party logistics providers will not perform as expected and we could experience delays in our ability to ship, receive, and process the related data in a timely manner. This could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and the market price of our common stock.\nRelying on third-party logistics providers could increase the risk of the following: failing to receive accurate and timely inventory data, theft or poor physical security of our inventory, inventory damage, ineffective internal controls over inventory processes or other similar business risks out of our immediate control.\nWe may need additional capital and it may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all.\nTo remain competitive, we must continue to make significant investments to operate our business and develop our products. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the timing and amount of our net revenue, research and development expenditures, expenses associated with any strategic partnerships or acquisitions and infrastructure investments, and expenses related to litigation, each of which could negatively affect our ability to generate additional cash from operations. If cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our working capital requirements, we may need to raise additional capital. Looking ahead at long-term needs, we may need to raise additional funds for a number of purposes, including:\n\u00b7 to fund working capital requirements;\n\u00b7 to update, enhance or expand the range of products we offer;\n\u00b7 to increase our sales and marketing activities; or\n\u00b7 to respond to competitive pressures or perceived opportunities, such as investment, acquisition and international expansion activities.\nWe may seek additional capital from public or private offerings of our capital stock, borrowings under our existing or future credit lines or other sources. If we issue equity or debt securities to raise additional funds, our existing stockholders may experience dilution, and the new equity or debt securities may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our existing stockholders. In addition, if we raise additional funds through collaborations, licensing, joint ventures, or other similar arrangements, it may be necessary to relinquish valuable rights to our potential future products or proprietary technologies, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise any such capital on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we are unable to secure such additional financing, we may not be able to develop or enhance our products, take advantage of future opportunities, respond to competition or continue to operate our business.\nThe terms of our amended credit facility may restrict our financial and operational flexibility and, in certain cases, our ability to operate.\nThe terms of our amended credit facility restrict, among other things, our ability to incur additional indebtedness; pay dividends or make certain other restricted payments; consummate certain asset sales; enter into certain transactions with affiliates; merge or consolidate with other persons; or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets. Further, we are currently and may in the future be required to maintain specified financial ratios, including pursuant to a Minimum Tangible Net Worth covenant and satisfy certain financial conditions. Our ability to meet those financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control, and there can be no assurance that we will meet those tests. Pursuant to our amended credit agreement and the related loan and security agreement, we have pledged substantially all of our assets to our lender, Silicon Valley Bank.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nWe have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, significant fluctuations in net revenue, expenses and operating results from quarter to quarter. We therefore believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance, and you should not rely on them to predict our future operating or financial performance or the future performance of the market price of our common stock. A high percentage of our operating expenses are relatively fixed and are based on our forecast of future revenue. If we were to experience an unexpected reduction in net revenue in a quarter, we would likely be unable to adjust our short-term expenditures significantly. If this were to occur, our operating results for that fiscal quarter would be harmed. In addition, if our operating results in future fiscal quarters were to fall below the expectations of equity analysts and investors, the market price of our common stock would likely fall.\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile based on a number of factors, many of which are not under our control.\nThe market price of our common stock has been highly volatile. The market price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors, many of which are out of our control, including:\n\u00b7 adverse changes in domestic or global economic conditions;\n\u00b7 new products or services offered by our competitors;\n\u00b7 our completion of or failure to complete significant one-time sales of our products;\n\u00b7 actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results;\n\u00b7 changes in financial estimates by securities analysts;\n\u00b7 announcements of technological innovations;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7\nour announcement of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\nconditions or trends in the industry;\n\u00b7 additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u00b7 increased competition from industry consolidation;\n\u00b7 mergers and acquisitions; and\n\u00b7 sales of common stock by our stockholders or us or repurchases of common stock by us.\nIn addition, the NASDAQ Capital Market often experiences price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market.", "PERMNO": 88542, "SIC": 3576, "TIC": "LTRX"}
