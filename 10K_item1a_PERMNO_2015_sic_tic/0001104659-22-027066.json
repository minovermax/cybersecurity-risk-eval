{"cik": "1158324", "company": "COGENT COMMUNICATIONS HOLDINGS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-25", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nMarket Risks\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe offer our services in 50 countries, most of which were significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and financial results will continue to depend on numerous evolving factors that we are not able to accurately predict and which will vary by market. Such future uncertain and unpredictable developments include the ultimate duration and scope of the pandemic, the rise and spread of new COVID-19 variants, the availability and efficacy of vaccines and therapeutic treatments and the willingness of the public to accept such vaccines and treatments, governmental actions that have been taken, or may be taken in the future, in response to the pandemic, and global economic conditions during and after the pandemic.\nPage 12 of 70\nApproximately 60.8% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 was from our corporate customers. Corporate customers are located in multi-tenant office buildings, almost exclusively in the United States and Canada. Authorities in many of these markets implemented numerous measures in response to the pandemic, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, curfews, shelter-in-place and stay-at-home orders and business shutdowns and closures, and also implemented multi-step polices with the goal of re-opening these markets. These measures have impacted, and continue to impact, us and our employees, customers, suppliers and other third parties with whom we do business. The geographic areas in which we operate are in varying stages of restrictions or re-opening. Many jurisdictions have re-opened, while other jurisdictions began re-opening only to return to restrictions in the face of increases in new COVID-19 cases. Considerable uncertainty exists regarding how current and future health and safety measures implemented in response to the pandemic will impact our business, including whether such measures will result in further changes in demand for our services, impair our ability to access buildings to install our services or maintain our network or impact our supply chain. The continuing impact of existing or new mandates, restrictions, laws or regulations could have a material adverse impact on our operations and the operations of our customers or others with whom we do business.\nIn addition, a significant number of our corporate customers have continued remote work policies instituted at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, slowed the pace of opening new offices and closed offices due to global economic conditions. We believe the rapid spread of the Delta and Omicron variants during 2021 further exacerbated the unwillingness of corporate customers to end their remote work policies. In addition, the prevalence of hybrid or fully remote work environments during the pandemic has caused some companies to transition to such environments on a permanent basis, and we do not know what impact this may have on demand for commercial office space and for our services. As a result, through much of 2021, we saw corporate customers take a cautious approach to adding new services and upgrading existing services as well as reduced demand for connecting smaller satellite offices. Since the beginning of the pandemic we have experienced a deteriorating real estate market in the buildings we serve. Vacancy rates for many of our multi-tenant office buildings have risen as a result of many tenants terminating leases and exiting buildings and as a result of lower new leasing activity. The impact of this greater level of vacancy rates was more pronounced in Northern cities and in the California market and less impactful in our Southern markets\nWhere permitted, we will require our employees to return to the office on a full-time basis. We have taken measures to protect our workforce and minimize their exposure to COVID-19, such as requiring our entire workforce to get vaccinated and wear masks in the office, establishing safety procedures in the event an employee tests positive for COVID-19 and severely curtailing all business travel. In addition to the associated costs incurred, these measures may be insufficient in protecting our employees. If a significant percentage of our workforce is unable to work due to the impact of COVID-19, our operations will be negatively impacted. In December 2021, with the rapid spread of the Omicron variant, a number of our offices were required to close by local order and we voluntarily shifted a majority of our workforce to fully remote status. We intend to return to full-time, in-office status when permitted and when we deem it to be safe. As we consider this return, the impact of COVID-19, our response to the pandemic, and compliance with governmental measures imposed in response to COVID-19 has caused, and will continue to cause us to incur additional costs and any inability to comply with such measures may subject us to restrictions on our business activities, fines, and other penalties, any of which may adversely affect our business.\nIn addition, the shift of our workforce to working remotely has amplified certain risks to our business, including increased demand on our information technology resources and systems, increased phishing and other cybersecurity attacks as cybercriminals try to exploit the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, and an increase in the number of points of potential attack, such as laptops and mobile devices (both of which are now being used in increased numbers), to be secured. Any failure to effectively manage these risks, including to timely identify and appropriately respond to any cyberattacks, may adversely affect our business.\nWe may find it difficult to retain existing employees or to hire new employees because we have required all employees in the United States to receive the COVID-19 vaccine and boosters and to return to the office on a full-time basis.\nIn August 2021, we notified our employees in the United States that they would be required to return to the office on a full-time basis beginning in September 2021 and that they would be required to attest that they were fully vaccinated against the COVID-19 virus unless they received a medical or religious exemption. Fully vaccinated employees in the United States began returning to our offices on a full-time basis in early September 2021. Employees had until October 11, 2021 to provide their vaccine self-attestation.\nIn October 2021, we opened most of our non-US offices for employees to return on a voluntary basis and in November 2021, wherever permitted by local law, we required our employees outside of the United States to return to full-time, in-office work. Where permitted by, and subject to, local laws, we will require employees outside of the United States to be fully vaccinated against the COVID-19 virus.\nPage 13 of 70\nThe spread of the Omicron variant around the world in December 2021 caused us to further modify our office environment. First, we mandated that all U.S. employees receive a COVID-19 booster vaccine no later than six weeks after first becoming eligible for such vaccine. Second, we mandated that all U.S. employees provide proof of vaccination to us. Third, for offices around the world that had not been closed by government order, we shifted much of our workforce to fully remote status on a temporary basis at the end of 2021 in order to reduce the density of our offices. Sales representatives with less than 12 months tenure, sales representative on performance improvement plans and their managers are currently still working in our offices on a full-time basis, as we believe that the training and coaching required by new sales representatives is significantly more effective when provided in an in-office environment.\nOur employees have largely complied with our vaccine mandate in the United States and Canada. However, we experienced an increase in employee departures, particularly within our sales department in the third and fourth quarters of 2021. We believe that this rise in departures was attributable in part to the unwillingness of some employees to be vaccinated and/or to return to a full-time, in-office environment. If we continue to mandate COVID-19 vaccinations and require employees to return to our offices on a full-time basis, we may find it difficult to retain existing employees or hire new employees. If this occurs, this may impact our revenue growth and profitability.\nWe are experiencing delays in the delivery of networking equipment and other services from certain of our vendors.\nWe have seen a slowdown in the delivery of network equipment and delays in the projected delivery time of network equipment orders. In addition, vendors who supply us with dark fiber or lit circuits are being impacted by the spread of COVID-19 in their workforce, and this may slow the delivery of services from these vendors to us. While we believe that we can adequately manage the operation, maintenance, upgrading and growth of our network, a worsening or prolonged slowdown of the delivery of network equipment, dark fiber and lit circuits may impact our ability to expand and augment our network and service offerings. If this occurs, this may impact our revenue growth and profitability.\nOur growth and financial health are subject to a number of economic risks.\nA downturn in the world economy, especially the economies of North America and Europe would negatively impact our growth. Our net-centric business would be particularly impacted by a decline in the development of new applications and businesses that make use of the Internet. Our corporate business would be particularly impacted by an increase in vacancy rates in the multi-tenant office buildings that we serve. Our total revenue growth is predicated on growth in the use of the Internet that makes up for the declining prices of Internet service. An economic downturn could impact the Internet business more significantly than other businesses that are less dependent on new applications and growth in the use of those applications and an increase in office vacancy rates because of the retrenchment by consumers and businesses that typically occurs in an economic downturn.\nOur historical reductions in our prices are expected to continue in an inflationary economy.\nMany of the regions in which we operate are experiencing an increase in inflation rates. Due to the nature of our product offerings and the industry in which we operate, which is deflationary, we may be unable to raise our prices. We expect that our historical pricing patterns will continue for the foreseeable future.\nEvents beyond our control may impact our ability to provide our services to our customers or increase the costs or reduce the profitability of providing our services\nCatastrophic events, such as major natural disasters, extreme weather, fire, flooding or similar events as well as the continued threat of terrorist activity and other acts of war or hostility have had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on our headquarters, other offices, our network, infrastructure or equipment or our customers and prospective customers, which could adversely affect our business. These events may also have an adverse impact on business, financial and general economic conditions around the world. We have certain locations through which a large amount of our Internet traffic passes. Examples are facilities in which we exchange traffic with other carriers, the facilities through which our transoceanic traffic passes, and certain of our network hub sites. We are particularly vulnerable to acts of terrorism because our largest customer concentration is located in New York, our headquarters is located in Washington, D.C., and we have significant operations in Paris, Madrid and London, cities that have historically been targets for terrorist attacks and vulnerable to pandemics.\nPage 14 of 70\nIf these or any other of our key facilities were destroyed or seriously damaged, a significant amount of our network traffic could be disrupted. Because of the large volume of traffic passing through these facilities our ability (and the ability of carriers with whom we exchange traffic) to quickly restore service would be challenged. There could be parts of our network or the networks of other carriers that could not be quickly restored or that would experience substantially reduced service for a significant time. If such a disruption occurs, our reputation could be negatively impacted which may cause us to lose customers and adversely affect our ability to attract new customers, resulting in an adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nBusiness Risks\nWe need to retain existing customers and continue to add new customers in order to become consistently profitable and cash flow positive.\nIn order to be consistently profitable and consistently cash flow positive, we need to both retain existing customers and continue to add a large number of new customers. The precise number of additional customers required is dependent on a number of factors, including the turnover of existing customers, the pricing of our product offerings and the revenue mix among our customers. We may not succeed in adding customers if our sales and marketing efforts are unsuccessful. In addition, many of our targeted customers are businesses that are already purchasing Internet access services from one or more providers, often under a contractual commitment. It has been our experience that such targeted customers are often reluctant to switch providers due to costs and effort associated with switching providers. Further, as some of our customers grow larger they may decide to build their own Internet backbone networks or enter into direct connection agreements with telephone and cable companies that provide Internet service to consumers. A migration of a few very large Internet users to their own networks, or to special networks that may be offered by major telephone and cable providers of last mile broadband connections to consumers, or the loss or reduced purchases from several significant customers could impair our growth, cash flow and profitability.\nWe have customers who depend on the U.S. government\u2019s E-rate program for funding. There can be no assurance that the E-rate program will continue or that other governmental programs that fund governments and organizations that are or might become customers will continue. A failure of such programs to continue could result in a loss of customers and impair our growth, cash flow and profitability.\nA substantial and long-term shift to remote work may impact our ability to add new customers and to retain existing customers.\nThrough much of 2021, we saw corporate customers continue their remote work policies and take a cautious approach to new services and upgrades, as well as a reduced demand for connecting smaller satellite offices. We also witnessed a deteriorating real estate market in and around the buildings we service, with rising vacancy levels and falling lease initiations or renewals resulting in fewer sales opportunities for our salesforce. As a result, we experienced a slowdown in new sales to our corporate customers which negatively impacted our corporate revenue growth. If, after the end of the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant number of our corporate customers or potential customers decide to retain remote work policies, we may experience increased customer turnover, fewer upgrades of existing customer configurations and fewer new tenant opportunities. These trends may negatively impact our revenue growth, cash flows and profitability.\nLower vacancy rates as a result of diminished lease terminations and increased leasing and subleasing activity will be a key factor in driving renewed growth in our corporate business.\nDuring the Pandemic we saw increasing vacancy rates in many of our buildings due to higher lease terminations and lower leasing activity. This reduction in tenancy levels was particularly challenging in our Northern and Californian markets. As a result, our level of activity in our corporate business has been adversely affected. In order to see a growing level of corporate activity we believe there will need to be an improvement in the tenancy levels of our buildings through a reduction in tenant exits and increased leasing activity.\nOur business and operations are growing rapidly and we may not be able to efficiently manage our growth.\nWe have grown our company rapidly through network expansion and by obtaining new customers through our sales efforts. Our expansion places significant strains on our management, operational and financial infrastructure. Our ability to manage our growth will be particularly dependent upon our ability to:\n\u25cf expand, develop and retain an effective sales force and qualified personnel;\n\u25cf maintain the quality of our operations and our service offerings;\n\u25cf maintain and enhance our system of internal controls to ensure timely and accurate compliance with our financial and regulatory reporting requirements; and\nPage 15 of 70\n\u25cf expand our accounting and operational information systems in order to support our growth.\nIf we fail to implement these measures successfully, our ability to manage our growth will be impaired.\nDemand from certain employees to work remotely may reduce the attractiveness of our business as an employer versus some competitors who are allowing employees to work remotely.\nIn the fall of 2021 we began to implement an in-office work policy designed to return the vast majority of our employees to an in-office work environment. A small minority of our workforce declined to return to full time in-office employment and left our employment. We are experiencing modest competitive challenges versus some competitors who are offering some employees a hybrid work option. Increasing demands to work in a hybrid work style may reduce our ability to attract and retain employees, in particular attracting and retaining salespeople.\nCompetitive Risks\nOur connections to the Internet require us to establish and maintain relationships with other providers, which we may not be able to maintain.\nThe Internet is composed of various network providers who operate their own networks that interconnect at public and private interconnection points. Our network is one such network. In order to obtain Internet connectivity for our network, we must establish and maintain relationships with other ISPs and certain of our larger customers. These providers may be customers (who connect their network to ours by buying Internet access from us) or may be other large ISPs to whom we connect on a settlement-free peering basis as described below. Both customers and settlement-free peers may be competitors of ours.\nBy entering into what are known as settlement-free peering arrangements, providers agree to exchange traffic between their respective networks without charging each other. Our ability to avoid the higher costs of acquiring paid dedicated network capacity (transit or paid peering) and to maintain high network performance is dependent upon our ability to establish and maintain settlement-free peering relationships and to increase the capacity or to add additional locations of the interconnections provided by these relationships. The terms and conditions of our settlement-free peering relationships may also be subject to adverse changes, which we may not be able to control. If we are not able to maintain or increase our settlement-free peering relationships in all of our markets on favorable terms or to upgrade the capacity of our existing settlement-free peering relationships, we may not be able to provide our customers with high performance, affordable or reliable services, which could cause us to lose existing and potential customers, damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business. Additionally, certain of our current customers may seek to become settlement-free peers with us.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to establish and maintain relationships with other ISPs, favorably resolve disputes with such providers, or increase the capacity of our interconnections with such providers.\nThe sector in which we operate is highly competitive, and we may not be able to compete effectively.\nWe face significant competition from incumbent carriers, Internet service providers and facilities-based network operators. Relative to us, many of these providers have significantly greater financial resources, more well established brand names, larger customer bases, and more diverse strategic plans and service offerings. A number of these providers also have large bases of consumers, which makes their networks particularly attractive to content providers as they can provide a direct connection to their customers.\nIntense competition from these traditional and new communications companies has led to declining prices and margins for many communications services, and we expect this trend to continue as competition intensifies in the future. Decreasing prices for high-speed Internet services have somewhat diminished the competitive advantage that we have enjoyed as a result of our service pricing.\nOur business is premised on the idea that customers want simple Internet access and private networks rather than a combination of such services with other services such as voice services and complex managed services. Our competitors offer such services. Should the market come to favor such services our ability to acquire and keep customers would be impaired. Our competitors may also upgrade their existing services or introduce new technologies or services, such as satellite-based Internet or 5G services that could make our services less attractive to potential customers.\nPage 16 of 70\nOur business could suffer because telephone companies and cable companies may provide better delivery of certain Internet content, including content originating on their own networks, than content on the public Internet.\nBroadband connections provided by cable TV, telephone, and fixed and mobile companies have become the predominant means by which consumers connect to the Internet. The providers of these broadband connections may treat Internet content or other broadband content delivered from different sources differently. The possibility of this has been characterized as an issue of \u201cnet neutrality.\u201d As many of our customers operate websites and services that deliver content to consumers our ability to sell our services would be negatively impacted if Internet content delivered by us was less easily received by consumers than Internet content delivered by others. The FCC had promulgated rules that would have banned practices such as blocking and throttling of Internet traffic, but those rules were rescinded by the FCC in December 2017. Some US states have either issued or are considering their own net neutrality rules. Also, the European Union and other countries in which we operate, have issued similar net neutrality rules. We also do not know the extent to which the providers of broadband Internet access to consumers may favor certain content or providers in ways that may disadvantage us.\nOperational Risks\nOur network may be the target of potential cyber-attacks and other security breaches that could have significant negative consequences.\nOur business depends on our ability to limit and mitigate interruptions to or degradation of the security of our network. We are considered a critical infrastructure provider and therefore may be more likely to be the target of cyber-attacks. Our network, systems, applications, and routers may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses, cyber-attacks, distributed denial of service (DDOS), and other security breaches. We experience such cyber-attacks and other security incidents of varying degrees from time to time, though none which individually or in the aggregate has led to costs or consequences which have materially impacted our operations or business. An attack on or security breach of our network could result in theft of trade secrets, intellectual property, or other company confidential information, the interruption, degradation, or cessation of services, an inability to meet our service level commitments or our financial reporting obligations, and potentially compromise customer data stored on or transmitted over our network. We have experienced cyber-attacks of increasing sophistication which suggest an increase in cyber-attacks that may be state-sponsored or conducted by other well-financed organizations. Moreover, as cyber warfare becomes a tool in asymmetric conflicts between the United States and other nations, we, as a US provider, may be targeted with increasing frequency. We cannot guarantee that our security measures will not be circumvented, thereby resulting in security events, network failures or interruptions that could impact our network security or availability and have a material adverse effect on our business, our ability to meet our financial reporting obligations, financial condition and operational results. We may be required to expend significant resources to protect against such threats, and may experience a reduction in revenues, litigation, and a diminution in goodwill, caused by a compromise of our cybersecurity. Although our customer contracts limit our liability, affected customers and third parties may seek to recover damages from us under various legal theories. In response to past attacks, we have implemented further controls and taken and planned for other preventative actions to further strengthen our systems against future attacks. However, we cannot assure you that such measures will provide absolute security, that we will be able to react in a timely manner, or that our remediation efforts following any past or future attacks will be successful.\nIf the information systems that we depend on to support our customers, network operations, sales, billing and financial reporting do not perform as expected, our operations and our financial results may be adversely affected.\nWe rely on complex information systems to operate our network and support our other business functions. Our ability to track sales leads, close sales opportunities, provision services, bill our customers for our services and prepare our financial statements depends upon the effective integration of our various information systems. In 2020, we developed and deployed our own customer relationship management software for our sales force. We may have difficulty maintaining this software and adding features that our sales representatives require. If our information systems, individually or collectively, fail or do not perform as expected, our ability to make sales, to process and provision orders, to make timely payments to vendors, to ensure that we collect amounts owed to us and prepare and file our financial statements would be adversely affected. Such failures or delays could result in increased capital expenditures, customer and vendor dissatisfaction, loss of business or the inability to add new customers or additional services, and the inability to prepare accurate and timely financial statements all of which would adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nPage 17 of 70\nNetwork Augmentation and Maintenance Risks\nOur network is comprised of a number of separate components, and we may be unable to obtain or maintain the agreements necessary to augment or maintain our network.\nOur network is primarily composed of (i) leased capacity on transoceanic optical fiber; (ii) terrestrial inter-city dark optical fiber; (iii) intra-city dark optical fiber; and (iv) the buildings that we serve and the associated optical fiber connecting those buildings. We lease our optical fiber and obtain access to the buildings on our network, both carrier neutral data centers and multi-tenant office buildings, from a number of vendors. A number of our leases, both for fiber and building access, are up for renewal in any given year. A deterioration in our existing relationship with these operators could impact our network, harm our sales and marketing efforts and could substantially reduce our potential customer base. In addition, portions of our long-haul optical fiber and metro optical fiber are nearing the end of their original projected useful life. While we believe that this fiber will remain usable beyond the projected end date, we face the risk that portions of our network may need to be replaced in the future.\nWe expect to enter additional agreements with carriers and operators to obtain additional facilities, whether optical fiber or buildings, for our network in order to add capacity to our network and to expand our addressable market. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to enter into such agreements in the future, be able to do so on economically attractive terms or find an adequate substitute if we are unable to reach an agreement. Failure to acquire new facilities to augment our network could keep us from adding new markets, capacity or buildings to our network and negatively impact our growth opportunities.\nOur off-net business could suffer delays and problems due to the actions of \u201clast mile\u201d providers on whom we are partially dependent.\nOur off-net customers are connected to our network by means of fiber optic capacity that are provided as services by local telephone and cable companies and others. We may experience problems with the installation, maintenance and pricing of these lines which could adversely affect our results of operations and our plans to add additional off-net customers to our network using such services. We have historically experienced installation and maintenance delays when the network provider is devoting resources to other services, such as traditional telephony, cable TV services and private network services. We have also experienced pricing problems when a lack of alternatives allows a provider to charge high prices for capacity in a particular area or to a particular building. We attempt to reduce this problem by using many different providers so that we have alternatives for linking an off-net customer to our network. Competition among the providers tends to improve installation intervals, maintenance and pricing. Additionally, these providers are often competing with us for the same customers, and have marketed their own service to our off-net customers when our initial contract with our customer nears the end of its term.\nOur business could suffer from an interruption of service from our fiber providers.\nThe optical fiber cable owners from whom we have obtained our inter-city and intra-city dark fiber maintain that dark fiber. We are contractually obligated under the agreements with these carriers to pay maintenance fees, and if we are unable to continue to pay such fees we would be in default under these agreements. If these carriers fail to maintain the fiber or disrupt our fiber connections due to our default or for other reasons, such as business disputes with us, bankruptcy, and governmental takings, our ability to provide service in the affected markets or parts of markets would be impaired unless we have or can obtain alternative fiber routes. Some of the companies that maintain our inter-city dark fiber and some of the companies that maintain our intra-city dark fiber are also competitors of ours in portions of our business. Consequently, they may have incentives to act in ways unfavorable to us. While we have successfully mitigated the effects of prior service interruptions and business disputes in the past, we may incur significant delays and costs in restoring service to our customers in connection with future service interruptions, and as a result we may lose customers.\nSubstantially all of our network infrastructure equipment is manufactured or provided by a single network infrastructure vendor.\nWe purchase from Cisco Systems, Inc. (\u201cCisco\u201d) the routers and transmission equipment used in our network. We have recently experienced delays in obtaining certain network equipment from Cisco due to supply chain issues. If Cisco fails to provide equipment on a timely basis or fails to meet our performance expectations, including in the event that Cisco fails to enhance, maintain, upgrade or improve its products, hardware or software we purchase from them when and how we need them, we may be delayed or unable to provide services as and when requested by our customers. We also may be unable to upgrade our network and face greater difficulty maintaining and expanding our network.\nTransitioning from Cisco to another vendor would be disruptive because of the time and expense required to learn to install, maintain and operate the new vendor\u2019s equipment and to operate a multi-vendor network. Any such disruption could increase our costs, decrease our operating efficiencies and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nPage 18 of 70\nCisco may also be subject to litigation with respect to the technology on which we depend, including litigation involving claims of patent infringement. Such claims have been growing rapidly in the communications industry. Regardless of the merit of these claims, they can result in the diversion of technical and management personnel, or require us to obtain non-infringing technology or enter into license agreements for the technology on which we depend. There can be no assurance that such non-infringing technology or licenses will be available on acceptable terms and conditions, if at all.\nInternational Operations Risks\nOur international operations expose us to numerous risks.\nWe have expanded our network into 50 countries worldwide on every continent other than Antarctica. We continue to explore expansion opportunities. We have experienced difficulties, ranging from lack of dark fiber, to regulatory issues, to slower revenue growth rates from our operations in these markets. If we are not successful in developing our market presence in these regions, our operating results and revenue growth could be adversely impacted.\nOur international operations involve a number of risks, including:\n\u25cf fluctuations in currency exchange rates, particularly those involving the Euro as we are required to fund certain of our cash flow requirements of our operations outside of the United States and our \u20ac350.0 million senior unsecured notes in Euros;\n\u25cf exposure to additional regulatory and legal requirements, including import restrictions and controls, exchange controls, tariffs and other trade barriers and privacy and data protection regulations;\n\u25cf compliance with laws regarding corruption and bribery, including the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;\n\u25cf difficulties in staffing and managing our foreign operations;\n\u25cf changes in political and economic conditions, and\n\u25cf exposure to additional and potentially adverse tax regimes.\nAs we continue to expand into other countries, our success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks. Our failure to manage these risks and grow our operations outside the United States may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nLitigation Risks\nAs an Internet service provider, we may incur liabilities for the content disseminated through our network or for network failures, delays or errors in transmissions\nThe law relating to the liabilities of ISPs for information carried on or disseminated through their networks is unsettled. As the law in this area develops and as we expand our international operations, the potential imposition of liabilities upon us for the behavior of our customers or the information carried on and disseminated through our network could require us to implement measures to reduce our exposure to such liabilities, which may require the expenditure of substantial resources or the discontinuation of certain products or service offerings. Any costs that are incurred as a result of such measures or the imposition of liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRegulatory Risks\nExisting and proposed privacy regulations may impact our business\nMany countries, including the United States, are considering adopting, or have already adopted, privacy regulations or laws that would govern the way an Internet user\u2019s data is used. The primary impact of these rules are on businesses that collect personal information about consumer users of their services. We do not provide services to individual consumers and do not collect such personal information. However, we transmit data across the Internet, which data may include personal information collected by our customers. As the applicability of privacy regulations to the types of services we provide remains unsettled, we may be required to adopt additional measures in the future.\nPrivacy regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) in the European Union and the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d) in California vary in scope and in the obligations they impose on us. As new laws are implemented or existing structures are declared insufficient, such as the Privacy Shield program in place between the US and EU, we may find it difficult to comply with such regulations or find it costly to do so. Moreover, for our customers who collect personal information, increased regulation of the collection, processing and use of personal data may impact their business and their use of services in unknown ways.\nPage 19 of 70\nChanges in laws, rules, and enforcement could adversely affect us.\nWe are not subject to substantial regulation by the FCC or the state public utilities commissions in the United States. Internet service is also subject to minimal regulation in Western Europe and in Canada. Elsewhere the regulation is greater, though not as extensive as the regulation for providers of voice services. However, governmental authorities may decide to impose additional regulation and taxes upon providers of Internet access and private network services. All of these matters could inhibit our ability to remain a low-cost carrier and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and our results of operations.\nAs with the privacy laws described earlier, much of the laws related to the liability of Internet service providers for content on the network and the behavior of our customers and their end users remains unsettled. Some jurisdictions have laws, regulations, or court decisions that impose obligations upon ISPs to restrict access to certain content. Other legal issues, such as the sharing of copyrighted information, data protection, trans-border data flow, unsolicited commercial email (\u201cspam\u201d), universal service, and liability for software viruses could become subjects of additional legislation and legal development and changes in enforcement policies. We cannot predict the impact of these changes on us. They could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and our results of operations.\nChanges in laws, rules and enforcement may also adversely affect our customers. For example, a possible repeal or curtailing of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act in the United States could have an adverse impact on our customers and, consequently, on us. While our top 25 customers represented less than 6.0% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021, several large net-centric customers are or may be the subject of increased regulatory scrutiny, which may impact their businesses and, consequently, their use of our services in unknown ways.\nWe may be required to censor content on the Internet, which we may find difficult to do and which may impact our ability to provide our services in some countries as well as impact the growth of Internet usage, upon which we depend.\nSome governments attempt to limit access to certain content on the Internet. It is impossible for us to filter all content that flows across the Internet connections we provide. For example, some content is encrypted when a secure website is accessed. It is difficult to limit access to websites by blocking a fixed set of Internet addresses when the website operators engage in practices that make it difficult to block them. Should any government require us to perform these types of blocking procedures we could experience difficulties ranging from incurring additional expenses to ceasing to provide service in that country. We could also be subject to penalties if we fail to implement the censorship.\nTax Risks\nGovernments may assert that we are liable for taxes which we have not collected from our customers or paid to our vendors and we may have to begin collecting a multitude of taxes if Internet services become subject to taxation similar to the taxation of telephone service.\nIn the United States Internet services are generally not subject to taxes. Consequently, in the United States we collect few taxes from our customers even though most telecommunications services are subject to numerous taxes. Various local jurisdictions have asserted or may assert that some of our operations or services should be subject to local taxes. If such jurisdictions assess taxes on prior years we may be subject to a liability for unpaid taxes that we may be unable to collect from our customers or former customers. If the taxation of Internet service is expanded we will need to collect those taxes from our customers. The process of implementing a system to properly bill and collect such taxes may require significant resources. In addition, the FCC is considering changes to its Universal Services Fund that could result in its application to Internet services. This too would require that we expend resources to collect this tax. Finally, the cumulative effect of these taxes levied on Internet services could discourage potential customers from using Internet services to replace traditional telecommunication services and negatively impact our ability to grow our business.\nOur private network services, such as our VPN services, are subject to taxes and fees in various jurisdictions including the Universal Service Contribution tax in the US. We believe we collect all required taxes, however, a jurisdiction may assert we have failed to collect certain taxes. The expense of paying any unpaid taxes could be substantial and we might not be able to collect such back taxes from our customers.\nWe are subject to value-added taxes and other taxes in many jurisdictions outside of the United States. We are also subject to audit of our tax compliance in numerous jurisdictions. These may result in the assessment of amounts due that are material and therefore would have an adverse effect on us.\nPage 20 of 70\nThe utilization of certain of our net operating loss carryforwards is limited and depending upon the amount of our taxable income we may be subject to paying income taxes earlier than planned.\nSection 382 of the Internal Revenue Code in the United States limits the utilization of net operating losses when ownership changes, as defined by that section, occur. We have performed an analysis of our Section 382 ownership changes and have determined that the utilization of certain of our net operating loss carryforwards in the United States is limited. Further, recent changes to the tax law in the United States and changes to tax laws in other jurisdictions in which we operate may impact our utilization of our net operating losses.\nRisk Factors Related to Our Indebtedness\nWe have substantial debt which we may not be able to repay when due.\nOur total indebtedness, at par, at December 31, 2021 was $1.1 billion and includes $500.0 million of our 3.50% senior secured notes and \u20ac350.0 million of our 4.375% senior unsecured notes. Our $500.0 million senior secured notes are due in May 2026 and require annual interest payments of $17.5 million per year - paid semi-annually. Our \u20ac350.0 million of senior unsecured notes are due in June 2024 and require annual interest payments of \u20ac15.3 million per year - paid semi-annually. All of our noteholders have the right to be paid the principal upon default and upon certain designated events, such as certain changes of control. Our total indebtedness at December 31, 2021 included $245.9 million of finance lease obligations for dark fiber primarily under 15 - 20 year IRUs. Our total indebtedness at December 31, 2021 excludes $124.0 million of operating lease liabilities which we were required to be recorded as right-to-use assets and operating lease liabilities in connection with the adoption of ASU No. 2016-02 Leases on January 1, 2019. The amount of our IRU finance lease obligations may be impacted due to our expansion activities, the timing of payments and fluctuations in foreign currency rates. The amount of US dollars required to fund our interest and principal obligations for our Euro-denominated notes may be impacted due to fluctuations in the Euro to US Dollar exchange rate. We may not have sufficient funds to pay the interest and principal related to these obligations at the time we are obligated to do so, which could result in bankruptcy, or we may only be able to raise the necessary funds on unfavorable terms.\nOur substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our notes and our other indebtedness.\nWe have substantial indebtedness. Our substantial debt may have important consequences. For instance, it could:\n\u25cf make it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations, including those relating to our debt;\n\u25cf require us to dedicate a substantial portion of any cash flow from operations to the payment of interest and principal due under our debt, which will reduce funds available for other business purposes, including the growth of our operations, capital expenditures, dividends, purchases of our common stock and acquisitions;\n\u25cf place us at a competitive disadvantage compared with some of our competitors that may have less debt and better access to capital resources; and\n\u25cf limit our ability to obtain additional financing required to fund working capital and capital expenditures, for strategic acquisitions and for other general corporate purposes.\nOur ability to satisfy our obligations including our debt depends on our future operating performance and on economic, financial, competitive and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow, and future financings may not be available to provide sufficient net proceeds, to meet these obligations or to successfully execute our business strategy.\nPage 21 of 70\nWe have assumed the risk associated with variable interest rates under our interest rate swap agreement.\nBeginning in August 2021 we used a derivative financial instrument to manage our interest rate risk on our 2026 Notes. As of December 31, 2021, we were party to an interest rate swap agreement (the Swap Agreement\u201d) that has the economic effect of modifying the fixed-interest rate obligation associated with our 2026 Notes to a variable interest rate obligation based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d). The Swap Agreement is recorded at its fair value at each reporting period and we incur gains and losses due to changes in market interest rates. We have a $20.0 million interest-bearing deposit with the counterparty to the Swap Agreement. If the fair value of the Swap Agreement exceeds a net liability of $20.0 million, we will be required to deposit additional funds with the counterparty equal to the net liability fair value in excess of $20.0 million. As of December 31, 2021, the fair value of the Swap Agreement was a net liability of $9.0 million and, as a result, $9.0 million of the $20.0 million deposit was restricted and $11.0 million was unrestricted. The values that we report for the Swap Agreement as of each reporting date are recognized as interest expense with the corresponding amounts included in assets or liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. By entering into this Swap Agreement, we have assumed the risk associated with variable interest rates based upon SOFR relate to our 2026 Notes. We did not elect hedge accounting for our Swap Agreement. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.\nDespite our leverage we may still be able to incur more debt. This could further exacerbate the risks that we and our subsidiaries face.\nWe and our subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness, including additional secured indebtedness, in the future. The terms of our debt indentures restrict, but do not completely prohibit, us from doing so. In addition, the indentures allow us to issue additional notes and other indebtedness secured by the collateral under certain circumstances. Moreover, we are not prevented from incurring other liabilities that do not constitute indebtedness as defined in the indentures, including additional operating leases obligations and finance lease obligations in the form of IRUs. These liabilities may represent claims that are effectively prior to the claims of our note holders. If new debt or other liabilities are added to our debt levels the related risks that we and our subsidiaries now face could intensify.\nThe agreements governing our various debt obligations impose restrictions on our business and could adversely affect our ability to undertake certain corporate actions.\nThe agreements governing our various debt obligations include covenants imposing significant restrictions on our business. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. These covenants place restrictions on our ability to, among other things:\n\u25cf incur additional debt;\n\u25cf create liens;\n\u25cf make certain investments;\n\u25cf enter into certain transactions with affiliates;\n\u25cf declare or pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions to stockholders; and\n\u25cf consolidate, merge or transfer or sell all or substantially all of our assets.\nOur ability to comply with these agreements may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. These covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, merger and acquisition or other corporate opportunities. The breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default under the agreements governing our debt obligations.\nTo service our indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash. However, our ability to generate cash depends on many factors many of which are beyond our control.\nOur ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future, which, in turn, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nPage 22 of 70\nOur business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and we may not have available to us future borrowings in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. In these circumstances, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. We may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Without this financing, we could be forced to sell assets or secure additional financing to make up for any shortfall in our payment obligations under unfavorable circumstances. However, we may not be able to secure additional financing on terms favorable to us or at all and, in addition, the terms of the indentures governing our notes limit our ability to sell assets and also restrict the use of proceeds from such a sale. We may not be able to sell assets quickly enough or for sufficient amounts to enable us to meet our obligations, including our obligations under our notes.", "PERMNO": 89297, "SIC": 4813, "TIC": "CCOI"}
