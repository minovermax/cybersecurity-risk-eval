{"cik": "1076682", "company": "POLARITYTE, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-01-14", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nOur business and operations are subject to many risks and uncertainties as described below. However, the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we may currently deem immaterial, may become important factors that could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations. If any of the following risks occur, our financial condition or results of operations could suffer.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nIf the clinical development and commercialization of our lead product candidate, SkinTE, is not successful, our ability to finance our operations may be adversely affected.\nOur near-term prospects depend upon our ability to effectively market our lead product candidate, SkinTE, and to demonstrate its safety and effectiveness in humans, as well as its superiority over existing therapies and standards of care. Our ability to finance our company and to generate revenues will depend in part on our ability to obtain favorable results in the planned clinical evaluations of SkinTE and to successfully develop and commercialize SkinTE.\nSkinTE could be unsuccessful if it:\n\u25cf does not demonstrate acceptable safety and efficacy in humans, or otherwise does not meet applicable regulatory standards;\n\u25cf does not offer sufficient, clinically meaningful therapeutic or other improvements over existing or future therapies used to treat burns or other defects of skin tissues/integument for which it is being tested and evaluated;\n\u25cf is not capable of being produced in commercial quantities at acceptable costs or acceptable timelines; or\n\u25cf is not accepted as safe, efficacious, cost-effective, less costly, and preferable to current therapies in the medical community and by third-party payers.\nIf we are not successful in developing and commercializing SkinTE or are significantly delayed in doing so, our financial condition and prospects may be adversely affected and we may experience difficulties in raising the substantial additional capital required to fund our business.\nWe are an early stage company. Our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and prospects, and our profitability in the future is uncertain.\nOur limited operating history hinders an evaluation of our prospects, which should be considered in light of the risks, expenses, and difficulties frequently encountered in the establishment of a new business in an industry with many market participants and intense competition, and in the shift from development to commercialization of new product candidates based on innovative technologies.\nWe have a history of operating losses and may never achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe have incurred significant operating losses, and may continue to incur significant operating losses over the next several years. We incurred a net loss of $65.4 million for the year ended October 31, 2018. Our ability to achieve profitable operations in the future will depend in large part upon the successful development and commercialization of our product candidates and technologies. Factors impacting our ability to successfully develop and commercialize our product candidates include:\n\u25cf approvals by or registrations with the FDA and other US and foreign government agencies;\n\u25cf our ability to educate and train physicians and hospitals on the benefits of our product candidates;\n\u25cf the rate at which providers adopt our technology and product candidates;\n\u25cf our ability to scale up our commercialization, including our selling and manufacturing activities;\n\u25cf our ability to complete the development of our product candidates in a timely manner;\n\u25cf our ability to obtain adequate reimbursement from third parties for our products and product candidates; and\n\u25cf other activities generally necessary to introduce and bring new products and medical technologies to market.\nThe likelihood of the long-term success of our company must be considered in light of the expenses, difficulties, and delays frequently encountered in the development and commercialization of new and innovative medical techniques and technologies, unknown and uncertain regulatory hurdles for a new and novel technology or technique, competitive factors and competition, as well as the uncertain nature of new business development and ongoing capital requirements.\nWe may have inadequate resources to complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates or to continue our development programs.\nWe are a development stage company, and thus we expect to continue to spend a significant amount of cash on research and development of our product candidates. Until we can successfully commercialize our product candidates and achieve significant revenue, if any, we will be required to raise additional capital to fund our ongoing operations. We may not be able to raise capital on acceptable terms, or at all.\nThe cost and timing of completion of our preclinical and clinical development programs is uncertain.\nWe expect that a large percentage of our future research and development expenses will be incurred in support of current and future preclinical and clinical development programs. These expenditures are subject to numerous uncertainties in timing and cost of completion. We evaluate our objectives in preclinical models based upon our own development goals, but such evaluation may differ from requirements of regulatory authorities. We may conduct early stage clinical trials, which may differ for each of our targeted markets or markets we may target in the future (i.e., presently, skin, bone, muscle, cartilage, fat, blood vessels, and nerves). As we obtain results from investigations, preclinical studies, or clinical trials, we may elect to discontinue or delay further evaluations for certain product candidates or programs to focus resources on more promising product candidates or programs. Completion of clinical trials may take several years and the length of time generally varies according to the type, complexity, novelty, and intended use of a product candidate. The cost of clinical trials is uncertain and may vary significantly over the life of a product or development project because of unanticipated differences, regulatory requirements, or other obligations, or challenges arising during clinical development.\nOur product development programs are based on novel technologies. As a result, our product candidates are inherently risky.\nWe cannot guarantee that the results we see in clinical applications will be comparable to the preclinical results we have observed in animals for all our product candidates. We also cannot at this stage be certain of the safety of all product candidates that may be developed from our platform technology in humans.\nWe are subject to the risks of failure inherent in the development of product candidates based on new technologies. The novel nature of our products creates significant challenges regarding product development and optimization, manufacturing, government regulation, third-party reimbursement, and market acceptance. For example, if regulatory agencies have limited experience or concerns in approving cellular and tissue-based therapies for commercialization, the development and commercialization pathway for our therapies may be subject to increased uncertainty, as compared to the pathway for new conventional drugs.\nFurther, when manufacturing autologous cell and tissue-based therapies, the number and the composition of the cell population varies from patient to patient, in part due to the age of the patient, since the therapy is dependent on patient-specific physiology. Such variability in the number and composition of these cells could adversely affect our ability to manufacture autologous cell and tissue-based therapies in a cost-effective manner and meet acceptable product release specifications for use in a clinical trial or, if approved or registered, for commercial sale. Consequently, the development and regulatory approval or registration process for autologous cell and tissue-based product candidates could be delayed or may never be completed.\nOur product candidates represent new classes of therapy that the marketplace may not understand or accept. Furthermore, the success of our product candidates is dependent on wider acceptance by the medical community.\nThe market may not understand or accept our product candidates. Our product candidates represent new treatments or therapies and compete with a number of more conventional products and therapies manufactured and marketed by others. The new nature of our product candidates creates significant challenges regarding product development and optimization, manufacturing, government regulation, and third-party reimbursement.\nAs a result, the development pathway for our product candidates and the commercialization of our potential products may be subject to increased scrutiny, as compared to the pathway(s) for more conventional products.\nThe degree of market acceptance of any of our potential products will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf The clinical safety and effectiveness of our products and their perceived advantage over alternative treatment methods;\n\u25cf Our ability to convince healthcare providers that the use of our products in a procedure is more beneficial than the standard of care or other available methods;\n\u25cf Our ability to explain clearly and educate others on the autologous use of patient-specific human cells and tissue-based products, and to avoid potential confusion with and differentiate ourselves from the ethical controversies associated with human fetal tissue and engineered human tissue;\n\u25cf Adverse reactions involving our products or the products or product candidates of others that are cell- or tissue-based; and\n\u25cf The cost of our products and the reimbursement policies of government and other third-party payers, including the amounts of reimbursement made for our products and the conditions for such reimbursement.\nIf patients or the medical community do not accept our potential products as safe and effective for any of the foregoing reasons, or for any other reason, it could affect our sales, having a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur revenues from our regenerative medicine business will depend upon adequate reimbursement from public and private insurers and health systems.\nOur success will depend on the extent to which reimbursement for the costs of our treatments will be available from third-party payers, such as public and private insurers and health systems, as well as the amounts that they will agree to reimburse. Government and other third-party payers attempt to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement, and the amount of reimbursement for new treatments. Therefore, significant uncertainty usually exists as to the reimbursement status of new healthcare treatments. If we are not successful in obtaining adequate reimbursement for our treatments from these third-party payers, the market\u2019s acceptance of our treatments could be adversely affected. Inadequate reimbursement levels also likely would create downward price pressure on our treatments. Even if we succeed in obtaining widespread reimbursement for our treatments at adequate pricing, future changes in reimbursement policies could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCommercial third-party payers and government payers are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by demanding price discounts, including by limiting coverage on which products they will pay for and the amounts that they will pay for new products, and by creating conditions to reimbursement, such as coverage eligibility requirements based upon clinical evidence development involving research studies and the collection of physician decision impact and patient outcomes data. Because of these cost-containment trends, commercial third-party payers and government payers that currently provide or in the future may provide reimbursement for one or more of our product candidates may reduce, suspend, revoke, or discontinue payments or coverage at any time, including those payers that designate one or more of our product candidates as experimental and investigational. Payers may also create conditions to coverage or contract with third-party vendors to manage laboratory benefit coverage, in both cases creating burdens for ordering by physicians and patients that may make our product candidates more difficult to sell. The percentage of submitted claims that are ultimately paid, the length of time to receive payment on claims, and the average reimbursement of those paid claims, is likely to vary from period to period. Finally, payers may demand discounts or offer reimbursement that minimizes our ability to sell our products profitably, or simply choose to not cover or reimburse our products at all.\nAs a result, there is significant uncertainty surrounding whether the use of products that incorporate new technology, such as our product candidates, will be eligible for coverage by commercial third-party payers and government payers or, if eligible for coverage, what the reimbursement rates will be for these product candidates. The fact that a product has been approved for reimbursement in the past, or has received FDA approval, for any particular indication or in any particular jurisdiction, does not guarantee that such product will remain approved for reimbursement or that similar or additional products will be approved in the future. Reimbursement of our existing and future products by commercial third-party payers and government payers may depend on a number of factors, including a payer\u2019s determination that our existing and future products are:\n\u25cf not experimental or investigational;\n\u25cf medically reasonable and necessary;\n\u25cf appropriate for the specific patient;\n\u25cf cost effective;\n\u25cf supported by peer-reviewed publications;\n\u25cf included in clinical practice guidelines and pathways; and\n\u25cf supported by clinical utility and health economic studies demonstrating improved outcomes and cost effectiveness.\nMarket acceptance, sales of products based upon our platform technology, and our profitability may depend on reimbursement policies and healthcare reform measures. Several entities conduct technology assessments and provide the results of their assessments for informational purposes to other parties. These assessments may be used by third-party payers and healthcare providers as grounds to deny coverage for a product. The levels at which government authorities and third-party payers, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, may reimburse the price patients pay for such products could affect whether we are able to commercialize our product candidates. Our product candidates may receive negative assessments that may impact our ability to receive reimbursement of the test. Since each payer makes its own decision as to whether to establish a policy to reimburse our test, seeking these approvals may be a time-consuming and costly process. We cannot be sure that reimbursement in the United States or elsewhere will be available for any of our product candidates in the future. If reimbursement is not available or is limited, we may not be able to commercialize our product candidates.\nThe United States and foreign governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to reduce the cost of healthcare. We expect that there will continue to be federal and state proposals to implement governmental controls or impose healthcare requirements. In addition, the Medicare program and increasing emphasis on managed or accountable care in the United States will continue to put pressure on product utilization and pricing. Utilization and cost control initiatives could decrease the volume of orders and payment that we would receive for any products in the future, which would limit our revenue and profitability. If we are unable to obtain reimbursement approval from commercial third-party payers and Medicare and Medicaid programs for our product candidates, or if the amount reimbursed is inadequate, our ability to generate revenues could be limited.\nWe are subject to numerous federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, and a failure to comply with such laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on our business and our ability to compete in the marketplace.\nThere are numerous laws and regulations that govern the means by which companies in the healthcare industry may market their treatments to healthcare professionals and may compete by discounting the prices of their treatments, including for example, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal False Claims Act (\u201cFCA\u201d), and state law equivalents to these federal laws that are meant to protect against fraud and abuse and analogous laws in foreign countries. Violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and civil sanctions, including, but not limited to, in some instances civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, and exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. In addition, federal and state laws are also sometimes open to interpretation. Accordingly, we could potentially face legal risks if our interpretation differs from those of enforcement authorities. Further, from time to time we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage if our interpretation differs from that of our competitors.\nSpecifically, anti-kickback laws and regulations prohibit any knowing and willful offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration (direct or indirect, in cash or in kind) in return for the referral, use, ordering, or recommending of the use of a product or service for which payment may be made by Medicare, Medicaid or other Government-sponsored healthcare programs. We have entered into consulting agreements, research agreements and product development agreements with physicians, including some who may order our products or make decisions to use them. In addition, some of these physicians own our stock, which they purchased in arm\u2019s length transactions on terms identical to those offered to non-physicians, or received stock awards from us as consideration for services performed by them. While these transactions were structured with the intention of complying with all applicable laws, including state anti-referral laws and other applicable anti-kickback laws, it is possible that regulatory or enforcement agencies or courts may in the future view these transactions as prohibited arrangements that must be restructured or for which we would be subject to other significant civil or criminal penalties. There can be no assurance that regulatory or enforcement authorities will view these arrangements as following applicable laws or that one or more of our employees or agents will not disregard the rules we have established. Because our strategy relies on the involvement of physicians who consult with us on the design of our potential products, perform clinical research on our behalf, or educate the market about the efficacy and uses of our potential products, we could be materially impacted if regulatory or enforcement agencies or courts interpret our financial relationships with physicians who refer or order our potential products to be in violation of applicable laws and determine that we would be unable to achieve compliance with such applicable laws. This could harm our reputation and the reputations of the physicians we engage to provide services on our behalf. In addition, the cost of noncompliance with these laws could be substantial since we could be subject to monetary fines and civil or criminal penalties, and we could also be excluded from federally-funded healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, for non-compliance. Further, even the costs of defending investigations of noncompliance could be substantial.\nAlso, the FCA imposes civil liability on any person or entity that submits, or causes the submission of, a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. Damages under the FCA can be significant and consist of the imposition of fines and penalties. The FCA also allows a private individual or entity (i.e., a whistleblower) with knowledge of past or present fraud against the federal government to sue on behalf of the government and to be paid a portion of the government\u2019s recovery, which can include both civil penalties and up to three times the amount of the government\u2019s damages (usually the amount reimbursed by federal healthcare programs). The U.S. Department of Justice on behalf of the government takes the position that the marketing and promotional practices of life sciences product manufacturers, including the off-label promotion of products, the provision of inaccurate or misleading reimbursement guidance, or the payment of prohibited kickbacks to doctors or other referral sources may cause the submission of improper claims to federal and state healthcare entitlement programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, by health care providers that use the manufacturer\u2019s products, which results in a violation of the FCA. In certain cases, manufacturers have entered into criminal and civil settlements with the federal government under which they entered into plea agreements, paid substantial monetary amounts, and entered into corporate integrity agreements that require, among other things, substantial reporting and remedial actions going forward.\nIn addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and other health care providers. In addition to federal laws, some states, such as California, Massachusetts, and Vermont, mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs, along with the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation, and other remuneration to physicians. The shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with different compliance or reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions increase the possibility that a healthcare company may run afoul of one or more of the requirements.\nThe scope and enforcement of all these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change, especially considering the lack of applicable precedent and regulations. There can be no assurance that federal or state regulatory or enforcement authorities will not investigate or challenge our current or future activities under these laws. Any investigation or challenge could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Any state or federal regulatory or enforcement review of us, regardless of the outcome, would be costly and time consuming. Additionally, we cannot predict the impact of any changes in these laws, whether these changes are retroactive or will have effect on a going-forward basis only.\nWe operate in a highly competitive and evolving field and face competition from regenerative medicine, biotech, and pharmaceutical companies, tissue engineering entities, tissue processors and medical device manufacturers, as well as new market entrants.\nWe operate in a very competitive and continually evolving field. Competition from other regenerative medicine, biotech, and pharmaceutical companies, tissue engineering entities, tissue processors, medical device companies and from research and academic institutions is intense, expected to increase, subject to rapid change, and could be significantly affected by new product introductions. Our failure to compete effectively would have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nSpecifically, we face significant competition in both the regenerative medicine and wound care space from multiple products, including ReCell, Integra Bilayer Wound Matrix, EpiFix, Apligraf, Dermagraft, Grafix, Epicel, and others. The availability and price of our competitors\u2019 products could limit the demand and the price we are able to charge for our product candidates. We may not be able to implement our business plan if the acceptance of our product candidates is inhibited by price competition or the reluctance of physicians to switch from existing methods of treatment to our product candidates, or if physicians switch to other new drug or biologic products, or choose to reserve our product candidates for use in limited circumstances.\nOur access to sensitive patient information is subject to complex regulations at multiple levels and we would be adversely affected if we fail to adequately protect this information.\nWe receive, maintain and utilize personal health and other confidential and sensitive data as part of the treatments we provide. We have developed a web and mobile application through which our customers can communicate with physicians and others, which may involve sharing patient identifiable health information. The use and disclosure of such information is regulated at the federal, state and international levels, and these laws, rules and regulations are subject to change and increased enforcement activity, such as the audit program implemented by HHS under HIPAA. International laws, rules and regulations governing the use and disclosure of such information are generally more stringent than in the United States, and they vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Noncompliance with any privacy or security laws or regulations, or any security breach, cyber-attack or cybersecurity breach, and any incident involving the theft, misappropriation, loss, or other unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, sensitive or confidential information, whether by us or by a third party, could require us to expend significant resources to remediate any damage, interrupt our operations, and damage our brand and reputation, and could also result in investigations, regulatory enforcement actions, material fines and penalties, loss of customers, litigation, or other actions which could have a material adverse effect on our business, brand, reputation, cash flows, and operating results.\nOur business depends on provider and patient willingness to entrust us with health related and other sensitive personal information. Events that negatively affect that trust, including incorrect or incomplete disclosure of our uses of their information, or failing to keep our information technology systems and sensitive information secure from significant attack, theft, damage, loss, or unauthorized disclosure or access, whether as a result of our action or inaction or that of third parties, could adversely affect our brand, reputation, and revenues, and also expose us to mandatory disclosure to the media, litigation (including class action litigation), and other enforcement proceedings, material fines, penalties or remediation costs, and compensatory, special, punitive, and statutory damages, consent orders, or injunctive relief, any of which could adversely affect our business, cash flows, operating results, or financial position. There can be no assurance that any such failure will not occur, or if any does occur, that we will detect it or that it can be sufficiently remediated.\nMany of our competitors have substantially greater resources than we do, and we expect that all our product candidates will face intense competition from existing or future products.\nAll our product candidates face intense competition from existing and future products marketed by large, well-established companies (including but not limited to Avita Medical, Integra LifeSciences, Wright Medical Group, MiMedx, Osiris, Organogenesis, Allosource, MTF Biologics and Vericel). These competitors may successfully market products that compete with our product candidates, successfully identify product candidates or develop products earlier than we do, or develop products that are more effective or cost less than our products. These competitive factors could require us to conduct additional new research and development activities to establish new competitive product targets, which would be costly and time consuming. These activities would adversely affect our ability to effectively commercialize products and achieve revenue and profits.\nWe depend heavily on our senior management and we may be unable to replace key executives if they leave.\nThe loss of the services of one or more members of our senior management team or our inability to attract, retain and maintain additional senior management personnel could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. Our operations and prospects depend in large part on the performance of our senior management team, particularly Dr. Denver Lough, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief R&D Officer. In addition, we may not be able to find qualified replacements if his services are no longer available. We do not presently maintain \u201ckey-man\u201d life insurance on any of our executives or key employees.\nMany executive officers and employees in the regenerative medicine business are subject to strict non-compete or confidentiality agreements with their employers, which would limit our ability to recruit them to join our company. In addition, some of our existing and future employees are or may be subject to confidentiality agreements with previous employers. Our competitors may allege breaches of and seek to enforce such non-compete agreements or initiate litigation based on such confidentiality agreements. Such litigation, whether or not meritorious, may impede our ability to hire executive officers and other key employees who have been employed by our competitors and may result in intellectual property claims against us.\nIf serious adverse or inappropriate side effects are identified during the development or use of our product candidates or with any procedures with which our product candidates are used, we may need to abandon or limit our development of those product candidates.\nIf our product candidates are associated with undesirable side effects or have characteristics that are unexpected, we may need to abandon their use or development or limit them to certain uses or subpopulations in which the undesirable side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent, less severe or more acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective. In addition, if any of the procedures with which our product candidates are used is determined to be unsafe, we may be required to delay, alter, or abandon our product development or commercialization.\nWe intend to, but may not be successful in, establishing and maintaining strategic partnerships.\nWe intend to enter into strategic partnerships in the future to enhance and accelerate the development and commercialization of our proposed products. We may rely on such partnerships to assist in launching, marketing, and developing our product candidates. However, we may face significant competition in seeking appropriate strategic partners and the negotiation process is time-consuming and complex. Moreover, we may not be successful in our efforts to establish a strategic partnership or other alternative arrangements for any future proposed products and programs because our research and development pipeline may be insufficient, our proposed products and programs may be deemed to be at too early of a stage of development for collaborative effort, or third parties may not view our product candidates and programs as having the requisite potential to demonstrate safety and efficacy or other requirements or goals that potential strategic partners may seek. Even if we are successful in our efforts to establish strategic partnerships, the terms that we agree upon may not be favorable to us, and we may not be able to maintain such strategic partnerships if, for example, development or approval of a product candidate is delayed or sales of an approved or registered product are disappointing.\nRapid technological change could cause our business to become obsolete.\nThe technologies underlying our product candidates are subject to rapid and profound technological change. Competition intensifies as technical advances in each field are made and become more widely known. There is no assurance that others will not develop services, products, or processes with significant advantages over the products, services, and processes that we offer or are seeking to develop. Any such occurrence could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nThe success of any of our product candidates or enhancements to an existing product will depend on numerous factors, including our ability to:\n\u25cf properly identify and anticipate physician and patient needs;\n\u25cf develop and introduce enhancements in a timely manner;\n\u25cf adequately protect our intellectual property and avoid infringing upon the intellectual property rights of third parties;\n\u25cf demonstrate safety and efficacy in humans; and\n\u25cf obtain the necessary regulatory clearances, registrations, or approvals.\nIf we do not develop and, when necessary, obtain regulatory clearance, registration, or approval for product candidates or product enhancements in time to meet market demand, or if there is insufficient demand for these products or enhancements, our results of operations will suffer. Our research and development efforts may require a substantial investment of time and resources before we are able to determine the commercial viability of a new product, technology, material, or other innovation. In addition, even if we can successfully develop enhancements or new generations of our product candidates, these enhancements or new generations of product candidates may not produce sales more than the costs of development, and they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences or the introduction by our competitors of product candidates embodying new technologies or features.\nTo be commercially successful, we must convince physicians that our treatments are safe and effective alternatives to existing treatments and that our treatments should be accepted and used.\nWe believe physicians will only adopt our treatment if they determine, based on experience, clinical data and published peer reviewed journal articles, that the use of our treatment is a favorable alternative to existing and conventional methods, such as adopting the use of SkinTE as a substitute for skin grafting. Physicians may be slow to change their medical treatment practices for the following reasons, among others:\n\u25cf lack of evidence supporting additional patient benefits from our treatments over existing and conventional methods;\n\u25cf perceived liability risks generally associated with the use of new procedures and general resistance to change; or\n\u25cf limited availability or amounts of reimbursement from third-party payers.\nIn addition, while acceptance by the medical community may be fostered by broad evaluation via peer-reviewed literature, we may not have the resources to facilitate sufficient publication. We also believe that recommendations for, and support of our treatments by, influential physicians are essential for market acceptance and adoption. If we do not obtain this support or are unable to demonstrate favorable long-term clinical data, physicians and hospitals may not use our treatments, which would have a material and adverse effect on our result of operations and prospects.\nIf we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to sell and market our product candidates, we may not be successful in commercializing them.\nWe recently formed a sales and marketing team for SkinTE, which we intend to further develop. Nevertheless, our experience in the sale and marketing of SkinTE and other potential products is very limited, and we cannot predict whether or to what extent our internal sales effort may be successful. To achieve commercial success for any product candidate, we must either develop an effective internal sales and marketing team or outsource these functions to third parties.\nThere are risks involved both with establishing our own sales and marketing capabilities and entering into arrangements with third parties to perform these services. For example, recruiting and training a sales force is expensive and time consuming and could delay any product launch. If the commercial launch of SkinTE, OsteoTE, or another product candidate for which we recruit a sales force and establish marketing capabilities is delayed or does not occur for any reason, we would have prematurely or unnecessarily incurred these commercialization expenses. This may be costly, and our investment would be lost if we cannot retain or reposition our sales and marketing personnel.\nIf we enter into arrangements with third parties to perform sales, marketing and distribution services, our product revenues or the profitability of these product revenues to us are likely to be lower than if we were to market and sell any products ourselves. In addition, we may not be successful in entering into arrangements with third parties to sell and market our potential products or may be unable to do so on terms that are favorable to us. We likely will have limited control over such third parties, and any of them may fail to devote the necessary resources and attention to sell and market our potential products effectively and in compliance with applicable laws.\nSignificant disruptions of information technology systems or breaches of information security could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely to a large extent upon information technology systems to protect our intellectual property and to operate our business. In the ordinary course of business, we collect, store, and transmit large amounts of confidential information, including, but not limited to, our trade secrets and data, personal information, and intellectual property. The size and complexity of our information technology and information security systems make such systems potentially vulnerable to service interruptions or to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees or vendors, or from malicious attacks by third parties. Such attacks are of ever-increasing levels of sophistication and are made by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives (including, but not limited to, industrial espionage and market manipulation) and expertise. There can be no assurance that our efforts to protect our data and related information technology and intellectual property will prevent service interruptions or security breaches. Any interruption or breach in our systems could adversely affect our business operations or result in the loss of critical or sensitive confidential information or intellectual property, and could result in financial, legal, business, and reputational harm to us or allow third parties to gain material, inside information that they use to trade in our securities.\nWe face the risk of product liability claims and may not be able to obtain or maintain adequate product liability insurance.\nOur business exposes us to the risk of product liability claims that are inherent in the manufacturing, processing, and marketing of human cellular and tissue-based products. We may be subject to such claims if our product candidates cause, or appear to have caused, an injury during clinical trials or after commercialization. Claims may be made by patients, healthcare providers, or others selling our product candidates. Defending a lawsuit, regardless of merit, could be costly, divert management attention, and result in adverse publicity, which could result in the withdrawal of, or reduced acceptance of, our product candidates in the market.\nAlthough we have obtained product liability insurance, such insurance is subject to deductibles and coverage limitations and we may not be able to maintain this insurance. Also, it is possible that claims could exceed the limits of our coverage. If we are unable to obtain or maintain product liability insurance at an acceptable cost or on acceptable terms with adequate coverage, or otherwise protect ourselves against potential product liability claims or we underestimate the amount of insurance we need, we could be exposed to significant liabilities, which may harm our business. A product liability claim or other claim with respect to uninsured liabilities or for amounts in excess of insured liabilities could result in significant costs and significant harm to our business.\nWe may implement a product recall or voluntary market withdrawal, which could significantly increase our costs, damage our reputation and disrupt our business.\nThe manufacturing, marketing, and processing of our product candidates involves an inherent risk that our tissue products or processes do not meet applicable quality standards and requirements. In that event, we may voluntarily implement a recall or market withdrawal or may be required to do so by a regulatory authority. A recall or market withdrawal of one of our product candidates would be costly and would divert management resources. A recall or withdrawal of one of our product candidates, or a similar product processed by another entity, also could impair sales of our product candidates because of confusion concerning the scope of the recall or withdrawal, or because of the damage to our reputation for quality and safety.\nWe may not be able to effectively control and manage our growth.\nOur strategy envisions a period of rapid growth. Our expected growth may impose a significant burden on our future planned administrative and operational resources. The growth of our business may require significant investments of capital and increased demands on our management, workforce, and facilities. We will be required to substantially expand our administrative and operational resources and attract, train, manage, and retain qualified management and other personnel. Failure to do so or to satisfy such increased demands would interrupt or would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe may increasingly become a target for public scrutiny, including complaints to regulatory agencies, negative media coverage, including social media and malicious reports, all of which could severely damage our reputation and materially and adversely affect our business and prospects.\nWe focus on the research and development (including through preclinical, animal testing) of therapies used in the regenerative medicine and wound care space, and such therapies may be the subject of regulatory, watchdog, and media scrutiny and coverage, which also raise the possibility of heightened attention from the public, the media and other stakeholders. From time to time, these objections or allegations, regardless of their veracity, may result in public protests or negative publicity, which could result in government inquiry or harm our reputation. Corporate transactions we or related parties undertake may also subject us to increased media exposure and public scrutiny. There is no assurance that we would not become a target for public scrutiny in the future or such scrutiny and public exposure would not severely damage our reputation as well as our business and prospects.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nWe do not currently own any issued patents and our ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology through patents and other means is uncertain and may be inadequate, which could have a material and adverse effect on us.\nOur success depends significantly on our ability to protect our proprietary rights in technologies that presently consist of trade secrets and patent applications. We currently have no issued patents relating to any of our product candidates. We intend to expand our patenting activities and rely on patent protection, as well as a combination of copyright, trade secret, and trademark laws and nondisclosure, confidentiality, and other contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary technology, and there can be no assurance these methods of protection will be effective. These legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage. In addition, our presently pending patent applications include claims to material aspects of our activities that are not currently protected by issued patents. The patent application process can be time consuming and expensive. We cannot ensure that any of the pending patent applications we acquire, have acquired, or may file will result in issued patents. Competitors may be able to design around our patents or develop procedures that provide outcomes that are comparable or even superior to ours. There is no assurance that the inventors of the patents and applications that we expect to own or license were the first-to-invent or the first-inventor-to-file on the inventions, or that a third party will not claim ownership in one of our patents or patent applications. We cannot assure you that a third party does not have or will not obtain patents that could preclude us from practicing the patents we own or license now or in the future.\nThe failure to obtain and maintain patents or protect our intellectual property rights could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We cannot be certain that, if challenged, any patents we ultimately obtain would be upheld because a determination of the validity and enforceability of a patent involves complex issues of fact and law. If one or more of any patents we obtain is invalidated or held unenforceable, such an outcome could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage we might otherwise have had.\nIn the event a competitor infringes upon any patent we obtain, or a third party including but not limited to a university or other research institution, makes a claim of ownership over our patents or other intellectual property rights, confirming, defending, or enforcing those rights may be costly, uncertain, difficult, and time consuming.\nThere can be no assurance that a third party, including, but not limited to, a university or other research institution that our founders were associated with in the past, will not make claims to ownership or other claims related to our technology.\nThere can be no assurance that a third party, including but not limited to, a university or other research institution that our founders were associated with in the past, will not make claims to ownership or other claims related to our technology. We believe we have developed our technology outside of any institutions, but we cannot guarantee such institutions would not assert a claim to the contrary. Even if successful, litigation to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights could be expensive and time consuming, and could divert our management\u2019s attention. Further, bringing litigation to enforce our future patent(s) subjects us to the potential for counterclaims. If one or more of our future patents is challenged in U.S. or foreign courts or the United States Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cUSPTO\u201d) or foreign patent offices, the patent(s) may be found invalid or unenforceable, which could harm our competitive position. If any court or any patent office ultimately cancels or narrows the claims in any of our future patents through any pre- or post-grant patent proceedings, such an outcome could prevent or hinder us from being able to enforce the patent against competitors. Such adverse decisions could negatively affect our future revenue and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees have wrongfully appropriated, used, or disclosed intellectual property of their former employers.\nWe employ individuals who were previously employed by other companies, universities, or academic institutions. We may be subject to claims that we or our employees have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of a prior employer. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel, which could adversely impact our business. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees. Any of the foregoing could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe may be subject to claims that former or current employees, collaborators, or other third parties have an interest in our patents or other intellectual property as an inventor or co-inventor. Litigation may be necessary to defend against any claims challenging inventorship. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights, such as exclusive ownership of, or right to use, valuable intellectual property. Such an outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information and know-how related to any of our product candidates, our competitive position would be impaired and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nSome of our technology, including our knowledge regarding the processing of our product candidates, is unpatented and is maintained by us as trade secrets. To protect these trade secrets, the information is restricted to our employees, consultants, collaborators, and advisors on a need-to-know basis. In addition, we require our employees, consultants, collaborators and advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of their relationships with us. These agreements require that all confidential information developed by the individual or made known to the individual by us during the individual\u2019s relationship with us be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties. These agreements, however, do not ensure protection against improper use or disclosure of confidential information, and these agreements may be breached. A breach of confidentiality could affect our competitive position. In addition, in some situations, these agreements and other obligations of our employees to assign intellectual property to the Company may conflict with, or be subject to, the rights of third parties with whom our employees, consultants, collaborators, or advisors have previous employment or consulting relationships. Also, others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets.\nAdequate remedies may not exist in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information. The disclosure of our trade secrets could impair our competitive position and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may become subject to claims of infringement of the intellectual property rights of others, which could prohibit us from developing our treatment, require us to obtain licenses from third parties, or to develop non-infringing alternatives, and subject us to substantial monetary damages. We have not obtained and do not intend to obtain any legal opinion regarding our freedom to practice our technology.\nThird parties could assert that our processes, product candidates, or technology infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights. Whether a process, product, or technology infringes a patent or other intellectual property involves complex legal and factual issues, the determination of which is often uncertain. We cannot be certain that we will not be found to have infringed the intellectual property rights of others. Because patent applications may remain unpublished for certain periods of time and may take years to be issued as patents, there may be applications now pending of which we are unaware or that do not currently contain claims of concern that may later result in issued patents that our product candidates, procedures, or processes will infringe. There may be existing patents that our product candidates, procedures, or processes infringe, of which infringement we are not aware. Third parties could also assert ownership over our intellectual property. Such an ownership claim could cause us to incur significant costs to litigate the ownership issues. If an ownership claim by a third party were upheld as valid, we may be unable to obtain a license from the third party on acceptable terms, to continue to make, use, or sell technology free from claims by that third party of infringement of the third party\u2019s intellectual property. We have not obtained, and do not have a present intention to obtain, any legal opinion regarding our freedom to practice our technology.\nIf we are unsuccessful in actions we bring against the patents of other parties, and it is determined that we infringe upon the patents of third parties, we may be subject to injunctions, or otherwise prevented from commercializing potential products or services in the relevant jurisdiction, or may be required to obtain licenses to those patents or develop or obtain alternative technologies, any of which could harm our business. Furthermore, if such challenges to our patent rights are not resolved in our favor, we could be delayed or prevented from entering into new collaborations or from commercializing certain product candidates or services, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIf we are successful in obtaining patent protection, we may not be able to enforce those patent rights against third parties.\nSuccessful challenge of any future patents such as through opposition, reexamination, inter partes review, interference, or derivation proceedings could result in a loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required relating to intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential or sensitive information could be compromised by disclosure in the event of litigation. In addition, during litigation there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions, or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property in countries outside of the United States.\nIntellectual property law outside the United States is uncertain and, in many countries, is currently undergoing review and revisions. The laws of some countries do not protect patent and other intellectual property rights to the same extent as United States laws. Third parties may challenge our patents in foreign countries by initiating pre- and post-grant oppositions or invalidation proceedings. Developments during opposition or invalidation proceedings in one country may directly or indirectly affect a corresponding patent or patent application in another country in an adverse manner. It may be necessary or useful for us to participate in proceedings to determine the validity of our patents or our competitors\u2019 patents that have been issued in countries other than the United States. This could result in substantial costs, divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Registration or Regulatory Approval of Our Product Candidates and Other Government Regulations\nOur business is subject to continuing regulatory oversight by the FDA and other authorities, whose requirements are costly to comply with, and our failure to comply could result in negative effects on our business.\nThe FDA has specific regulations governing human cell, tissue, and cellular and tissue-based products, commonly known as \u201cHCT/Ps\u201d. The FDA has broad post-market and regulatory and enforcement powers. The FDA\u2019s regulation of HCT/Ps includes requirements for registration and listing of products, donor screening and testing, processing and distribution (\u201cCurrent Good Tissue Practices\u201d), labeling, record keeping, adverse-reaction reporting, inspection, and enforcement.\nWe believe SkinTE and OsteoTE are appropriately regulated under Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act (so-called \u201c361 HCT/Ps\u201d) and that, as a result, no premarket review or approval by the FDA is required. If the FDA does not agree that one or more of our HCT/P products meet its regulatory criteria for regulation solely as 361 HCT/Ps, our product candidates will be regulated as drugs, devices, or biological products, and we could be required to withdraw those products from the market until the required clinical trials are complete and the applicable premarket regulatory clearances or approvals are obtained.\nOther products we develop may not be 361 HCT/Ps. As result, those product candidates would be subject to additional regulatory requirements, including premarket approval or clearance. Even if pre-market clearance or approval is obtained, the approval or clearance may place substantial restrictions on the indications for which the products may be marketed or to whom the products may be marketed, and may require warnings to accompany the product or impose additional restrictions on the sale or use of the product. In addition, regulatory approval is subject to continuing compliance with regulatory standards, including the FDA\u2019s current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) or quality system regulations and adverse event reporting regulations.\nIf we fail to comply with the FDA regulations regarding our products and manufacturing processes, the FDA could take enforcement action, including, without limitation, any of the following sanctions:\n\u25cf Untitled letters, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees, product seizures, or civil penalties;\n\u25cf Operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of clinical studies, manufacturing, marketing, or distribution;\n\u25cf Refusing requests for clearance or approval of new products, processes, or procedures, or for certificates or approval to enable export of the same;\n\u25cf Withdrawing or suspending current applications for approval or clearance, or any approvals or clearances already granted; and\n\u25cf Civil or criminal prosecution.\nIt is likely that the FDA\u2019s regulation of 361 HCT/Ps and other types of products (e.g., drugs, devices, or biologics) will continue to evolve in the future. Complying with any such new regulatory requirements, guidance or statutes may entail significant time delays and expense, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. While the FDA may issue new or revised guidance or regulations for 361 HCT/Ps, we do not know whether or when such revised draft or final guidance or regulations (if any) will be issued, the scope of such guidance, any new rules or regulations, whether they will apply to our technologies or products, or whether they will be advantageous or disadvantageous to us. In addition, even if it does not issue new regulations or guidance, the FDA could in the future adopt more restrictive interpretations of existing regulations or increase its enforcement activity, which may adversely affect our business.\nWe believe our FDA-registered SkinTE and OsteoTE products satisfy applicable criteria for regulation as a 361 HCT/P and are therefore exempt from FDA requirements for premarket approval or clinical studies. If the FDA disagrees with our interpretation of the relevant laws and regulations as they apply to these product candidates, and requires an Investigational New Drug application (\u201cIND\u201d) or Investigational Device Exemption application (\u201cIDE\u201d) for any of our product candidates, we may need to delay, abandon, or revise our current development plans, discontinue ongoing marketing, or recall products. The submission of an IND, Biologics License Applications (\u201cBLA\u201d), New Drug Application (\u201cNDA\u201d), or other medical device clearance or approval application would require us to compile significant amounts of data related to that regulatory process, as well as data from preclinical or clinical testing. We cannot guarantee that we will ever be able to secure such approvals, if required. Even if such approvals are obtained, regulation as a drug, biologic, or medical device would subject us to additional FDA post marketing requirements that are complex and involve substantial expense, such as compliance with drug, biologic, or medical device current Good Manufacturing Practice or quality system requirements.\nThe FDA regulates HCT/Ps under a two-tiered framework. Certain higher risk HCT/Ps are regulated as new drugs, biologics, or medical devices. Manufacturers of new drugs, biologics, and some medical devices must complete extensive clinical trials, which must be conducted pursuant to an effective IND or IDE. In addition, the FDA must review and approve a BLA or NDA before a new drug or biologic may be marketed. For most medical devices, including novel or high-risk medical devices, the FDA must approve a premarket approval application (\u201cPMA\u201d) or grant clearance to a premarket notification (\u201c510(k)\u201d) application prior to marketing of the device.\nBy contrast, the FDA exempts 361 HCT/Ps from these requirements if they meet certain specified criteria. We believe that SkinTE and OsteoTE, meet the criteria for regulation as a 361 HCT/P rather than as a new drug or biologic or medical device and, therefore, we do not currently expect that these products will be subject to the requirement for an IND or IDE or FDA premarket review and approval. Thus, our financial and business plans assume that we will not need to seek or obtain premarket FDA approval or clearance for SkinTE or OsteoTE. Rather, we will have to comply with the requirements for 361 HCT/Ps set forth in FDA regulations and develop adequate substantiation to support marketing claims we plan to make. The FDA could disagree with our belief that our product candidates, including but not limited to SkinTE and OsteoTE, are 361 HCT/Ps. The FDA conducted an inspection of our Salt Lake City, UT manufacturing facility in July 2018, and issued certain inspectional observations on Form FDA 483. We responded to those observations and are continuing a productive dialog with the FDA.\nThe Tissue Reference Group (\u201cTRG\u201d) is a body within the FDA designed to provide recommendations regarding whether a product candidate will be regulated as a 361 HCT/P. The Office of Combination Products (\u201cOCP\u201d) at FDA provides informal and formal opinions regarding the classification of products as 361 HCT/Ps or drugs, biologics, or medical devices. Product manufacturers are not required to consult with the TRG or OCP and instead can market their products based on their own conclusion that the product meets the 361 HCT/P criteria. We have not consulted the TRG or sought a formal opinion from the OCP.\nThe regulatory pathway for cell and tissue-based products is subject to significant uncertainty. The FDA\u2019s criteria for regulation as a 361 HCT/P are complex, and the FDA has provided limited guidance on the meaning of certain terms used in the criteria, such as \u201cminimal manipulation,\u201d \u201chomologous,\u201d or \u201ccombination of the cells and tissues with another article.\u201d In addition, SkinTE and OsteoTE, use new technology that may present a matter of first impression for the FDA in determining whether to require premarket authorization. Further, our product candidates may receive a high degree of scrutiny from the FDA. The FDA or Congress could change the relevant criteria or interpretations for determining which products qualify as 361 HCT/Ps or the regulatory requirements for HCT/Ps.\nAdditionally, it may be difficult to convince the courts to overturn any adverse decisions made against us by the FDA. Courts have recognized the longstanding principle that the FDA\u2019s decisions on scientific matters, including the agency\u2019s conclusion that a tissue processing procedure involves more than minimal manipulation, are entitled to substantial deference. This means that if the FDA disagrees with our conclusion that any of our product candidates should be regulated as a 361 HCT/P, and not as a new biologic, drug, or medical device, it may be very difficult to challenge the agency\u2019s position in court.\nEven if the FDA regulates our product candidates, including SkinTE or OsteoTE, as 361 HCT/Ps, we must still generate adequate substantiation for any claims we will make in our marketing. Failure to establish such adequate substantiation in the opinion of federal or state authorities could substantially impair our ability to generate revenue.\nAlthough as 361 HCT/Ps, we may not need to submit certain products to the FDA for premarket approval or be subject to FDA requirements for labeling or promotion of new drugs, biologics, or medical devices, we still must generate adequate substantiation for claims we make in our marketing materials. Both the Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d) and the states retain jurisdiction over the marketing of 361 HCT/Ps (and other) products in commerce and require a reasonable basis for claims made in marketing materials. Through our planned preclinical and clinical studies, as well as other endeavors, we intend to generate such adequate substantiation for any claims we make about our products. If, however, after we commence marketing of any of our product candidates, including SkinTE or OsteoTE, the FTC or one or more states conclude that we lack adequate substantiation for our claims, we may be subject to significant penalties, or may be forced to alter our marketing of our product candidates in one or more jurisdictions. Any of this could materially harm our business. In addition, if our promotion of any of our product candidates suggests that the HCT/P is not intended for homologous use, the FDA might consider the product to be a new drug, biologic, or medical device. We will therefore be limited in the promotional claims that we can make about our product candidates.\nAny changes in the governmental regulatory classifications of our product candidates could prevent, limit, or delay our ability to market or develop our product candidates.\nThe FDA establishes regulatory requirements based on the classification of a product. An HCT/P is a product containing or consisting of human cells or tissue intended for transplantation into a human patient. 361 HCT/Ps are not subject to any premarket clearance or approval requirements and are subject to less extensive post-market regulatory requirements. Because Several of our products are, or will be, designed to satisfy the standards applicable to 361 HCT/Ps, any change in the regulatory classification or designation of our products would affect our ability to obtain FDA approval or clearance for, and marketing of, those products.\nIf one of our products is deemed not to be a 361 HCT/P, FDA regulations will require premarket clearance or approval requirements that will involve significant time and cost investments by us. Further, there can be no assurance that the FDA will not, at some future point, change its position on current or future products\u2019 361 HCT/P status, and any regulatory reclassification could have adverse consequences for us and make it substantially more difficult or expensive for us to conduct our business by requiring extensive clinical trials, premarket clearance, or approval, and compliance with additional post-market regulatory requirements with respect to those products. Moreover, increased regulatory scrutiny within the industry in which we operate could lead to increased regulation of HCT/Ps, including 361 HCT/Ps. We also cannot assure you that the FDA will not impose more stringent interpretations, restrictions, or requirements with respect to products that qualify as 361 HCT/Ps.\nEven if we successfully launch any product candidate, it will be subject to ongoing regulation. We could be subject to significant penalties if we fail to comply with these requirements, and we may be unable to commercialize our product candidates.\nEven if the FDA does not object to the marketing of any of our product candidates as a 361 HCT/P and, therefore, without an NDA, BLA, PMA, or 510(k), we will still be subject to numerous post-market requirements, including those related to registration and listing, record keeping, labeling, current good tissue practices (\u201ccGTPs\u201d), donor eligibility, deviation and adverse event reporting, and other activities. HCT/Ps that do not meet the definition of a 361 HCT/P and, therefore, are required to be approved or cleared via an NDA, BLA, PMA, or 510(k) are also subject to these or additional obligations. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could be subject to, without limitation, warning letters, product seizures, injunctions, or civil and criminal penalties. We have established our own processing facility, which we believe is cGTP compliant. Any failure by us to maintain cGTP compliance would require remedial actions, which could potentially include actions such as product recalls or delays in distribution and sales of our products, as well as enforcement actions.\nWe face significant uncertainty in the industry due to government healthcare reform.\nThere have been and continue to be proposals by the federal government, state governments, regulators and third-party payers to control healthcare costs (including but not limited to capitation - the generalized cap on annual fees for a type of service or procedure such as burn or wound care or rehabilitation), and generally, to reform the healthcare system in the United States. There are many programs and requirements for which the details have not yet been fully established or the consequences are not fully understood. These proposals may affect aspects of our business. We also cannot predict what further reform proposals, if any, will be adopted, when they will be adopted, or what impact they may have on us.\nRisks Related to Our Manufacturing\nOur failure to comply with the regulatory guidelines set forth by the FDA with respect to our product candidates could delay or prevent the completion of market entry, clinical trials, the approval or registration of any product candidates, or the commercialization of our product candidates.\nWe are subject to regulation and inspection by the FDA for cGTP, with respect to our 361 HCT/P products, and current Good Manufacturing Practice (\u201ccGMP\u201d), with respect to our product candidates that are not 361 HCT/Ps. Complying with cGTP or cGMP and will require that we expend time, money, and effort in production, recordkeeping, and quality control to assure that the product meets applicable specifications and other requirements. For any products for which we are required to obtain FDA pre-market approval, we, or our contracted manufacturing facility, must also pass a pre-approval inspection prior to FDA approval. Failure to pass a pre-approval inspection may significantly delay FDA approval of our product candidates. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we would be subject to possible regulatory action and may be limited in the jurisdictions in which we are permitted to sell our product candidates. As a result, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially harmed.\nWe have limited experience in manufacturing products for commercial purposes and we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully and efficiently manage the manufacturing of our product candidates, either ourselves or through third-party contractors with whom we may enter strategic relationships.\nThe manufacture of cell and tissue-based therapy products, such as our product candidates, is highly complex and is characterized by inherent risks and challenges such as autologous raw material inconsistencies, logistical challenges, significant quality control and assurance requirements, manufacturing complexity, and significant manual processing. Unlike products that rely on chemicals for efficacy, such as most pharmaceuticals, cell and tissue-based therapy products are difficult to characterize due to the inherent variability of biological input materials.\nAdditionally, we have limited experience in manufacturing products for commercial purposes and could experience difficulties in the continued manufacturing of our product candidates. Because our experience in manufacturing, sales, marketing, and distribution is limited, we may encounter unforeseen difficulties in our efforts to efficiently manage the manufacturing, sale, and distribution of our product candidates, or have to rely on third-party contractors, over which we may not have sole control, to manufacture our product candidates. Moreover, there can be no assurance that we or any third-party contractors with whom we enter strategic relationships will be successful in streamlining manufacturing operations and implementing efficient, low-cost manufacturing capabilities and processes that will enable us to meet the quality, price, and production standards or production volumes to achieve profitability. Our failure to develop these manufacturing processes and capabilities in a timely manner could prevent us from achieving positive results of operations and cash flows.\nOur manufacturing operations in the U.S. depend primarily on one facility. If this facility is destroyed or we experience any manufacturing difficulties, disruptions, or delays, this could limit supply of our product or adversely affect our ability to sell products or conduct our clinical trials, and our business would be adversely impacted.\nAll the manufacturing of our product candidates takes place at our single U.S. facility. If regulatory, manufacturing, or other problems require us to discontinue production at this facility, we will not be able to supply our product candidates to patients or have supplies for any clinical trials, which would adversely impact our business. If this facility or the equipment in it is significantly damaged or destroyed by fire, flood, power loss, or similar events, we may not be able to quickly or inexpensively replace our manufacturing capacity or replace the facility at all. In the event of a temporary or protracted loss of this facility or equipment, we might not be able to transfer manufacturing to another third party. Even if we could transfer manufacturing from one facility to another, the shift would likely be expensive and time-consuming, particularly since an alternative facility would need to comply with the cGTP or cGMP (if applicable) regulatory and quality standard requirements and, if applicable, FDA approval would be required before any products manufactured at that facility could be made commercially available.\nOur financial condition may impair our ability to obtain credit terms with our suppliers.\nOur revenues may be dependent and our reimbursement arrangement may provide us with extended payment terms. However, our financial condition may make it difficult for us to continue to receive payment terms from our suppliers or vendors making demand for adequate assurance, which could include a demand for payment-in-advance. If we are unable to obtain reasonable payment terms or if any of our material vendors or suppliers were to successfully demand payment-in-advance, it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nAn active trading market for our common stock may not continue to develop or be sustained.\nAlthough our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market, or NASDAQ, we cannot assure you that an active, liquid trading market for our shares will continue to develop or be sustained. If an active market for our common stock does not continue to develop or is not sustained, it may be difficult for you to sell shares quickly or without depressing the market price for the shares or to sell your shares at all.\nThe trading price of the shares of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile, and you may not be able to resell some or all your shares at a desired price.\nOur stock price has been highly volatile during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018, with closing stock prices ranging from a high of $38.97 per share to a low of $12.11 per share. The stock market in general, and the market for biotech companies in particular, have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. Because of this volatility, investors in our stock may not be able to sell their common stock at or above the price paid for the shares. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:\n\u25cf actual or anticipated variations in our operating results;\n\u25cf changes in financial estimates by us or by any securities analysts who might cover our stock;\n\u25cf the timing and results of our product development plans\n\u25cf failure or discontinuation of any of our development programs;\n\u25cf conditions or trends in our industry;\n\u25cf stock market price and volume fluctuations of comparable companies and, in particular, those that operate in the biotech industry;\n\u25cf announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, or divestitures;\n\u25cf developments or disputes concerning patent applications, issued patents, or other proprietary rights;\n\u25cf announcements of investigations or regulatory scrutiny of our operations or lawsuits filed against us;\n\u25cf capital commitments;\n\u25cf investors\u2019 general perception of our company and our business;\n\u25cf recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u25cf announcements and expectations of additional financing efforts; and\n\u25cf sales of our common stock, including sales by our directors and officers or specific stockholders.\nIn addition, in the past, stockholders have initiated class action lawsuits against biotechnology companies following periods of volatility in the market prices of these companies\u2019 stock. We are currently a party to such litigation and may be in the future due to price volatility. Such litigation could cause us to incur substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources from the operation of our business.\nIf equity research analysts do not continue to publish research or reports or publish unfavorable research or reports about us, our business or our industry, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that equity research analysts publish about us and our business. Presently we have only limited research coverage by equity research analysts. Equity research analysts may elect not to initiate or continue to provide research coverage of our common stock, and such lack of research coverage may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. We have no control over the analysts or the content and opinions included in their reports. The price of our stock could decline if one or more equity research analysts downgrade our stock or issue other unfavorable commentary or research. If one or more equity research analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. If our stockholders sell, or the market perceives that our stockholders intend to sell, substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly.\nIn addition, we have filed registration statements on Form S-8 registering the issuance of shares of common stock subject to options or other equity awards issued or reserved for future issuance under our equity incentive plans. Shares registered under these registration statements on Form S-8 are available for sale in the public market subject to vesting arrangements and exercise of existing options, the grant of new options in the future, and the restrictions of Rule 144 in the case of our affiliates.\nThe issuance of additional stock in connection with financings, acquisitions, investments, our stock incentive plans or otherwise will dilute all other stockholders.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue up to 250,000,000 shares of common stock and up to 25,000,000 shares of preferred stock with such rights and preferences as may be determined by our board of directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d). Subject to compliance with applicable rules and regulations, we may issue our shares of common stock or securities convertible into our common stock from time to time in connection with a financing, acquisition, investment, our stock incentive plans or otherwise. Any such issuance could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.\nOur executive officers and directors and their affiliates own a significant percentage of our issued and outstanding common stock and can exercise significant influence over matters submitted to stockholders for approval.\nAs of January 7, 2019, our executive officers and directors and their affiliates beneficially owned approximately 42.5% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, if these stockholders were to choose to act together, they could exert a significant degree of influence over matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, as well as our management and affairs. For example, these persons, if they choose to act together, could have significant influence on the election of directors and approval of any merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all our assets, including a transaction on terms that other stockholders may desire.\nOur Restated Certificate of Incorporation, our Restated Bylaws, and Delaware law could deter a change of our management, which could discourage or delay offers to acquire us.\nCertain provisions of Delaware law and of our Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, and by-laws, could discourage or make it more difficult to accomplish a proxy contest or other change in our management or the acquisition of control by a holder of a substantial amount of our voting stock. It is possible that these provisions could make it more difficult to accomplish, or could deter, transactions that stockholders may otherwise consider to be in their best interests or in our best interests. These provisions include:\n\u25cf we have a classified Board requiring that members of the Board be elected in different years, which lengthens the time needed to elect a new majority of the Board;\n\u25cf our Board is authorized to issue up to 25,000,000 shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could be issued by our Board to increase the number of outstanding shares or change the balance of voting control and thwart a takeover attempt;\n\u25cf stockholders are not entitled to remove directors other than by a two-thirds vote and only for cause;\n\u25cf stockholders cannot call a special meeting of stockholders;\n\u25cf we require all stockholder actions be taken at a meeting of our stockholders, and not by written consent; and\n\u25cf stockholders must give advance notice to nominate directors or submit proposals for consideration at stockholder meetings.\nIn addition, we are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which regulates corporate acquisitions by prohibiting Delaware corporations from engaging in specified business combinations with particular stockholders of those companies. These provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control transaction. They could also have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for our common stock, including transactions that may be in your best interests. These provisions may also prevent changes in our management or limit the price that investors are willing to pay for our stock.\nA material weakness in internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nAs discussed in Item 9A - Controls and Procedures, we have identified material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting through our evaluation of our controls at October 31, 2018. Our material weaknesses consist of:\n\u25cf insufficient internal controls related to information technology general controls in the areas of user access, user provisioning, and change management over certain systems that support the financial reporting process;\n\u25cf inadequate documentation of period end financial disclosure and reporting processes;\n\u25cf ineffective controls related to the documentation and completeness of the Company\u2019s stock-based compensation expense; and\n\u25cf inadequate review procedures and segregation of duties over processing sales invoices.\nA material weakness could result in a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements requiring a restatement of the affected financial statements. A material misstatement and resulting restatement entail numerous risks, including the following:\n\u25cf We could be subject to civil litigation, including class action shareholder actions arising out of or relating to a restatement, which litigation, if decided against us, could require us to pay substantial judgments, settlements or other penalties;\n\u25cf Negative publicity relating to a restatement may adversely affect our business and the market price of our common stock;\n\u25cf Management\u2019s focus on achieving our business objectives may be diverted to addressing (i) the restatement (ii) customers\u2019, employees\u2019, investors\u2019 and regulators\u2019 questions and concerns regarding the restatement (iii) any negative impact on the Company\u2019s public image with our customers and in the financial market caused by the restatement, and (iv) any subsequent litigation that may result from the restatement;\n\u25cf The SEC may review a restatement and require further amendment of our public filings; and\n\u25cf We may incur significant expenses associated with preparing and filing a restatement.\nEach of these risks described above could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nBecause we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, will be your sole source of gains and you may never receive a return on your investment.\nYou should not rely on an investment in our common stock to provide dividend income. We have not declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock to date and have no plans to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future. Investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock.\nWe incur costs and demands upon management because of being a public company.\nAs a public company listed in the United States, we are incurring, and will continue to incur, significant legal, accounting and other costs. These costs could negatively affect our financial results. In addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including regulations implemented by the SEC and stock exchanges, may increase legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If, notwithstanding our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards, we fail to comply, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be harmed.\nFailure to comply with these rules also might make it more difficult for us to obtain some types of insurance, including directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance, and we might be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. The impact of these events could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, on committees of our board of directors or as members of senior management", "PERMNO": 90539, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "PTE"}
