{"cik": "1485003", "company": "Sesen Bio, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-28", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nOur business is subject to substantial risks and uncertainties. The occurrence of any of the following risks and uncertainties, either alone or taken together, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. In these circumstances, the market price of our common shares could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Risks and uncertainties of general applicability and additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital\nWe have incurred significant losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future.\nWe are a specialty pharmaceutical company with a limited operating history. Over the past few years, we have focused primarily on developing our lead product candidate, Vicineum. Since our inception, we have received no revenues from sales of our products, have incurred significant operating losses and expect to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future as we continue the clinical development of Vicineum for the treatment of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG and seek marketing approval from the FDA. We had net losses of $0.3 million, $22.4 million and $107.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We incurred negative cash flows from operating activities of $68.9 million, $30.8 million and $37.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $162.6 million, net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) of $194.0 million and an accumulated deficit of $316.3 million. We have financed our operations to date primarily through private placements of our common stock, preferred stock, common stock warrants and convertible bridge notes, venture debt borrowings, our initial public offering (\"IPO\"), our follow-on public offerings, sales effected in at-the-market (\"ATM\") offerings and, our out-licensing and OUS business development partnership agreements. The majority of our revenue to date has been from milestone payments received under our out-licensing and OUS business development partnership agreements. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses over the next several years. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year.\nWe expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future, and we expect these losses to increase as we:\n\u2022continue our clinical development of Vicineum for the treatment of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG;\n\u2022seek marketing approval for Vicineum for the treatment of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG in the United States and the European Union;\n\u2022establish a commercialization infrastructure and scale up external manufacturing and distribution capabilities to commercialize Vicineum for the treatment of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG, if approved;\n\u2022adapt our regulatory compliance efforts to incorporate requirements applicable to marketed drugs;\n\u2022seek and conduct combination trials of one or more of our product candidates;\n\u2022seek to develop additional product candidates;\n\u2022in-license or acquire the rights to other products, product candidates or technologies; and\n\u2022maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with drug development and commercialization, we are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of expenses or when, or if, we will be able to achieve profitability. If we are required by regulatory authorities to perform trials in addition to those expected or if there are any delays in the initiation and completion of our clinical trials or the development of any of our product candidates, our expenses could increase.\nWith the exception of specified regulatory, development and commercial milestones under our out-licensing and OUS business development partnership agreements, we currently have no source of revenue and may never become profitable.\nOur ability to become and remain profitable depends on our ability to generate revenue. Although we may be entitled to certain payments under our out-licensing and OUS business development partnership agreements, neither we nor any of our business development partners have commercialized any of our product candidates. We do not expect to generate significant revenue from the development of our product candidates unless and until we or one of our business development partners obtain marketing approval for, and commercialize, Vicineum for the treatment of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG. Our ability to generate revenue from Vicineum for the treatment of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022our ability to obtain regulatory approval for, and successfully commercialize, Vicineum for the treatment of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG;\n\u2022our ability to complete and submit applications to, and obtaining regulatory approval from, non-US regulatory authorities;\n\u2022the size of the markets in the territories for which we or our business development partners gain regulatory approval;\n\u2022our ability to find a suitable contract sales organization (\"CSO\") to help us market and promote Vicineum, if approved;\n\u2022our ability to develop and maintain effective medical affairs, sales, marketing and distribution to market and sell Vicineum, if approved;\n\u2022our ability to enter into and maintain commercially reasonable agreements with wholesalers, distributors and other third parties in our supply chain;\n\u2022our success in establishing a commercially viable price for Vicineum, if approved;\n\u2022our success in defending against potential competition and other developments in our market generally;\n\u2022our ability to manufacture commercial quantities of Vicineum at acceptable cost levels;\n\u2022our ability to obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors, including government payors; and\n\u2022our and our business development partners' ability to successfully complete development activities, including necessary clinical trials, for Vicineum for the treatment of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG.\nEven if Vicineum for the treatment of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG is approved for commercial sale, Vicineum may not gain market acceptance or achieve commercial success. If our addressable market is not as significant as we estimate, the indication approved by regulatory authorities is narrower than we expect or the treatment population is narrowed by competition, physician choice or clinical practice guidelines, we may not generate significant revenue from sales of Vicineum. In addition, we would anticipate incurring significant costs associated with commercializing Vicineum, if approved. We may not achieve profitability soon after generating product sales from Vicineum, if ever. If we are unable to generate product revenues from Vicineum, we will not become profitable and may be unable to continue operations without continued funding.\nEven if we achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become and remain profitable would depress the value of our company and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, maintain our development efforts, obtain drug approvals, diversify our offerings or continue our operations. A decline in the value of our company could also cause you to lose all or part of your investment.\nWe will need substantial additional funding. If we are unable to raise capital when needed, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs or commercialization efforts.\nWe are devoting substantial financial resources to our ongoing and planned activities, including a new Phase 3 clinical trial for Vicineum for the treatment of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG, and functions associated with operating as a public company. We expect to continue to spend substantial amounts to continue the clinical development of Vicineum for the treatment of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG, and, if approved, commercialize Vicineum. Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or any future commercialization efforts.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022the costs and timing of continuing the clinical development of Vicineum for the treatment of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG;\n\u2022the success of our commercialization of Vicineum for the treatment of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG, if approved;\n\u2022the outcome, timing and cost of the regulatory approval process for Vicineum for the treatment of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG by the FDA and comparable non-US regulatory authorities, including the potential for the FDA to require that we perform more studies and clinical trials than those we currently expect;\n\u2022the costs and timing of the implementation of commercial-scale manufacturing activities;\n\u2022our ability to establish and maintain commercial arrangements on favorable terms, if at all, particularly manufacturing, marketing and distribution arrangements for Vicineum for the treatment of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG;\n\u2022the costs and timing of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending any intellectual property-related claims;\n\u2022our obligation to make milestone, royalty and other payments to third party licensors under our in-licensing agreements;\n\u2022the extent to which we in-license or acquire rights to other products, product candidates or technologies; and\n\u2022the effect of competing technological and market developments.\nWe cannot be certain that additional funding will be available when needed on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts, when required or on acceptable terms, we also could be required to:\n\u2022seek out-licensing or commercialization partners to assist in the clinical development or commercialization of Vicineum for the treatment of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG in the United States and other markets;\n\u2022delay, limit, reduce or terminate the clinical development of Vicineum for the treatment of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG; or\n\u2022significantly curtail our operations.\nBased on our current operating plan, we believe that our cash and cash equivalents of $162.6 million as of December 31, 2021, will be sufficient to fund our operations into 2024; however, we have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and our capital resources may be utilized faster than we currently expect.\nFuture sales and issuances of shares of our common stock or rights to purchase shares of our common stock, including common stock purchase warrants and stock options, could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or product candidates.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, government or other third-party funding, licensing and OUS business development partnership agreements, strategic alliances and marketing and distribution arrangements and other commercial arrangements. We do not have any committed external source of funds other than the amounts payable under our out-licensing and OUS business development partnership agreements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, our stockholders\u2019 ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect our stockholders\u2019 rights as holders of our common stock.\nWe have also adopted the 2014 Plan to enable us and our subsidiaries to recruit and retain highly qualified employees, directors and consultants, provide those individuals with an incentive for productivity, and provide those individuals with an opportunity to share in our growth and value. As of December 31, 2021, we had an aggregate of 15.8 million stock options and RSUs outstanding under the 2014 Plan, our prior equity plan and inducement awards granted outside of our equity plans. In addition, as of December 31, 2021, we had 8.9 million shares of common stock available for grant under our 2014 Plan. Future equity incentive grants and issuances of shares of common stock under the 2014 Plan, or other grants outside of the 2014 Plan pursuant to inducement equity awards, may have an adverse effect on the market price of shares of our common stock.\nFurther, debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends.\nIf we raise additional funds through government or other third-party funding, licensing or OUS business development partnership agreements, strategic alliances or marketing and distribution arrangements, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market products or product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nRisks Related to Clinical Development and Regulatory Approval of Vicineum\nWe are dependent on our lead product candidate, Vicineum for the treatment of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG. If we are unable to obtain marketing approval for or successfully commercialize our lead product candidate, either alone or through an out-license or OUS business development partnership, or experience significant delays in doing so, our business could be materially harmed.\nWe currently have no products approved for sale and have invested a significant portion of our efforts and financial resources in the development of Vicineum. On August 13, 2021, we received a CRL from the FDA indicating that the FDA had determined that it could not approve the BLA for Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC in its present form. On August 20, 2021, we withdrew our MAA to the EMA for Vysyneum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC in order to pause\nour plans to pursue regulatory approval of Vysyneum in the European Union until there is more clarity from the FDA on next steps for Vicineum in the United States. In October and December 2021, we participated in a CMC Type A Meeting and a Clinical Type A Meeting, respectively, with the FDA to discuss issues raised in the CRL and to discuss design elements of an additional Phase 3 clinical trial for Vicineum, which the FDA confirmed will be required for a potential resubmission of a BLA. Following these Type A Meetings, we believe we have greater clarity of the requirements for potential resubmission of a BLA. We have a Type C Meeting scheduled with the FDA for March 28, 2022, in which we expect to discuss the study protocol for the additional Phase 3 clinical trial that we plan to conduct for potential resubmission of a BLA for Vicineum for the treatment of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG.\nWe may be unable to address the issues identified in the CRL from the FDA or resubmit a BLA for Vicineum, or address the concerns identified in the EMA Withdrawal Assessment Report or resubmit our MAA for Vysyneum, including because of a lack of capital or otherwise.\nEven if the issues identified in the CRL or the concerns identified in the EMA Withdrawal Assessment Report are resolved to the satisfaction of the FDA or the EMA, respectively, the FDA and the European Commission retain the right not to approve a BLA or MAA, respectively, or to require additional information, or to raise additional issues with regard to regulatory approval, which could further delay or prevent its approval or limit product labelling claims.\nOur prospects are substantially dependent on our ability and the ability of our out-licensing and OUS business development partners to obtain marketing approval for and commercialize Vicineum for the treatment of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG. In addition, either the substance of the issues identified by the FDA in the CRL, or the CRL itself, or the concerns identified in the EMA Withdrawal Assessment Report could have an adverse impact on future efforts to obtain marketing authorization for Vicineum from other non-US regulatory authorities, or on our future efforts to commercialize Vicineum and gain acceptance of Vicineum from third party payors. The success of Vicineum will depend on several factors, including the following:\n\u2022successfully completing the clinical development of Vicineum for the treatment of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG;\n\u2022addressing the issues identified in the CRL we received from the FDA and the concerns identified in the EMA Withdrawal Assessment Report;\n\u2022receiving marketing approvals from the FDA, the European Commission or comparable non-US regulatory authorities, including our ability to address the issues identified by the FDA in the CRL or the EMA Withdrawal Assessment Report;\n\u2022developing and maintaining the commercial manufacturing supply and distribution chain for Vicineum;\n\u2022performance of our current and future out-licensing or OUS business development partners;\n\u2022the extent of any required post-marketing approval commitments to applicable regulatory authorities;\n\u2022obtaining and maintaining patent, trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity, both in the United States and internationally;\n\u2022protecting our rights in our intellectual property portfolio;\n\u2022launching commercial sales, if and when marketing approval is received;\n\u2022demonstrating an acceptable safety profile prior to and following any marketing approval;\n\u2022obtaining marketplace acceptance, if approved, by patients, the medical community and third-party payors;\n\u2022establishing and maintaining pricing sufficient to realize a meaningful return on our investment; and\n\u2022competition with other therapies.\nIf we or our OUS business development partners are unable to develop, receive marketing approval for, or successfully commercialize Vicineum or experience delays as a result of any of these factors or otherwise, our business could be materially harmed.\nIf additional clinical trials of Vicineum for the treatment of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the FDA, the EMA or other non-US regulatory authorities or do not otherwise produce favorable results, we will be unable to complete the development and potential commercialization of Vicineum for the treatment of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG.\nBefore obtaining marketing approval from regulatory authorities for the sale of Vicineum for the treatment of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG, we must complete pre-clinical development and conduct extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of Vicineum in humans. In order to address the issues identified in the CRL we received from the FDA for the BLA for Vicineum and the concerns\nidentified in the EMA Withdrawal Assessment Report, we will need to complete one or more additional clinical trials. Such trials will require us to incur substantial additional costs and will delay the potential commercialization of Vicineum for the treatment of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG. Clinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and is uncertain as to outcome. A failure of one or more clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing. Further, the outcome of pre-clinical studies and early clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials, and preliminary results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results.\nEven if such clinical trials are successfully completed as planned, the results may not support approval of Vicineum for the treatment of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG under the laws and regulations of the FDA, the European Commission or comparable non-US regulatory authorities. We cannot be certain that additional clinical data will demonstrate Vicineum is both safe and effective for its intended uses to the satisfaction of the FDA, the EMA or comparable non-US regulatory authorities. Pre-clinical and clinical data and analyses are often able to be interpreted in different ways. Even if we view our results favorably, we may be unable to demonstrate safety and efficacy of Vicineum for the treatment of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG to the satisfaction of the FDA, the EMA or other non-US regulatory authorities. If a regulatory authority has a different view, we may still fail to obtain regulatory approval of Vicineum. This, in turn, would prevent us from commercializing Vicineum and our ability to generate revenues in the future would be materially impaired.\nWe may not be able to develop a more sensitive bioanalytical assay which is needed for the additional Phase 3 clinical trial for Vicineum for the treatment of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG.\nWe will need to develop a more sensitive bioanalytical assay for the additional Phase 3 clinical trial for Vicineum for the treatment of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG than was used in our prior VISTA Trial for Vicineum. This bioanalytical assay will be used to measure levels of Vicineum in the blood. The development of a new bioanalytical assay for a novel biologic like Vicineum can be complex. There is risk that an adequately sensitive bioanalytical assay may not be scientifically or economically feasible or that any new bioanalytical assay developed by us or a third party will not be accepted by the FDA or other comparable regulatory bodies. As a result, further development of Vicineum for the treatment of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG may be negatively impacted or delayed, which would have an adverse impact on our business.\nIf we experience any of a number of possible unforeseen events in connection with our clinical trials, potential marketing approval or commercialization of Vicineum for the treatment of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG could be delayed or prevented.\nWe may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, clinical trials that could delay or prevent our ability to receive marketing approval or commercialize Vicineum for the treatment of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG that we may develop, including:\n\u2022clinical trials of Vicineum may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon the development of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG;\n\u2022enrollment in these clinical trials may be slower or more challenging than we anticipate, or patients may drop out of these clinical trials at a higher rate than we anticipate;\n\u2022our third-party contractors may fail to comply with regulatory requirements, including GCP or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner, or at all;\n\u2022inspection of the clinical trial operations, trial sites or manufacturing facilities by the FDA or other comparable non-US regulatory authorities could result in findings of non-compliance and the imposition of a clinical suspension or termination;\n\u2022regulators or IRBs/Ethics Committees may delay or not authorize us or our investigators to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site;\n\u2022we may experience delays or fail to reach agreement with the FDA or a comparable non-US regulatory authority on a trial design that we are able to execute;\n\u2022we may be unable to identify and maintain a sufficient number of trial sites, many of which may already be engaged in other clinical trial programs, including for the same indications as our clinical trials;\n\u2022we may experience delays in reaching, or fail to reach, agreement on acceptable clinical trial contracts or clinical trial protocols with prospective trial sites;\n\u2022trial sites and investigators may deviate from clinical trial protocols or otherwise fail to conduct the trial in accordance with regulatory requirements, and investigators may drop out of the clinical trial;\n\u2022trial sites may withdraw from our clinical trials, including as a result of changing standards of care or ineligibility of a site to participate in our clinical trials;\n\u2022we may decide, or regulators or IRBs/Ethics Committees or other reviewing entities, including comparable non-US regulatory authorities, may require us to suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements including GCP or a finding that the patients are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;\n\u2022the cost of clinical trials of Vicineum for the treatment of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG may be greater than we anticipate;\n\u2022we may receive feedback from DSMBs or the FDA, or a comparable non-US regulatory authority, that might require modification to the protocol for the clinical trial or performance of additional studies before clinical trials may continue;\n\u2022as a clinical trial proceeds, or as the results of earlier stage studies or concurrent studies become available, we may determine that we need to modify the protocol and/or other aspects of the clinical trial before it may continue;\n\u2022the FDA, a comparable non-US regulatory authority, or we may decide to, or a DSMB may recommend to, suspend or terminate clinical trials at any time for safety issues or for any other reason;\n\u2022the supply or quality of Vicineum or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials of Vicineum may be insufficient or inadequate;\n\u2022Vicineum may have undesirable side effects or other unexpected characteristics, causing us or our investigators, regulators or IRBs/Ethics Committees to suspend or terminate the trials;\n\u2022lack of adequate funding to continue a clinical trial, including the occurrence of unforeseen costs due to enrollment delays, requirements to conduct additional clinical trials or increased expenses associated with the services of our CROs and other third parties; and\n\u2022changes in applicable laws, governmental regulations or administrative actions.\nWe rely on CROs and clinical trial sites to ensure the proper and timely conduct of our clinical trials, and while we have agreements governing their activities, we have limited control over their actual performance. Any delays in completing our clinical trials will increase our costs, slow down our development and regulatory submission process for Vicineum for the treatment of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG and jeopardize our ability to obtain regulatory approval, commence commercial sales and generate revenues, if Vicineum for the treatment of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG is ultimately approved.\nFurther, conducting clinical trials outside of the United States, as we have done historically for Vicineum (both for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC and for the treatment of SCCHN) and as we may decide to do in the future, presents additional risks that may delay completion of our clinical trials. These risks include the failure of enrolled patients in countries outside of the United States to adhere to clinical protocol as a result of differences in healthcare services or cultural customs, managing additional administrative burdens associated with non-US regulatory frameworks, as well as political and economic risks relevant to such countries.\nIf we are required to conduct additional clinical trials or other testing of Vicineum for the treatment of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG beyond those that we currently contemplate, if we are unable to successfully complete clinical trials of Vicineum or other testing, if the results of these trials or tests are not favorable or are only modestly favorable or if there are safety concerns, we may:\n\u2022be delayed in obtaining marketing approval for Vicineum for the treatment of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG;\n\u2022not obtain marketing approval at all;\n\u2022obtain approval for indications or patient populations that are not as broad as intended or desired;\n\u2022obtain approval with labeling that includes significant use or distribution restrictions or safety warnings, or is subject to a REMS;\n\u2022be subject to additional post-marketing testing requirements; or\n\u2022have Vicineum removed from the market after obtaining marketing approval.\nOur product development costs will also increase if we experience delays in testing or marketing approvals. We do not know whether any of our pre-clinical studies or clinical trials will begin as planned, will need to be restructured or will be completed\non schedule, or at all. Significant pre-clinical or clinical trial delays also could shorten any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize Vicineum for the treatment of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG or allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do and impair our ability to successfully commercialize Vicineum for the treatment of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG.\nIf we experience delays or difficulties in the enrollment of patients in clinical trials, our receipt of necessary regulatory approvals could be delayed or prevented.\nWe may not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials for our product candidates if we are unable to locate and enroll a sufficient number of patients to participate in these trials as required by the FDA or similar non-US regulatory authorities. We have previously experienced difficulties with clinical trial enrollment and retention, which led to the early termination of our Phase 3 trial of Vicineum for the treatment of SCCHN in 2008, and we may experience difficulties in patient enrollment in our clinical trials in the future for a variety of reasons.\nSubject enrollment is affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u2022the severity of the disease under investigation;\n\u2022the eligibility criteria for the clinical trial in question;\n\u2022the size of the patient population for the disease;\n\u2022the size of the patient population required for statistically significant analysis of the clinical trial\u2019s primary endpoints;\n\u2022the design of the clinical trial;\n\u2022the clinicians' and patients' perceived risks and benefits of the product candidate under study, including relative to alternative treatments;\n\u2022the efforts to facilitate timely enrollment in clinical trials;\n\u2022the patient referral practices of physicians;\n\u2022any ongoing clinical trials conducted by competitors for the same indication;\n\u2022the risk that patients enrolled in clinical trials will drop out of the clinical trials before completion;\n\u2022the ability to monitor patients adequately during and after treatment; and\n\u2022the proximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective patients.\nFurther, our ability to successfully initiate, enroll and complete a clinical trial in any country outside of the United States, should we decide to do so, is subject to numerous risks unique to conducting business in such countries, including:\n\u2022difficulty in establishing or managing relationships with CROs and physicians;\n\u2022different or additional standards for the conduct of clinical trials;\n\u2022absence in some countries of established groups with sufficient regulatory expertise for review of the protocols associated with our product candidates;\n\u2022ensuring that clinical trial quality is sufficient to meet the standards of the FDA or other regulatory authorities;\n\u2022our inability to locate qualified local consultants, physicians and partners; and\n\u2022the potential burden of complying with a variety of non-US laws, medical standards and regulatory requirements, including the regulation of pharmaceutical and biotechnology products and treatments.\nIn addition, our clinical trials will compete with other clinical trials for other product candidates that are in the same therapeutic areas as our product candidates, and this competition will reduce the number and types of patients available to us, because some patients who might have opted to enroll in our trials may instead opt to enroll in a trial being conducted by one of our competitors. Since the number of qualified clinical investigators is limited, we expect to conduct some of our clinical trials at the same clinical trial sites that some of our competitors use, which will reduce the number of patients who are available for our clinical trials in such clinical trial site. Moreover, because our product candidates represent a departure from more commonly used methods for cancer treatment, potential patients and their doctors may be inclined to use conventional therapies, such as chemotherapy, rather than enroll patients in any of our clinical trials.\nOur inability to enroll a sufficient number of patients for our clinical trials would result in significant delays, could require us to abandon one or more clinical trials altogether and could delay or prevent our receipt of necessary regulatory approvals. Enrollment delays in our clinical trials may result in increased development costs for our product candidates, which would cause the value of our company to decline and limit our ability to obtain additional financing.\nVicineum for the treatment of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG may cause undesirable side effects, serious adverse events or have other properties that could delay or\nhalt clinical trials, delay or prevent its regulatory approval, limit the commercial profile of its labeling, if approved, or result in significant negative consequences following any marketing approval.\nUndesirable side effects or serious adverse events caused by Vicineum for the treatment of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt respective clinical trials and could result in a restrictive label or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other comparable non-US regulatory authorities.\nThere were no Grade 4 or Grade 5 serious adverse events that were considered by the clinical investigators to be related to Vicineum during the Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials of Vicineum for the treatment of NMIBC. There was one Grade 5 serious adverse event, or death, which was determined by the clinical investigator to be unrelated to Vicineum. The most common reported treatment-related adverse events were an abnormally frequent passage of small amounts of urine, blood in the urine and painful urination, the majority of which were considered to be mild or moderate in severity. No patients discontinued treatment due to a Vicineum-related adverse event during the Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials.\nAs of the May 29, 2019 data cutoff date, in patients across all cohorts (n=133) of our Phase 3 VISTA Trial of Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC, 88% experienced at least one adverse event, with 95% of adverse events being Grade 1 or 2. The most commonly reported treatment-related adverse events were dysuria (14%), hematuria (13%) and urinary tract infection (12%) - all of which are consistent with the profile of bladder cancer patients and the use of catheterization for treatment delivery. These adverse events were determined by the clinical investigators to be manageable and reversible, and only four patients (3%) discontinued treatment due to an adverse event. Serious adverse events, regardless of treatment attribution, were reported in 14% of patients. There were four treatment-related serious adverse events reported in three patients including acute kidney injury (Grade 3), pyrexia (Grade 2), cholestatic hepatitis (Grade 4) and renal failure (Grade 5 or death). There were no age-related increases in adverse events observed in the VISTA Trial.\nIn addition, side effects and serious adverse events or further safety or toxicity issues that we may experience in our clinical trials or in post-marketing experience, if approved, could lead to the FDA's or other comparable non-US regulatory authority's imposition of a REMS or other post-marketing obligations, which could hinder us from generating revenues or achieving profitability. Results of our clinical trials could reveal an unacceptably high severity and prevalence of side effects or serious adverse events. As a result, our clinical trials could be suspended or terminated, and the FDA or comparable non-US regulatory authorities could order us to cease further development or deny approval of Vicineum for the treatment of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG. The related drug-side effects or serious adverse events in our clinical trials could affect clinical trial patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete the clinical trial or result in potential product liability claims.\nAdditionally, if Vicineum for the treatment of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG receives marketing approval, and we or others later identify undesirable side effects or serious adverse events caused by Vicineum, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:\n\u2022we may suspend or be forced to suspend marketing of Vicineum for the treatment of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG;\n\u2022we may be obliged to conduct a product recall or product withdrawal;\n\u2022regulatory authorities may suspend, vary, or withdraw their approvals of Vicineum for the treatment of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG;\n\u2022regulatory authorities may order the seizure or recall of Vicineum;\n\u2022regulatory authorities may require additional warnings on the label or a REMS or other post-marketing obligations that could diminish the usage or otherwise limit the commercial success of Vicineum for the treatment of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG;\n\u2022we may be required to conduct post-marketing studies;\n\u2022we could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients;\n\u2022we could be required to pay fines and face other administrative, civil and criminal penalties; and\n\u2022our reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of Vicineum for the treatment of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG, if approved.\nWe will need to obtain regulatory authority approval of any proposed names for oportuzumab monatox for the treatment of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG, and any failure or delay associated with such naming approval may adversely impact our business.\nAlthough the FDA previously conditionally accepted the name Vicineum, and EMA previously conditionally accepted the name Vysyneum, for our product candidate, oportuzumab monatox, these approvals are subject to further and final review by FDA and EMA upon potential resubmission of our respective applications and at the time of regulatory authority review of such applications. If the FDA or EMA object to any proposed proprietary product name, we may be required to expend significant additional resources in an effort to identify a suitable proprietary product name that would qualify under applicable laws, not infringe the existing rights of third parties and be acceptable to the FDA and EMA, as applicable.\nThe marketing approval process is expensive, time-consuming and uncertain. As a result, we cannot predict when or if we, or any licensees or partners, will obtain marketing approval to commercialize Vicineum for the treatment of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG or any other product candidate.\nSecuring marketing approval requires the submission of extensive pre-clinical and clinical data and supporting information to regulatory authorities for each therapeutic indication to establish the product candidate\u2019s quality, safety, and efficacy. The process of obtaining marketing approvals, both in the United States and abroad, is expensive and may take many years, especially if additional clinical trials are required, if approval is obtained at all. In October and December 2021, we participated in a CMC Type A Meeting and Clinical Type A Meeting, respectively, with the FDA to discuss issues raised in the CRL and design elements of an additional Phase 3 clinical trial for Vicineum, which the FDA confirmed will be required for a potential resubmission of a BLA. We have a Type C Meeting scheduled with the FDA for March 28, 2022, in which we expect to discuss the study protocol for the additional Phase 3 clinical trial that we plan to conduct for potential resubmission of a BLA for Vicineum for the treatment of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG.\nSecuring marketing approval also requires the submission of information about the product manufacturing process to, and inspection of manufacturing facilities by, the regulatory authorities. The FDA or other comparable non-US regulatory authorities may determine that any product candidate that we may develop is not safe, effective or of appropriate quality, is only moderately effective or has undesirable or unintended side effects, toxicities or other characteristics that preclude our obtaining marketing approval or prevent or limit commercial use. Any marketing approval we ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-approval commitments that render the approved product not commercially viable.\nThe different requirements and expectations of the non-US regulatory authorities compared with the FDA may lengthen the regulatory review process, require us to conduct additional studies or clinical trials, increase our development costs, lead to changes in regulatory positions and interpretations, delay or prevent approval and commercialization of these product candidates or lead to significant post approval limitations or restrictions. If we experience delays in obtaining regulatory approvals, the commercial prospects for our product candidates may be harmed and our ability to generate revenues will be materially impaired.\nFailure to obtain marketing approval in non-US jurisdictions would prevent our product candidates from being marketed abroad, and any approval we are granted for our product candidates in the United States would not assure approval of product candidates in non-US jurisdictions.\nIn order to market and sell any product candidate that we may develop outside of the United States, we or our third-party licensees or commercialization partners must obtain separate marketing approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements. The approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing. The time required to obtain approval may differ substantially from that required to obtain FDA approval. The regulatory approval process outside the United States generally includes all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval. In addition, in many countries outside the United States it is required that the product be approved for reimbursement before the product can be sold in that country. We or these third parties may not obtain approvals from regulatory authorities outside the United States on a timely basis, if at all. For example, on March 5, 2021, we submitted our MAA to the EMA for Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC under the EMA\u2019s centralized procedure. On August 20, 2021, we withdrew our MAA to the EMA for Vysyneum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC. We have decided to pause our plans to pursue regulatory approval of Vysyneum in the European Union until there is more clarity from the FDA on the next steps for Vicineum in the United States. Additionally, on October 20, 2021, the EMA issued its Withdrawal Assessment Report relating to our MAA for Vysyneum, as is consistent with the EMA\u2019s standard practice when an MAA is withdrawn. The Assessment Report reflects the initial assessment and corresponding questions from the EMA and identifies major objections in the areas of quality, good clinical practice, efficacy and safety. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions, and approval by one regulatory authority outside the United States does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions or by the FDA. We may not be able to file for marketing approvals and may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our products in any market. If we are unable to obtain approval of our product candidates by regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions, the commercial prospects of our product candidates may be significantly diminished, and our business prospects could decline.\nWe face substantial competition, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing products before or more successfully than we do.\nThe development and commercialization of new biologics products is highly competitive. We face competition with respect to Vicineum for the treatment of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG from both large and small pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and other research organizations. There are a number of large pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that currently market and sell products or are pursuing the development of products for the treatment of NMIBC. For instance, in January 2020, the FDA approved Merck & Co., Inc.'s Keytruda (pembrolizumab) as a systemic monotherapy to treat patients with BCG-unresponsive NMIBC with CIS with or without papillary tumors who are ineligible for or have elected not to undergo cystectomy. In addition, FerGene Inc. is developing Adstiladrin (nadofaragene firadenovec (rAd-IFN/Syn3) for BCG-unresponsive NMIBC for the United States market. On May 17, 2020, the FDA issued a CRL that indicated outstanding questions regarding CMC = issues of Adstiladrin. In September 2020, CG Oncology (CG0070, a recombinant adenovirus type 5, same type as Adstiladrin) initiated a Phase 3 study for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive patients with expected primary and study completion dates of December 2022 and December 2024, respectively. In December 2020, ImmunityBio (Anktiva/N-803 in combination with BCG) released preliminary Phase 2 data for the CIS cohort and is expected to file its BLA following a meeting with the FDA in the first quarter of 2022. However, the Phase 2 trial did not include a BCG only control arm. In May 2020, the preliminary results of the Phase 2 study of Tecentriq for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive CIS patients were presented at ASCO by the NCI (National Cancer Institute) which sponsored the trial. The data showed that the trial did not meet its primary endpoint and further development of Tecentriq remains uncertain. Finally, another route of administration for checkpoint inhibitors is currently being evaluated by Pfizer with the subcutaneous administration of Sasanlimab (PF-06801591) for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC patients. There is intense and rapidly evolving competition in the biotechnology, biopharmaceutical and antibody fragment and immuno-oncology therapeutics fields. Some of these competitive products and therapies are based on scientific approaches that are similar to our approach, and others are based on entirely different approaches.\nOur commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than product candidates that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market.\nIn addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors, particularly Medicare, seeking to encourage the use of generic drug products. Generic products are currently being used as part of the standard of care for the indications that we are pursuing, and additional products are expected to become available on a generic basis over the coming years. If any product candidate that we may develop achieves marketing approval, we expect that it will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic products.\nMore established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their greater size, cash resources and institutional experience. Compared to us, many of our competitors may have significantly greater financial, technical and human resources. As a result of these factors, our competitors may obtain regulatory approval of their product candidates before we are able to, which may limit our ability to develop or commercialize our product candidates. Our competitors may also develop drugs that are safer, more effective, more widely used and less expensive than ours, and may also be more successful than us in manufacturing and marketing their products. These appreciable advantages could render our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of development and commercialization.\nOur product candidates may face competition from biosimilar products.\nWith the enactment of the BPCIA, abbreviated pathways for approval of biosimilar and interchangeable biological products were created. The BPCIA establishes legal authority for the FDA to review and approve biosimilars for marketing, as well as biosimilars that have been designated as \u201cinterchangeable\u201d with a previously approved biologic, or reference product. Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product cannot be approved by the FDA until 12 years after the reference product was approved under a full BLA. This period of regulatory exclusivity runs concurrently with, but is independent of, periods of patent protection for the reference product.\nWe believe that any of our product candidates, including Vicineum for the treatment of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG, approved as a biological product under a full BLA should qualify for a 12-year period of exclusivity. However:\n\u2022the United States Congress could amend the BPCIA to significantly shorten this exclusivity period as has been previously proposed; and\n\u2022a potential competitor could seek and obtain approval of its own BLA during our exclusivity period instead of seeking approval of a biosimilar version.\nThe BPCIA is complex and its provisions continue to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA and United States courts. As a result, the ultimate impact, implementation and implications of the BPCIA are subject to uncertainty and could compromise the future commercial prospects for our biological products. Moreover, it is not yet clear the extent to which a biosimilar, once approved, may be substituted for any one of our reference products in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for pharmaceutical products; this will depend on a number of marketplace and regulatory factors that are still developing at both the federal and state levels of government.\nProduct liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to limit commercialization of Vicineum for the treatment of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG, if approved.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the use of Vicineum for the treatment of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that Vicineum for the treatment of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG caused injuries, we will incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u2022decreased demand for Vicineum for the treatment of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG;\n\u2022injury to our reputation and significant negative media attention;\n\u2022withdrawal of clinical trial patients;\n\u2022significant costs to defend the related litigation;\n\u2022substantial monetary awards to trial patients;\n\u2022loss of revenue;\n\u2022reduced time and attention of our management to pursue our business strategy; and\n\u2022the inability to commercialize Vicineum for the treatment of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG.\nWe currently hold $10.0 million CAD in product liability insurance coverage in the aggregate, with a per incident limit of $10.0 million CAD, which may not be adequate to cover all liabilities that we may incur. We would need to increase our insurance coverage if we expand our clinical development activities beyond historical levels. We would need to further increase our insurance coverage if Vicineum for the treatment of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG is approved, and we commence commercialization. Insurance coverage is increasingly expensive. We may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties\nWe will depend on Qilu for the development and commercialization of Vicineum in Greater China.\nOn July 30, 2020, we entered into the Qilu License Agreement. Under the terms of the Qilu License Agreement, Qilu has an exclusive license to manufacture, develop and commercialize Vicineum in Greater China, including mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. The timing and amount of any milestone and royalty payments we may receive under the Qilu License Agreement will depend in part on Qilu\u2019s efforts. We will also depend on Qilu to comply with all applicable laws relative to the manufacturing, development and commercialization of Vicineum in Greater China. We do not control the individual efforts of Qilu, and any failure by Qilu to devote sufficient time and effort to the manufacture, development and commercialization of Vicineum could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and operations, such as by a failure of Qilu to meet its obligations to us, including future milestone and royalty payments. In addition, if Qilu were to violate, or was alleged to have violated, any laws or regulations during the performance of its obligations for us, it is possible that we could suffer financial and reputational harm or other negative outcomes, including possible legal consequences.\nAny termination, breach or expiration of the Qilu License Agreement could have a material adverse effect on our financial position by reducing or eliminating the potential for us to receive milestones and royalties. In such an event, we may be required to devote additional efforts and to incur additional costs associated with pursuing the manufacture, development and commercialization of Vicineum in Greater China. If we breach our obligations under the Qilu License Agreement and are unable to cure such breach, Qilu may terminate the Qilu License Agreement and retain all rights to manufacture, develop and commercialize Vicineum in Greater China with no obligation to make any additional milestone or royalty payments. Qilu has the right to receive a refund of all amounts paid us in the event the Qilu License Agreement is terminated under certain\ncircumstances. In addition, the royalty rate is subject to reduction under certain circumstances, including when there is no valid claim of a licensed patent for Vicineum in a particular region or no data or regulatory exclusivity for Vicineum in a particular region.\nWe have entered into and may enter into additional OUS business development partnerships or out-license agreements with third parties for the commercialization or development of our product candidates. If our OUS business development partnerships or out-licenses are not successful, we may not be able to capitalize on the market potential of these product candidates.\nWe have sought and may seek additional third-party partners or licensees for development and commercialization of our product candidates, including Vicineum for the treatment of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG. Our current and likely commercialization partners or licensees include large and mid-size pharmaceutical companies, regional and national pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies. Our ability to generate revenues from these arrangements depend and will depend on our partners' or licensees' abilities and efforts to successfully perform the functions assigned to them in these arrangements.\nOUS business development partnerships and licenses involving our product candidates pose a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022partners or licensees have significant discretion in determining the amount and timing of efforts and resources that they will apply to these partnerships or licenses;\n\u2022partners or licensees may not perform their obligations as expected;\n\u2022partners or licensees may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial program, stop a clinical trial or abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new formulation of a product candidate for clinical testing;\n\u2022partners or licensees may not pursue commercialization and development of our product candidates that receive marketing approval or may elect not to continue or renew commercialization or development programs based on clinical trial results, changes in any such partner\u2019s or licensee\u2019s strategic focus or available funding, or external factors, such as an acquisition, that divert resources or create competing priorities;\n\u2022partners or licensees could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with our products or product candidates if the partners or licensees believe that competitive products are more likely to be successfully developed or can be commercialized under terms that are more economically attractive than ours;\n\u2022product candidates discovered under the partnership or license with us may be viewed by our partners or licensees as competitive with their own product candidates or products, which may cause partners or licensees to cease to devote resources to the commercialization of our product candidates;\n\u2022partners or licensees with marketing and distribution rights to one or more of our product candidates that achieve regulatory approval may not commit sufficient resources to the marketing and distribution of such product or products;\n\u2022partners or licensees could become involved in a business combination, which might deemphasize or terminate the commercialization or development of any product candidate licensed to it by us;\n\u2022disagreements with partners or licensees, including disagreements over proprietary rights, contract interpretation or the preferred course of development, might cause delays or termination of the research, development or commercialization of product candidates, might lead to additional responsibilities for us with respect to product candidates, or might result in litigation or arbitration, any of which would divert management attention and resources, be time-consuming and expensive;\n\u2022partners or licensees may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation;\n\u2022partners or licensees may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may expose us to litigation and potential liability; and\n\u2022commercialization partners or licenses may be terminated for the convenience of the partner or licensee and, if terminated, we could be required to raise additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable product candidates.\nOUS business development partnership agreements and licenses may not lead to commercialization or development of product candidates in the most efficient manner, or at all. If any partnerships or licenses that we enter into, do not result in the successful commercialization and development of products or if one of our partners or licensees terminates its agreement with us, we may not receive any future research funding or milestone or royalty payments under the partnership or license. All of the\nrisks relating to product development, regulatory approval and commercialization described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K also apply to the activities of any current or future OUS business development partners and licensees.\nAdditionally, if one of our partners or licensees terminates its agreement with us, we may find it more difficult to attract new partners or licensees and our perception in the business and financial communities could be harmed.\nIf we are unable to reach agreements with suitable new partners or licensees on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all, we may have to curtail the development of a product candidate, reduce or delay its development program or one or more of our other development programs, delay its potential commercialization or reduce the scope of any sales or marketing activities, or increase our expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense. If we elect to fund and undertake development or commercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional expertise and additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we fail to enter into partnerships and do not have sufficient funds or expertise to undertake the necessary development and commercialization activities, we may not be able to further develop our product candidates or bring them to market or continue to develop our product platform.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates.\nWe rely on domestic and international third-party CROs to monitor and manage data for our pre-clinical and clinical programs. We rely on these parties for execution of our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, and we control only some aspects of their activities. Nevertheless, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol and legal, regulatory and scientific standards, and our reliance on the CROs does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. We also rely on third parties to assist in conducting our pre-clinical studies in accordance with GLP and the Animal Welfare Act requirements. We and our CROs are required to comply with US federal regulations and GCP, which are international standards meant to protect the rights and health of patients and assure the credibility of clinical trial data that are enforced by the FDA and comparable non-US regulatory authorities for all of our product candidates in clinical development. Regulatory authorities enforce GCP through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and trial sites. If we or any of our CROs fail to comply with applicable GCP, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or comparable non-US regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications.\nOn October 27, 2021, the FDA published a Warning Letter (the \u201cFDA Warning Letter\u201d) issued to a former clinical investigator in our VISTA trial for Vicineum arising from a 2021 FDA inspection related to the review of our BLA for Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC. We discontinued use of the clinical site and the clinical investigator over four years ago when we learned of professional misconduct by the clinical investigator that was unrelated to the VISTA trial. The FDA Warning Letter indicated that the clinical investigator did not comply with applicable statutory requirements and applicable regulations regarding conduct of clinical investigations. The clinical investigator's medical license was temporarily suspended on May 29, 2017, due to inaccurate recordkeeping, which was unassociated with Sesen Bio and the patients in the VISTA trial. We notified the FDA of the misconduct at that time. There was no evidence found that patients were harmed by the clinical investigator\u2019s actions. We included the corresponding patient data from the clinical site in the BLA submission to the FDA, which were thoroughly analyzed and discussed during the BLA review.\nWe cannot assure you that upon inspection by a given regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that any of our clinical trials comply with GCP requirements. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with product produced under cGMP requirements. Failure to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process.\nOur CROs are not our employees, and except for remedies available to us under our agreements with such CROs, we cannot control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our ongoing clinical, non-clinical and pre-clinical programs. If CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines or if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our protocols, regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our product candidates. As a result, our results of operations and the commercial prospects for our product candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase and our ability to generate revenues could be delayed.\nBecause we have relied and will continue to rely on third parties, our internal capacity to perform these functions is limited. Outsourcing these functions involves risk that third parties may not perform to our standards, may not produce results in a timely manner or may fail to perform at all. In addition, the use of third-party service providers requires us to disclose our proprietary information to these parties, which could increase the risk that this information will be misappropriated. We currently have a small number of employees, which limits the internal resources we have available to identify and monitor our third-party providers. To the extent we are unable to identify and successfully manage the performance of third-party service\nproviders in the future, our business may be adversely affected. Though we carefully manage our relationships with our CROs, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter challenges or delays in the future or that these delays or challenges will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and prospects.\nIf we lose our relationships with CROs, our product development efforts could be delayed.\nWe rely on domestic and international third-party vendors and CROs for pre-clinical studies and clinical trials related to our product development efforts. Switching or adding additional CROs would involve additional cost and requires management time and focus. Our CROs generally have the right to terminate their agreements with us in the event of an uncured material breach. In addition, some of our CROs have an ability to terminate their respective agreements or research projects with us pursuant to such agreements if it can be reasonably demonstrated that the safety of the patients participating in our clinical trials warrants such termination in accordance with the reasonable opinion of the relevant CRO. Identifying, qualifying and managing performance of third-party service providers can be difficult, time consuming and cause delays in our development programs. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new CRO commences work and the new CRO may not provide the same type or level of services as the original provider. If any of our relationships with our third-party CROs terminate, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative CROs or to do so on commercially reasonable terms.\nWe are dependent on third parties to formulate and manufacture Vicineum, which exposes us to a number of risks that may delay development, regulatory approval and commercialization of our products or result in higher product costs.\nIn September 2017, we completed the manufacturing of all Vicineum necessary for our VISTA Trial and for our CRADA with the NCI. In conjunction with this achievement, we ended our manufacturing activities at our facility in Winnipeg and completed the technology transfer process to outsource future Vicineum clinical and commercial to third-party manufacturers.\nOn August 13, 2021, we received a CRL from the FDA indicating that the FDA had determined that it could not approve the BLA for Vicineum in its present form and, among other things, raised CMC issues pertaining to a recent pre-approval inspection and product quality. At the CMC Type A Meeting held in October 2021, the FDA confirmed that Vicineum manufactured using the proposed commercial process is comparable to Vicineum used in prior clinical trials and that we can utilize Vicineum manufactured during process validation for any future clinical trials needed to address issues raised in the CRL, and that such trials can proceed while addressing CMC issues. Therefore, we have no current plans to re-build internal manufacturing capacity for Vicineum and we expect to continue to rely on third-party expertise in this area.\nOur reliance on third-party manufacturers exposes us to certain risks that we would not be subject to if we manufactured Vicineum ourselves, including:\n\u2022The development of manufacturing capabilities to produce clinical supply of Vicineum may require our third-party manufacturers to invest substantial additional funds and hire and retain technical personnel who have the necessary manufacturing experience. Our third-party manufacturers may fail to devote sufficient time and resources to develop the capabilities to manufacture Vicineum.\n\u2022Because of the complex nature of Vicineum, our third party manufacturers, or other third parties we rely on, may encounter difficulties in achieving the volume of production needed to satisfy our clinical supply demands, may not be able to achieve such volume at an acceptable cost, may experience technical issues that impact comparability, quality, or compliance with applicable regulations governing the manufacture of biological products, and may experience shortages of qualified personnel to adequately staff production operations.\n\u2022Our third-party manufacturers could default on their agreements with us to meet our requirements for supply of Vicineum, or they may terminate or decide not to renew their agreements with us, based on their own business priorities, at a time that is costly or damaging to us. If our third-party manufacturers were to terminate our arrangements or fail to meet our manufacturing demands, we may be delayed in our ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approval of Vicineum for the treatment of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG.\n\u2022It may be difficult or impossible for us to find replacement manufacturers on acceptable terms quickly, or at all. Identifying alternate manufacturers may be difficult because the number of potential manufacturers that have the necessary expertise to produce biologics is limited. Additionally, the FDA must approve any alternative manufacturer before we may use the alternative manufacturer to produce clinical supply of Vicineum.\n\u2022If any third-party manufacturer makes improvements in the manufacturing process for Vicineum, we may not own, or may have to share, the intellectual property rights to such improvements.\n\u2022A third-party manufacturer may gain knowledge from working with us that could be used to supply one of our competitors with a product that competes with ours.\nOur reliance on third-party manufacturers reduces our control over production and supply of Vicineum but does not relieve us of our responsibility to ensure compliance with applicable legal and regulatory standards. The FDA and other non-US\nregulatory authorities require that our product candidates and any products that we may eventually commercialize be manufactured according to cGMP and similar non-US standards. Methods of manufacture as well as validation of manufacturing procedures and quality control systems are reviewed by regulatory authorities, such as the FDA and other comparable non-US regulatory authorities, to determine their effect on the quality, purity and potency of product candidates. All such manufacturing procedures, validation programs and quality assessment activities must be properly documented in accordance with regulatory requirements. Any failure by our third-party manufacturers to comply with cGMP or similar non-US standards, including any failure to deliver sufficient quantities of product candidates in a timely manner, could lead to a delay in, or failure to obtain, regulatory approval of any of our product candidates, including Vicineum for the treatment of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG. For example, we may be unable to resolve the issues raised in the CRL pertaining to a recent pre-approval inspection and product quality.\nIn addition, a failure by our third-party manufactures to comply with cGMP or similar non-US standards could be the basis for the FDA or any other non-US regulatory authorities to issue a warning or untitled letter, withdraw approvals for product candidates previously granted to us, or take other regulatory or legal action, including recall or seizure, total or partial suspension of production, suspension of ongoing clinical trials, refusal to approve pending applications or supplemental applications, detention of product, refusal to permit the import or export of products, injunction, imposing administrative or civil penalties, or pursuing criminal prosecution.\nIf we or our third-party manufacturers fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur significant costs.\nWe and our third-party manufacturers are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. From time to time and in the future, our operations may involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials, and produce hazardous waste products. We generally contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes. We cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from our use of hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties for failure to comply with such laws and regulations.\nAlthough we maintain workers\u2019 compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. We do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us in connection with our storage or disposal of biological, hazardous or radioactive materials.\nIn addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These current or future laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.\nFurther, with respect to the operations of our third-party contract manufacturers, it is possible that if they fail to operate in compliance with applicable environmental, health and safety laws and regulations or properly dispose of wastes associated with our products, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, suffer reputational harm or experience a disruption in the manufacture and supply of our product candidates or products.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for our technology and products, or if our licensors are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for the technology or products that we license from them, or if the scope of the patent protection obtained is not sufficiently broad, our competitors could develop and commercialize technology and products similar or identical to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our technology and products may be impaired.\nOur success depends in large part on our and our licensors\u2019 ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in the United States and other countries with respect to Vicineum and our other proprietary technology and product candidates. We and our licensors have sought to protect our proprietary position by filing patent applications in the United States and abroad related to our novel technologies and product candidates. The patent prosecution process is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications in jurisdictions of interest at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection. Moreover, in some circumstances, we do not have the right to control the preparation, filing and prosecution of patent applications, or to maintain the patents, covering technology that we license from third parties. Therefore, these patents and applications may not be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business. If such licensors fail to maintain such patents, or lose rights to those patents, the rights we have licensed may be reduced or eliminated.\nThe patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has in recent years been the subject of much litigation. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our and our licensors\u2019 patent rights are highly uncertain. Our and our licensors\u2019 pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued which protect our technology or products or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. In addition, the laws of non-US countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. For example, European patent law restricts the patentability of methods of treatment of the human body more than United States law does. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all. Therefore, we cannot know with certainty whether we or our licensors were the first to make the inventions claimed in our owned or licensed patents or pending patent applications, or that we or our licensors were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our owned or licensed patent rights are highly uncertain. Our pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued which protect our technology or products, in whole or in part, or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. In particular, during prosecution of any patent application, the issuance of any patents based on the application may depend upon our ability to generate additional pre-clinical or clinical data that support the patentability of our proposed claims. We may not be able to generate sufficient additional data on a timely basis, or at all. Moreover, changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection.\nMoreover, we may be subject to a third-party preissuance submission of prior art to the USPTO or become involved in opposition, derivation, reexamination, inter partes review, post-grant review or interference proceedings challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. An adverse determination in any such submission, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our technology or products and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize products without infringing third-party patent rights. In addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize current or future product candidates. In addition, invalidation of our patent rights by third parties could jeopardize the anticipated revenue streams from current licensees.\nEven if our owned and licensed patent applications issue as patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection, prevent competitors from competing with us or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. Our competitors may be able to circumvent our owned or licensed patents by developing similar or alternative technologies or products in a non-infringing manner.\nThe issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, and our owned and licensed patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. Such challenges may result in loss of exclusivity or freedom to operate or in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, in whole or in part, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and products. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on Vicineum and our other product candidates and technologies throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our or our licensors\u2019 intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws and practices of countries outside the United States do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States. Moreover, the intellectual property laws of the United States change over time. For example, several United States Supreme Court cases have redefined what is considered to be patentable subject matter. Consequently, we and our licensors may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our and our licensors\u2019 inventions in all countries inside or outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using our and our licensors\u2019 inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and may export infringing products to territories where we or our licensors have patent protection, but where enforcement is not as strong as in the United States. These products may compete with our products in jurisdictions where we do not have any issued patents and our patent claims or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from so competing.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in non-US jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of\npatents and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biopharmaceuticals, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our or our licensor\u2019s patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally in those countries. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in non-US jurisdictions could result in substantial cost and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our and our licensors\u2019 patents at risk of being invalidated or being interpreted narrowly and put our and our licensors\u2019 patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us or our licensors. We or our licensors may not prevail in any lawsuits that we or our licensors initiate, and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful.\nThe laws of certain countries outside of the US may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and such laws may also be subject to change. For example, methods of treatment and manufacturing processes may not be patentable in certain jurisdictions, and the requirements for patentability may differ in certain countries, particularly developing countries. Furthermore, generic and/or biosimilar product manufacturers or other competitors may challenge the scope, validity or enforceability of our or our licensors\u2019 patents, requiring us or our licensors to engage in complex, lengthy and costly litigation or other proceedings.\nGeneric or biosimilar product manufacturers may develop, seek approval for, and generic versions or biosimilar versions, respectively, of our products. The FDA has published several guidance documents on biosimilar product development. If a biosimilar product is also found to be interchangeable with a reference product, it may be substituted for the reference product. Complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the process by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation, which are still being worked out by the FDA. If any of our product candidates are approved by the FDA, the approval of a biologic product biosimilar to or interchangeable with one of our products could have a material impact on our business. In particular, a biosimilar could be significantly less costly to bring to market and priced significantly lower than our products, if approved by the FDA.\nMany countries, including EU countries, have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled under certain circumstances to grant licenses to third parties. In those countries, we and our licensors may have limited remedies if patents are infringed or if we or our licensors are compelled to grant a license to a third party, which could materially diminish the value of those patents. This could limit our potential revenue opportunities. Accordingly, our and our licensors\u2019 efforts to enforce intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we own or license.\nWe have not yet registered our trademarks in all of our potential markets, and failure to secure those registrations could adversely affect our business.\nOur future trademark applications may not be allowed for registration, and our registered trademarks may not be maintained or enforced. During trademark registration proceedings, we may receive rejections from the USPTO or other applicable non-US intellectual property offices. Although we are given an opportunity to respond to those rejections, we may be unable to overcome such rejections, or have to expend additional resources to secure registrations, such as commencing cancellation proceedings against third-party trademark registrations to remove them as obstacles to our trademark applications. In addition, in the USPTO and in comparable agencies in many non-US jurisdictions, third parties are given an opportunity to oppose pending trademark applications and to seek to cancel registered trademarks. Opposition or cancellation proceedings may be filed against our trademarks, and our trademarks may not survive such proceedings. If we do not secure registrations for our trademarks, we may encounter more difficulty in enforcing them against third parties than we otherwise would.\nWe depend on our license agreements with Zurich, Micromet and XOMA, and if we cannot meet the requirements under the agreements, we could lose important rights to Vicineum, which could have material adverse effect on our business.\nWe have an exclusive license agreement with Zurich. Pursuant to the Zurich License Agreement, we were granted an exclusive license, with the right to sublicense, under certain patents primarily relating, in part, to our targeting agents, EpCAM chimera and immunoconjugates (including aspects of Vicineum for the treatment of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG and Vicineum for the treatment of SCCHN) and methods of use, to make, use, sell and import products that would otherwise infringe such patents in the field of the treatment, stasis and palliation of disease in humans. If we fail to meet our obligations under the Zurich License Agreement, Zurich may have the right to terminate our license, and upon the effective date of such termination, our right to use the licensed Zurich patent rights would end. To the extent such licensed technology or patent rights relate to our product candidates, we would expect to exercise all rights and remedies available to us, including attempting to cure any breach by us, and otherwise seek to preserve our rights under the patent rights licensed to us, but we may not be able to do so in a timely manner, at an acceptable cost to us or at all. Any uncured, material breach under the Zurich License Agreement could result in our loss of rights to practice the patent rights licensed to us under the Zurich License Agreement, and to the extent such patent rights and other technology relate to our product candidates or other of our compounds, it could have a material adverse effect on our commercialization efforts for our product candidates, including Vicineum for the treatment of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG and Vicineum for the treatment of SCCHN.\nWe also have a license agreement with Micromet, which grants us non-exclusive rights, with certain sublicense rights, for know-how and patents allowing exploitation of certain single chain antibody products. If we fail to meet our obligations under the Micromet License Agreement, Micromet may have the right to terminate our license, and upon the effective date of such termination, our right to use the licensed Micromet patent rights would end. To the extent such licensed technology or patent rights relate to our product candidates, we would expect to exercise all rights and remedies available to us, including attempting to cure any breach by us, and otherwise seek to preserve our rights under the patent rights licensed to us, but we may not be able to do so in a timely manner, at an acceptable cost to us or at all. Any uncured, material breach under the Micromet License Agreement could result in our loss of rights to practice the patent rights licensed to us under the Micromet License Agreement, and to the extent such patent rights and other technology relate to our product candidates or other of our compounds, it could have a material adverse effect on our commercialization efforts for our product candidates, including Vicineum for the treatment of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG and Vicineum for the treatment of SCCHN.\nWe also have a license agreement with XOMA, which grants us non-exclusive rights, with certain sublicense rights, to certain XOMA patent rights and know-how related to certain expression technology, including plasmids, expression strains, plasmid maps and production systems. If we fail to meet our obligations under the XOMA License Agreement, XOMA may have the right to terminate our license, and upon the effective date of such termination, our right to use the licensed XOMA patent rights and related know-how would end. To the extent such licensed technology or patent rights relate to our product candidates, we would expect to exercise all rights and remedies available to us, including attempting to cure any breach by us, and otherwise seek to preserve our rights under the patent rights licensed to us, but we may not be able to do so in a timely manner, at an acceptable cost to us or at all. Any uncured, material breach under the XOMA License Agreement could result in our loss of rights to practice the patent rights licensed to us under the XOMA License Agreement, and to the extent such patent rights and other technology relate to our product candidates or other of our compounds, it could have a material adverse effect on our commercialization efforts for our product candidates, including Vicineum for the treatment of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG and Vicineum for the treatment of SCCHN.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or other intellectual property, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe our issued patents or other intellectual property. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time consuming. Any claims we assert against perceived infringers could provoke these parties to assert counterclaims against us alleging that we infringe their patents, trademarks or other intellectual property. In addition, in a patent infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, construe the patent\u2019s claims narrowly or refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation proceeding could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly. In a trademark infringement proceeding, we could be enjoined from continued use of a trademark deemed to be infringing and forced to rebrand product packaging, product inserts, market and advertising materials, resulting in a loss of sales and established goodwill in that name or mark. In addition, we could be found liable for monetary damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees if we are found to have willfully infringed a trademark.\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. Even if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses and could distract our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nThird parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that we are infringing their intellectual property rights, the outcome of which would be uncertain and could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nOur commercial success depends upon our ability, and the ability of our partners, to develop, manufacture, market and sell our product candidates and use our proprietary technologies without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. There is considerable intellectual property litigation in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries. We may become party to, or threatened with, future adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our products and technology, including interference or derivation proceedings before the USPTO. The risks of being involved in such litigation and proceedings may increase as our product candidates near commercialization and as we gain the greater visibility associated with being a public company. Third parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing patents or patents that may be granted in the future. We may not be aware of all such intellectual property rights potentially relating to our product candidates and their uses. Thus, we do not know with certainty that any product candidate, or our commercialization thereof, does not and will not infringe or otherwise violate any third party\u2019s intellectual property.\nIf we are found to infringe a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, we could be required to obtain a license from such third party to continue developing and marketing our products and technology. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. We could be forced, including by court order, to cease commercializing the infringing technology or product. In addition, we could be found liable for monetary damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing our product candidates or force us to cease some of our business operations. Claims that we have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties could have a similar negative impact on our business.\nWe may be subject to claims by third parties asserting that our employees, consultants, independent contractors or we have misappropriated their intellectual property, or claiming ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property.\nMany of our employees and our licensors\u2019 employees, including our senior management, were previously employed at universities, medical institutions or other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Some of these employees, including members of our senior management, executed proprietary rights, non-disclosure and non-competition agreements, or similar agreements, in connection with such previous employment. Although we try to ensure that our employees do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that these employees or we have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such employee\u2019s former employer. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims.\nIn addition, while it is our policy to require our employees and contractors who may be involved in the development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who in fact develops intellectual property that we regard as our own. Our and their assignment agreements may not be self-executing or may be breached, and we may be forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims they may bring against us, to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property.\nIf we fail in prosecuting or defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in prosecuting or defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed.\nIn addition to seeking patents for some of our technology and product candidates, we also rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information, to maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect these trade secrets, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, such as our employees, corporate collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties. We also enter into confidentiality and invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and consultants. Despite these efforts, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them, or those to whom they communicate it, from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position would be harmed.\nIntellectual property rights do not necessarily address all potential threats to our competitive advantage.\nThe degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations, and may not adequately protect our business, or permit us to maintain our competitive advantage. The following examples are illustrative:\n\u2022others may be able to make product candidates that are the same as or similar to our product candidates but that are not covered by the claims of the patents that we own or have licensed;\n\u2022biosimilar product manufacturers may develop, seek approval for, and launch biosimilar versions of our products, which could be significantly less costly to bring to market and priced significantly lower than our products;\n\u2022we or our licensors might not have been the first inventor to file patent applications covering certain of our inventions;\n\u2022others may design around our intellectual property rights or independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies without infringing or misappropriating our intellectual property rights;\n\u2022it is possible that our pending patent applications will not lead to issued patents with claims that cover our products or even issued patents;\n\u2022issued patents that we own or have exclusively licensed may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or may be held invalid or unenforceable as a result of legal challenges;\n\u2022our competitors might conduct research and development activities in the United States and other countries that provide a safe harbor from patent infringement claims for certain research and development activities, as well as in countries where we do not have patent rights and then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in our major commercial markets;\n\u2022we may not develop additional proprietary technologies or product candidates that are patentable; and\n\u2022the intellectual property rights of others may have an adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Compliance\nIf and when we commercialize, our relationships with customers and third-party payors may be subject, directly or indirectly, to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, transparency, and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens and diminished profits and future earnings.\nHealthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors in the United States and elsewhere will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval. Our future arrangements with third-party payors and customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute any products for which we obtain marketing approval. In addition, we may be subject to transparency laws and patient privacy regulation by United States federal and state governments and by governments in non-US jurisdictions in which we conduct our business.\nFor a full discussion of these laws, see the subsection titled \u201cOther Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements\u201d in Item 1.\nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations may involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, including, without limitation, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, it may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from participation in government funded healthcare programs.\nCurrent and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for us to obtain marketing approval of our product candidates, including Vicineum for the treatment of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG, and affect the prices we may obtain.\nIn the United States and some non-US jurisdictions, there have been, and continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could, among other things, prevent or delay marketing approval of our product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability, or the ability of any commercialization partners, to profitably sell any products for which we, or they, obtain marketing approval. We expect that current laws, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we, or any commercialization partners, may receive for any approved products.\nCMS, the agency that administers the Medicare and Medicaid programs, may revise reimbursement and implement coverage restrictions. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our products.\nIn addition, in March 2010, President Obama signed into law the ACA. Among the provisions of the ACA of potential importance to our business and our product candidates are the following:\n\u2022an annual, non-deductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription products and biological products;\n\u2022an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the MDRP to 23.1% for innovator drugs and 13% for non-innovator drugs of the AMP;\n\u2022a new methodology by which AMP is calculated and reported by manufacturers for products that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected and not generally dispensed through retail community pharmacies;\n\u2022expansion of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the civil False Claims Act and the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers and enhanced penalties for noncompliance;\n\u2022a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 70% (as of January 1, 2019) point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand products to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturers\u2019 outpatient products to be covered under Medicare Part D;\n\u2022extension of manufacturers\u2019 Medicaid rebate liability from fee-for-service Medicaid utilization to include the utilization of Medicaid managed care organizations as well;\n\u2022expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers\u2019 Medicaid rebate liability;\n\u2022expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service Act's 340B drug pricing program;\n\u2022new requirements to report to CMS annually specifying financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals, as defined in the ACA and its implementing regulations, including reporting any \u2018\u2018payments or other transfers of value\u2019\u2019 made or distributed to prescribers, teaching hospitals, and other healthcare providers and reporting any ownership and investment interests held by physicians and other healthcare providers and their immediate family members and applicable group purchasing organizations during the preceding calendar year;\n\u2022a new requirement to annually report product samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians;\n\u2022a mandatory non-deductible payment for employers with 50 or more full-time employees (or equivalents) who fail to provide certain minimum health insurance coverage for such employees and their dependents;\n\u2022establishment of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation within CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models; and\n\u2022a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.\nCertain provisions of the ACA have been subject to judicial challenges, as well as efforts to repeal, replace, or otherwise modify them or to alter their interpretation or implementation. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted on December 22, 2017, eliminated the tax-based payment for individuals who fail to maintain minimum essential coverage under section 5000A of the Code, commonly referred to as the \u201cindividual mandate,\u201d effective January 1, 2019. Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 among other things, amended the Medicare statute, effective January 1, 2019, to reduce the coverage gap in most Medicare prescription drug plans, commonly known as the \u201cdonut hole,\u201d by raising the manufacturer discount under the Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program to 70%. Additional legislative changes, regulatory changes and judicial challenges related to the ACA remain possible. It is unclear how the ACA and its implementation, as well as efforts to repeal, replace, or otherwise modify, or invalidate, the ACA, or portions thereof, will affect our business.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011, as amended by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, led to aggregate reductions in Medicare payments for all items and services, including prescription drugs and biologics, to service providers of, on average, 2% per fiscal year beginning April 1, 2013, and due to subsequent legislation, will continue until 2030 (with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022). On December 10, 2021, President Biden signed a law that provides for 1% Medicare sequestration in the second quarter of 2022 and allows the full 2% sequestration thereafter until 2030. To offset the temporary suspension during the COVID-19 pandemic, in 2030, the sequestration will be 2.25% for the first half of the year, and 3% in the second half of the year.\nThe American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 also, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several categories of healthcare providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and otherwise affect the prices we may obtain for any of our product candidates for which regulatory approval is obtained, including Vicineum for the treatment of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial operations.\nAdditional legislative changes, regulatory changes, or guidance could be adopted, which may impact the marketing approvals and reimbursement for our product candidates. For example, there has been increasing legislative, regulatory, and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to drug pricing practices. There have been several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, evaluate the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government healthcare program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. For example, Congress is currently considering changes that could affect our overall rebate liability. Changes under consideration include a drug price negotiation program, Medicare Part B and Part D inflation rebates, under which manufacturers would owe rebates if the average sales price\nor average manufacturer price of a drug were to increase faster than the pace of inflation, and Part D benefit redesign, including a proposed new manufacturer discount program. If healthcare policies or reforms intended to curb healthcare costs are adopted or if we experience negative publicity with respect to pricing of our products or the pricing of pharmaceutical drugs generally, the prices that we charge for any approved products may be limited, our commercial opportunity may be limited and/or our revenues from sales of our products may be negatively impacted.\nIt is possible that the ACA, as currently enacted or may be amended in the future, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, more rigorous coverage criteria, and new payment methodologies and in additional downward pressure on coverage and payment and the price that we receive for any approved product. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our products. We cannot be sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted in the United States or outside of the United States, or whether regulatory changes, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals of our product candidates, if any, may be.\nOur failure to comply with data protection laws and regulations could lead to government enforcement actions and significant penalties against us, and adversely impact our operating results.\nThe regulatory environment surrounding information security, data collection, and privacy is increasingly demanding. In the United States, we are subject to a number of data protection laws and regulations (i.e., laws and regulations that address privacy and data security) at both the federal and state levels. The legislative and regulatory landscape for data protection continues to evolve, and in recent years there has been an increasing focus on privacy and data security issues. Numerous federal and state laws, including state data breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws, such as Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, govern the collection, use, and disclosure of health-related and other personal information.\nIn addition, we may obtain health information from third parties (e.g., healthcare providers who prescribe our products) that are subject to privacy and security requirements in the United States under HIPAA. Although we are not directly subject to HIPAA-other than potentially with respect to providing certain employee benefits-we could be subject to criminal penalties if we knowingly obtain, use or disclose individually identifiable health information maintained by a HIPAA-covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA. Finally, a data breach affecting sensitive personal information, including health information, could result in significant legal and financial exposure and reputational damages that could potentially have an adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition to US data protection laws and regulations, we also may be subject to European and other international data protection requirements, such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation. Our failure to comply with data privacy and security laws and regulations, or changes in the way in which these laws are implemented, could lead to unfavorable outcomes, including increased compliance costs, delays or impediments in the development of new products, increased operating costs, diversion of management time and attention, regulatory liability as a result of government enforcement actions and significant penalties against us, civil liability as a result of claims initiated by data subjects (including claims initiated as class actions) contracting parties or other third parties as a result of non-compliance with data protection laws and/or contractual obligations, and adverse publicity that could negatively affect our operating results, financial condition and our overall and business. Federal regulators, state attorneys general, and plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys, including class action attorneys, have been and will likely continue to be active in this space. Such liabilities could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and our overall business.\nLaws and regulations governing any international operations we may have in the future may preclude us from developing, manufacturing and selling certain products outside of the United States and require us to develop and implement costly compliance programs.\nFor our current and future operations outside of the United States, we must dedicate additional resources to comply with numerous laws and regulations in each jurisdiction in which we operate. The FCPA prohibits any United States individual or business from paying, offering, authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any non-US official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the non-US entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with certain accounting provisions requiring us to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.\nCompliance with the FCPA is expensive and difficult, particularly in countries in which corruption is a recognized problem. In addition, the FCPA presents particular challenges in the pharmaceutical industry, because, in many countries, hospitals are operated by the government, and doctors and other hospital employees are considered non-US officials. Certain payments to\nhospitals in connection with clinical trials and other work have been deemed to be improper payments to government officials and have led to FCPA enforcement actions.\nVarious laws, regulations and executive orders also restrict the use and dissemination outside of the United States, or the sharing with certain non-United States nationals, of information classified for national security purposes, as well as certain products and technical data relating to those products. If we expand our presence outside of the United States, it will require us to dedicate additional resources to comply with these laws, and these laws may preclude us from developing, manufacturing, or selling certain products and product candidates outside of the United States, which could limit our growth potential and increase our development costs.\nThe failure to comply with laws governing international business practices may result in substantial civil and criminal penalties and suspension or debarment from government contracting. The SEC also may suspend or bar issuers from trading securities on United States exchanges for violations of the FCPA\u2019s accounting provisions.\nOur employees may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including non-compliance with regulatory standards and requirements, which could cause significant liability for us and harm our reputation.\nWe are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct, including intentional failure to comply with FDA regulations or similar regulations of comparable non-United States regulatory authorities, failure to provide accurate information to the FDA or comparable non-United States regulatory authorities, including the competent authorities of the EU Member States, failure to comply with manufacturing standards we have established, failure to comply with federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations and similar laws and regulations established and enforced by comparable non-United States regulatory authorities, and failure to report financial information or data accurately or disclose unauthorized activities to us. Employee misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. It is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws, standards or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business and results of operations, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.\nRisks Related to our Business and Operations\nThe COVID-19 coronavirus could adversely impact our business.\nWe continue to monitor the effect of the novel strain of coronavirus, COVID-19. The COVID-19 coronavirus has spread and has caused significant disruptions around the world. We may experience disruptions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic that could severely impact our business, including:\n\u2022delays or difficulties related to the continued clinical development of Vicineum for non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG, including delays in clinical trial sites receiving the supplies and materials needed to conduct clinical trials, difficulties in recruiting clinical site investigators and clinical site staff and difficulties in enrolling patients or treating patients in active trials;\n\u2022difficulties in raising additional capital needed for the continued development of Vicineum for non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG and if approved, commercialization for Vicineum due to the long-term negative effects of the pandemic on the financial, banking and capital markets;\n\u2022delays in necessary interactions with regulators and other important agencies and contractors due to limitations in employee resources, travel restrictions or forced furlough of government employees;\n\u2022interruption of key business activities due to illness and/or quarantine of key individuals and delays associated with recruiting, hiring and training new temporary or permanent replacements for such key individuals, both internally and at our third-party service providers;\n\u2022evolving changes in local regulations as part of a response to the COVID-19 outbreak that may require us to change the ways in which operate, which may result in unexpected costs; and\n\u2022interruption of key commercialization, manufacturing, and related activities due to limitations on work and travel imposed or recommended by federal or state governments, employers and others.\nThe global pandemic of COVID-19 continues to evolve. The extent to which COVID-19 may impact our business will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, the duration of the outbreak, travel restrictions and social distancing in the United States and other countries, business closures or business disruptions and the effectiveness of actions taken in the United States and other countries to contain and treat the virus. The full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance, including our ability to execute our business strategies and\ninitiatives in the expected time frame, will depend on future developments, including the duration of the pandemic and continuing restrictions on travel and transports, and shelter-in-place, social distancing, and similar measures, all of which are uncertain and difficult to predict. The broad-based business and economic disruptions caused by the pandemic could materially affect our business condition, results of operations and cash flows, including our ability to raise additional capital.\nOur future success depends on our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.\nOur future growth and success depend on our ability to recruit, retain, manage and motivate our employees. The loss of any member of our senior management team or the inability to hire or retain experienced management personnel could compromise our ability to execute our business plan and harm our operating results. Recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, clinical, manufacturing and sales and marketing personnel will also be critical to our success. The loss of the services of our executive officers or other key employees could impede the achievement of our research, development and commercialization objectives and seriously harm our ability to successfully implement our business strategy. Furthermore, replacing executive officers and key employees may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in our industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to successfully develop, gain regulatory approval of and commercialize products. Competition to hire from this limited pool is intense, and we may be unable to hire, train, retain or motivate these key personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for similar personnel. We also experience competition for the hiring of scientific and clinical personnel from universities and research institutions. In addition, we rely on consultants and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, to assist us in formulating our research and development and commercialization strategy. Our consultants and advisors may be employed by employers other than us and may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit their availability to us. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain high quality personnel, our ability to pursue our growth strategy will be limited.\nWe rely significantly on information technology and any failure, inadequacy, interruption or security lapse of that technology, including any cyber security incidents, could materially adversely affect our business.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we rely on information technology networks and systems, some of which are provided, hosted or managed by third parties, to collect, store, process and transmit electronic data. In addition, we handle certain data, including proprietary business information and personal information that is subject to data protection laws and regulations. Despite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of third parties with which we contract are vulnerable to damage from cyber-attacks, computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. System failures, accidents or security breaches could cause interruptions in our operations and could result in a material disruption of our clinical and commercialization activities and business operations, in addition to possibly requiring substantial expenditures of resources to remedy. The loss of clinical trial data could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data.\nAlthough we have implemented processes, procedures, and controls to help mitigate the risks associated with a cyber security incident, there can be no assurance that these measures will be sufficient for all possible situations. Even security measures that are appropriate, reasonable, and/or in accordance with applicable legal requirements may not be able to protect the networks, systems and information we maintain and those of third parties with which we contract. Unauthorized parties, whether within or outside our company, may disrupt or gain access to our systems, or those of third parties with whom we do business, through human error, misfeasance, fraud, trickery, or other forms of deceit, including break-ins, use of stolen credentials, social engineering, phishing, ransomware, computer viruses or other malicious codes, and similar means of unauthorized and destructive tampering. Even the most well-protected information, networks, systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because the techniques used in such attempted cyber security incidents evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target. Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, making it impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk. While we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, threats and disruptions to our information technology infrastructure, none of them to date has had a material impact on our business or operations. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, our product research, development and, if approved, commercialization of Vicineum for the treatment of non-muscle invasive CIS of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate BCG could be delayed, or we could be subject to regulatory and other government investigations, enforcement actions, or incur liability, substantial fines or costs, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, our reputation, results of operations and financial condition. Although we maintain insurance coverage for various cyber security risks, there can be no guarantee that all costs or losses incurred will be fully insured.\nOur restructuring plan and the associated headcount reduction may not result in anticipated savings, could result in total costs and expenses that are greater than expected and could disrupt our business.\nOn August 30, 2021, we approved a restructuring plan to reduce operating expenses and better align our workforce with the needs of our business following receipt of the CRL from the FDA regarding our BLA for Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-\nunresponsive NMIBC. The restructuring plan included a reduction in our workforce by 18 positions (approximately 35%) as well as additional cost-saving initiatives intended to preserve capital while we continue development of Vicineum. Restructuring expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 were approximately $5.5 million, consisting primarily of severance and other employee-related costs of $2.8 million and contract termination costs of $2.7 million.\nWe may not realize, in full or in part, the anticipated benefits, savings and improvements in our cost structure from our restructuring efforts due to unforeseen difficulties, delays or unexpected costs. If we are unable to realize the expected operational efficiencies and cost savings from the restructuring, our operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected. Furthermore, our restructuring plan may be disruptive to our operations. For example, our headcount reductions could yield unanticipated consequences, such as increased difficulties in implementing our business strategy, including retention of our remaining employees.\nWe and certain of our officers have been named as defendants in three pending securities class action lawsuits and three related shareholder derivative lawsuits have been filed. These lawsuits, and potential similar or related lawsuits, could result in substantial damages, divert management\u2019s time and attention from our business, and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. These lawsuits, and any other lawsuits to which we are subject, will be costly to defend and are uncertain in their outcome.\nOn August 19, 2021, August 31, 2021 and October 7,2021, three substantially identical securities class action lawsuits captioned Bibb v. Sesen Bio, Inc., et. al., Case No. 1:21-cv-07025, Cizek v. Sesen Bio, Inc., et. al., Case No. 1:21-cv-07309 and Markman v. Sesen Bio, Inc. et al., Case No. 1:21-cv-08308 were filed against us and certain of our officers in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York. The three complaints allege violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder based on statements made by us concerning our BLA for Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC. The three complaints seek compensatory damages and costs and expenses, including attorneys\u2019 fees. On October 29, 2021, the court consolidated the three cases under the caption In re Sesen Bio, Inc. Securities Litigation, Master File No. 1:21-cv-07025-AKH (the \u201cSecurities Litigation\u201d), and appointed Ryan Bibb, Rodney Samaan, Lionel Dreshaj and Benjamin Dreshaj (\u201cLead Plaintiffs\u201d) collectively as the lead plaintiffs under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. On November 1, 2021, two stockholders filed motions to reconsider asking the court to appoint a different lead plaintiff. The court has not ruled on those motions at this time. On November 24, 2021, defendants filed a motion to transfer venue to the US District Court for the District of Massachusetts. That motion was fully briefed as of December 13, 2021, but the court has not yet ruled on that motion. On December 6, 2021, the Lead Plaintiffs filed an amended class action complaint (the \u201cAmended Complaint\u201d). The Amended Complaint alleges the same violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder on the same theory as the prior complaints. Defendants\u2019 response to the Amended Complaint is due to be filed on March 7, 2022.\nOn September 20, 2021 and September 24, 2021, two substantially similar derivative lawsuits captioned Myers v. Sesen Bio, Inc., et. al., Case No. 1:21-cv-11538 and D\u2019Arcy v. Sesen Bio, Inc., et. al., Case No. 1:21-cv-11577 were filed against our board of directors and certain of our officers in the US District Court for the District of Massachusetts, with Sesen Bio, Inc. named as a nominal defendant. On January 12, 2022, a third derivative complaint captioned Tang v. Sesen Bio, Inc., et al., was filed in Superior Court in Massachusetts against our board of directors and certain of our officers in the US District Court for the District of Massachusetts, with us named as nominal defendant, but no defendant has yet been served. The three derivative complaints allege breach of fiduciary duties, waste of corporate assets, and violations of federal securities laws based on statements made by us concerning our BLA for Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC. The D\u2019Arcy complaint further alleges unjust enrichment, abuse of control, gross mismanagement and aiding and abetting thereof. The three derivative complaints seek unspecified damages, restitution and disgorgement of profits, benefits and compensation obtained by the defendants and costs and expenses, including attorneys\u2019 fees. On October 18, 2021, the court consolidated the two federal court cases under the caption In re Sesen Bio, Inc. Derivative Litigation, Lead Case No. 1:21-cv-11538 (the \u201cFederal Derivative Litigation\u201d). On December 22, 2021, the court entered a joint stipulation among the parties to stay the Federal Derivative Litigation until after a ruling on any motion to dismiss filed by defendants in the Securities Litigation. Defendants intend to seek a similar stay of the state court derivative litigation in the event any defendant is served.\nWe believe that these lawsuits are without merit and intend to vigorously defend against these actions. However, whether or not the claims are successful, litigation is often expensive and can divert management\u2019s attention and resources from other business concerns, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe currently are not able to estimate the possible cost to us from these actions, as the pending lawsuits are currently at an early stage, and we cannot be certain how long it may take to resolve the pending lawsuits or the possible amount of any damages that we may be required to pay. If we are ultimately required to pay significant defense costs, damages or settlement amounts, such payments could adversely affect our operations.\nWe may be the target of similar litigation in the future. The market price of our common stock has experienced and may continue to experience volatility, and in the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock\nhave been subject to securities litigation. Any future litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business. We maintain liability insurance; however, if any costs or expenses associated with the pending lawsuits or any other litigation exceed our insurance coverage, we may be forced to bear some or all costs and expenses directly, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or stock price.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nIf we are unable to regain compliance with the listing requirements of the Nasdaq Global Market, our common stock may be delisted from the Nasdaq Global Market which could have a material adverse effect on our business and could make it more difficult for you to sell your shares.\nOur common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Market, and we are therefore subject to its continued listing requirements, including requirements with respect to the market value of publicly-held shares, market value of listed shares, minimum bid price per share, and minimum stockholders' equity, among others, and requirements relating to board and committee independence. If we fail to satisfy one or more of the requirements, we may be delisted from the Nasdaq Global Market.\nOn January 24, 2022, we received notice (the \"Notice\") from the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (\"Nasdaq\") that we are not currently in compliance with the $1.00 minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Global Market, as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(a)(1). The Notice indicated that, consistent with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we have 180 calendar days, or until July 25, 2022, to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement by having the closing bid price of our common stock meet or exceed $1.00 per share for at least ten consecutive business days. The notification had no immediate effect on the listing of our common stock, and our common stock will continue to trade on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol \u201cSESN\u201d at this time.\nIf we do not regain compliance by July 25, 2022, we may be eligible for an additional 180 calendar day grace period. If we fail to regain compliance during the applicable period, we will receive notification from Nasdaq that our common stock is subject to delisting. At that time, we may then appeal the delisting determination to a Nasdaq hearings panel. Such notification will have no immediate effect on our listing on the Nasdaq Global Market, nor will it have an immediate effect on the trading of our common stock pending such hearing. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to regain compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s minimum bid price requirement. If we regain compliance with the Nasdaq\u2019s minimum bid price requirement, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain compliance with the continued listing requirements for the Nasdaq Global Market or that our common stock will not be delisted from the Nasdaq Global Market in the future. In addition, we may be unable to meet other applicable listing requirements of the Nasdaq Global Market, including maintaining minimum levels of stockholders\u2019 equity or market values of our common stock in which case, our common stock could be delisted notwithstanding our ability to demonstrate compliance with the minimum bid price requirement.\nDelisting from the Nasdaq Global Market may adversely affect our ability to raise additional financing through the public or private sale of equity securities, may significantly affect the ability of investors to trade our securities and may negatively affect the value and liquidity of our common stock. Delisting also could have other negative results, including the potential loss of employee confidence, the loss of institutional investors or interest in business development opportunities.\nIf we are delisted from Nasdaq and we are not able to list our common stock on another exchange, our common stock could be quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board or in the \u201cpink sheets.\u201d As a result, we could face significant adverse consequences including, among others:\n\u2022a limited availability of market quotations for our securities;\n\u2022a determination that our common stock is a \u201cpenny stock\u201d which will require brokers trading in our common stock to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities;\n\u2022a limited amount of news and little or no analyst coverage for us;\n\u2022we would no longer qualify for exemptions from state securities registration requirements, which may require us to comply with applicable state securities laws; and\n\u2022a decreased ability to issue additional securities (including pursuant to short-form Registration Statements on Form S-3) or obtain additional financing in the future.\nIf our common stock becomes subject to the penny stock rules, it would become more difficult to trade our shares.\nThe SEC has adopted rules that regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. Penny stocks are generally equity securities with a price of less than $5.00, other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or authorized for quotation on certain automated quotation systems, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or system. If we do not retain our listing on Nasdaq and if the price of our common stock is less than $5.00, our common stock may be deemed a penny stock. The\npenny stock rules require a broker-dealer, before a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document containing specified information. In addition, the penny stock rules require that before effecting any transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, a broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive (i) the purchaser\u2019s written acknowledgment of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement; (ii) a written agreement to transactions involving penny stocks; and (iii) a signed and dated copy of a written suitability statement. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the trading activity in the secondary market for our common stock, and therefore stockholders may have difficulty selling their shares.\nProvisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of our company, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the \"Certificate of Incorporation\") and our bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control of our company that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. In addition, because our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors. Among other things, these provisions:\n\u2022establish a classified board of directors such that only one of three classes of directors is elected each year;\n\u2022allow the authorized number of our directors to be changed only by resolution of our board of directors;\n\u2022limit the manner in which stockholders can remove directors from our board of directors;\n\u2022establish advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals that can be acted on at stockholder meetings and nominations to our board of directors;\n\u2022require that stockholder actions must be affected at a duly called stockholder meeting and prohibit actions by our stockholders by written consent;\n\u2022limit who may call stockholder meetings;\n\u2022authorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could be used to institute a \u201cpoison pill\u201d that would work to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, effectively preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our board of directors; and\n\u2022require the approval of the holders of at least 75% of the votes that all our stockholders would be entitled to cast to amend or repeal specified provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation or bylaws.\nMoreover, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits a person who owns in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner.", "PERMNO": 14452, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "SESN"}
