{"cik": "1725526", "company": "HighPoint Resources Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-24", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nOur business involves a high degree of risk. If any of the following risks, or any risk described elsewhere in this Form 10-K, actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer. The risks described below are not the only risks facing the Company. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial also may adversely affect our Company.\nRisks Related to the Merger and the Prepackaged Plan\nThe Merger may not be completed and, if it is completed, will subject our stockholders to certain risks and uncertainties. We are also subject to numerous risks associated with the Prepackaged Plan.\nKey risks associated with the Merger and the Prepackaged Plan are described below, and are discussed in the \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section of Bonanza Creek\u2019s Registration Statement on Form S-4 filed with the SEC in connection with the Merger:\n\u2022Because the market price of Bonanza Creek common stock will fluctuate, HighPoint stockholders and holders of HighPoint equity awards cannot be sure of the value of the shares of Bonanza Creek common stock they will receive, in the aggregate, in the Merger. In addition, because the number of shares of Bonanza Creek common stock to be issued in the Merger is fixed, the number of shares of Bonanza Creek common stock to be received, in the aggregate, by HighPoint stockholders and holders of HighPoint equity awards in the Merger will not change between now and the time the Merger is completed to reflect changes in the trading prices of Bonanza Creek common stock or HighPoint common stock.\n\u2022HighPoint stockholders, as of immediately prior to the Merger, will have reduced ownership in the combined company.\n\u2022Bonanza Creek and HighPoint must obtain certain regulatory approvals and clearances to consummate the Merger, which, if delayed, not granted or granted with unacceptable conditions, could prevent, substantially delay or impair consummation of the Merger, result in additional expenditures of money and resources or reduce the anticipated benefits of the Merger.\n\u2022The Merger is subject to a number of conditions to the obligations of both Bonanza Creek and HighPoint to complete the Merger, which, if not fulfilled, or not fulfilled in a timely manner, may delay completion of the Merger or result in termination of the Merger Agreement.\n\u2022The Merger Agreement subjects HighPoint to restrictions on its business activities prior to the effective time of the Merger.\n\u2022The Merger Agreement limits HighPoint\u2019s ability to pursue alternatives to the Merger, may discourage other companies from making a favorable alternative transaction proposal and, in specified circumstances, could require HighPoint to pay a termination fee to Bonanza Creek.\n\u2022Failure to complete the Merger out of court or in connection with the Prepackaged Plan could negatively impact HighPoint\u2019s stock price and have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, cash flows and financial position.\n\u2022The transaction support agreement relating to the Merger may be terminated.\n\u2022Litigation relating to the merger could result in an injunction preventing the completion of the Merger and/or substantial costs to HighPoint or the combined company.\n\u2022The Prepackaged Plan may have a material adverse effect on HighPoint\u2019s operations.\n\u2022Even if HighPoint receives all necessary acceptances and meets all other conditions precedent for the Prepackaged Plan to become effective, the HighPoint board may, for fiduciary or other reasons on behalf of HighPoint, choose not to commence the HighPoint Chapter 11 cases and the transactions, including the Merger, may not be completed.\n\u2022The Bankruptcy Court may not confirm the Prepackaged Plan or may require HighPoint to re-solicit votes with respect to the Prepackaged Plan.\n\u2022The Prepackaged Plan may be confirmed over the objection of the HighPoint stockholders.\n\u2022Even if HighPoint receives all acceptances necessary for the Prepackaged Plan to become effective, HighPoint may fail to meet all conditions precedent to effectiveness of the Prepackaged Plan.\n\u2022Other parties in interest might be permitted to propose alternative plans of reorganization that may be less favorable to certain of HighPoint\u2019s constituencies than the Prepackaged Plan.\n\u2022HighPoint cannot predict the amount of time that it would spend in bankruptcy for the purpose of implementing the Prepackaged Plan and a lengthy bankruptcy proceeding could disrupt HighPoint\u2019s business as well as impair the prospect for reorganization on the terms contained in the Prepackaged Plan.\n\u2022HighPoint may seek to amend, waive, modify or withdraw the Prepackaged Plan at any time prior to the confirmation of the Prepackaged Plan.\nRisks Related to our Senior Notes and Credit Facility\nOur potential inability to comply with the financial covenants in our Credit Facility have raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We may not be able to generate enough cash flow to meet our debt obligations.\nWe have financial covenants associated with our Credit Facility that are measured each quarter. As discussed in the \u201cGoing Concern\u201d section in Note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements, based on our forecasted cash flow analysis for the twelve month period subsequent to the date of this filing, it is probable we will breach a financial covenant under our Credit Facility in the third quarter of 2021. However, timing could change as a result of changes in our business and the overall economic environment. Violation of any covenant under the Credit Facility provides the lenders with the option to accelerate the maturity of the Credit Facility, which carries a balance of $140.0 million as of December 31, 2020. This would, in turn, result in cross-default under the indentures to our senior notes, accelerating the maturity of the senior notes, which have a principal balance outstanding of $625.0 million as of December 31, 2020. We do not have sufficient cash on hand or available liquidity that can be utilized to repay the outstanding debt in the event of default. These conditions and events raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nIn addition, our independent auditor has included an explanatory paragraph regarding our ability to continue as a \u201cgoing concern\u201d (\u201cgoing concern opinion\u201d) in its report in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which would accelerate a default under our Credit Facility to the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. However, we obtained a waiver from our lenders removing the default associated with this going concern opinion.\nIn response to these conditions, we have taken various steps to preserve our liquidity including (1) deferring drilling and completion activity starting in May 2020 for the foreseeable future, (2) continuing to focus on reducing our operating and overhead costs, and (3) continuing to manage our hedge portfolio. We could remain in compliance with the financial covenant if we (1) negotiate a waiver of the financial covenant with the lenders, (2) negotiate more flexible financial covenants, or (3) refinance the Credit Facility or senior notes. However, the availability of capital funding that would allow us to refinance the debt on acceptable terms has substantially diminished. In addition, we entered into a Merger Agreement with Bonanza Creek on November 9, 2020, pursuant to which HighPoint\u2019s debt will be restructured and HighPoint will merge with a wholly owned subsidiary of Bonanza Creek, with HighPoint continuing its existence as the surviving company following the merger and continuing as a wholly owned subsidiary of Bonanza Creek. See \u201cItems 1 and 2 Business and Properties - Business - Significant Business Developments\u201d for additional information. However, the Merger has not yet closed and the closing is subject to numerous conditions. See \u201cRisks Related to the Merger\u201d above and \u201cItems 1 and 2 Business and Properties - Business - Significant Business Developments\u201d for additional information.\nAt December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $24.7 million and $140.0 million outstanding under the Credit Facility. At December 31, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of $16.4 million and $140.0 million outstanding under our Credit Facility. As part of our regular semi-annual redeterminations, the elected commitment amount on our Credit Facility was reduced to $300.0 million on May 21, 2020 and to $185.0 million on November 3, 2020. Our available borrowing capacity as of December 31, 2020 was $24.0 million, after taking into account $21.0 million of outstanding irrevocable letters of credit, which were issued as credit support for future payments under contractual obligations.\nIf we do not generate enough cash flow from operations to satisfy our debt obligations, and the Merger does not close, we may have to undertake one or more alternative financing plans, such as:\n\u2022refinancing or restructuring our debt;\n\u2022filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy;\n\u2022selling assets;\n\u2022reducing or delaying capital investments; or\n\u2022seeking to raise additional capital.\nHowever, any alternative financing plans that we undertake may not be completed in a timely manner or at all, and even if completed may not allow us to meet our debt obligations. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations, including our obligations under the senior notes, or to obtain alternative financing, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur debt could have important consequences. For example, it could:\n\u2022increase our costs of doing business;\n\u2022increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022limit our ability to fund future capital expenditures and working capital, to engage in future acquisitions or development activities, or to otherwise realize the value of our assets and opportunities fully because of the need to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments of interest and principal on our debt or to comply with any restrictive terms of our debt;\n\u2022limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future; and\n\u2022place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt.\nOur customers, suppliers, vendors, employees and other third parties with whom we do business may react negatively to the substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nIt may be more difficult to enter into contractual arrangements with our customers who purchase our oil and gas production as well as with other oil and gas companies, including those that supply equipment and other resources that we will use in our business. We may not be able to establish strategic relationships, which may take the form of joint ventures with other third\nparties. If our strategic relationships are not established or maintained, our business prospects may be limited, which could diminish our ability to conduct our operations.\nRisks Related to the Oil and Natural Gas Industry and Our Business\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and recent developments in the oil and gas industry have and could continue to materially adversely affect our operations during 2021 and possibly beyond.\nIn early 2020, global health care systems and economies began to experience strain from the spread of COVID-19, a highly transmissible and pathogenic coronavirus (the \u201cCOVID-19 pandemic\u201d). As the virus spread, global economic activity began to slow, resulting in a decrease in demand for oil and natural gas. In response, OPEC+ initiated discussions to reduce production to support energy prices. With OPEC+ unable to agree on cuts, energy prices declined sharply during the first half of 2020. While prices partially recovered during the second half of 2020, uncertainties related to the demand for oil and natural gas remain as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact the world economy. The impacts of substantially lower oil, natural gas and NGL prices on our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 were mostly mitigated by hedges in place on 91% of our oil production and 33% of our natural gas production. However, the economics of our existing wells and planned future development were adversely affected, which led to impairments of our proved and unproved oil and gas properties, reductions to our oil and gas reserve quantities and reductions to the borrowing capacity on our Credit Facility. There is uncertainty around the timing of recovery of the global economy from COVID-19 and its effects on the supply and demand for oil, natural gas and NGLs. If energy prices do not improve, our capital availability, liquidity and profitability will continue to be adversely affected, particularly after our current hedges are realized in 2021.\nA U.S. and global economic downturn due to the COVID-19 pandemic or other global crisis could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nAny or all of the following may occur as a result of an economic downturn:\n\u2022The economic slowdown could lead to continued lower demand for oil and natural gas by individuals and industries, which in turn could result in continued lower prices for the oil and natural gas sold by us, lower revenues and possibly losses.\n\u2022The lenders under our Credit Facility may become more restrictive in their lending practices or unable or unwilling to fund their commitments, which would limit our access to capital to fund our capital expenditures and operations. This would limit our ability to generate revenues as well as limit our projected production and reserves growth, leading to declining production and possibly losses.\n\u2022We may be unable to obtain additional debt or equity financing, which would require us to continue to limit our capital expenditures and other spending. This would lead to lower production levels and reserves than if we were able to spend more than our cash flow. Financing costs may significantly increase as lenders may be reluctant to lend without receiving higher fees and spreads.\n\u2022The losses incurred by financial institutions and the insolvency of some financial institutions heightens the risk that a counterparty to our hedge arrangements could default on its obligations. These losses and the possibility of a counterparty declaring bankruptcy or being placed in conservatorship or receivership may affect the ability of the counterparties to meet their obligations to us on hedge transactions, which could reduce our revenues from hedges at a time when we are also receiving a lower price for our natural gas and oil sales. As a result, our financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\n\u2022Our Credit Facility bears floating interest rates based on the London Interbank Offer Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d). LIBOR will no longer be used as a reference index for determining interest rates under credit arrangements starting in 2023. The elimination of LIBOR may cause us to incur increased interest expense.\n\u2022Our Credit Facility requires the lenders to redetermine our borrowing base semi-annually. Our borrowing capacity was reduced from $500 million to $250 million in May 2020 and from $250 million to $185 million in November 2020. The redeterminations are based on our proved reserves and hedge position based on price assumptions that our lenders require us to use to calculate reserves pursuant to the Credit Facility. The lenders could reduce their price assumptions used to determine reserves for calculating our borrowing base due to lower commodities and futures prices and our borrowing base could be reduced further. This would further reduce our funds available to borrow. In addition, the\nlenders can request an interim redetermination during each six month period which could reduce the funds available to borrow under our Credit Facility.\n\u2022Bankruptcies of financial institutions or illiquidity of money market funds may limit or delay our access to our cash and cash equivalent deposits, causing us to lose some or all of those funds or to incur additional costs to borrow funds needed on a short-term basis that were previously funded from our money market deposits.\n\u2022Bankruptcies of purchasers of our oil and natural gas could lead to the delay or failure of us to receive the revenues from those sales.\nOil and gas prices are volatile and changes in prices can significantly affect our financial results and estimated proved oil and gas reserves.\nOur revenue, profitability and cash flow depend upon the prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs. The markets for these commodities are very volatile, based on supply and demand, and even relatively modest drops in prices can significantly affect our financial results and impede our growth. Changes in oil, natural gas and NGL prices have a significant impact on the value of our reserves and on our cash flow. Prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs may fluctuate widely in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and gas, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control, such as:\n\u2022the global demand for oil, natural gas and NGLs;\n\u2022domestic and foreign governmental regulations;\n\u2022variations between product prices at sales points and applicable index prices;\n\u2022political and economic conditions in oil producing countries, including the Middle East and South America;\n\u2022the ability and willingness of members of OPEC+ to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls;\n\u2022weather conditions;\n\u2022technological advances affecting energy consumption;\n\u2022national and global economic conditions;\n\u2022proximity and capacity of oil and gas pipelines, refineries and other transportation and processing facilities;\n\u2022the price and availability of alternative fuels; and\n\u2022the strength of the U.S. dollar compared to other currencies.\nLower oil, natural gas and NGL prices may not only decrease our revenues on a per unit basis, but also may reduce the amount of oil, natural gas and NGLs that we can produce economically and therefore the quantity and the estimated present value of our reserves. If this occurs or if our estimates of development costs increase, production data factors change or our exploration or development results deteriorate, successful efforts accounting rules may require us to write down or impair, as a non-cash charge to earnings, the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties. We are required to perform impairment tests on our assets whenever events or changes in circumstances lead to a reduction of the estimated useful life or estimated future cash flows that would indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable or whenever management\u2019s plans change with respect to those assets.\nAs described above, oil, natural gas and NGL prices declined significantly during 2020 due to OPEC+ unable to agree on cuts and the COVID-19 pandemic. These decreases have increased the volatility and amplitude of the other risks facing us as described in this report and have impacted our business and financial condition.\nIf commodity prices decrease to a level such that our future undiscounted cash flows from our properties are less than their carrying value for a significant period of time or cause us to change drilling plans and/or forego lease renewals or cause significant decreases in property market values, we may be required to take an impairment against the carrying values of our proved and/or unproved properties.\nAccounting rules require that we periodically review the carrying value of our properties for possible impairment. Based on specific market factors and circumstances at the time of prospective impairment reviews, and the continuing evaluation of development plans, production data, economics and other factors such as lease expirations, changes in drilling plans and adverse drilling results, we may be required to take an impairment against the carrying value of our properties. An impairment constitutes a non-cash charge to earnings. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded non-cash impairment charges of approximately $1.3 billion on proved and unproved oil and gas properties, and if market or other economic conditions deteriorate further or if oil and gas prices continue to decline, we may incur additional impairment charges, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur drilling efforts and our well operations may not be profitable or achieve our targeted returns.\nDrilling for oil, natural gas and NGLs may result in unprofitable efforts from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient commercial quantities to cover drilling, operating and other costs. In addition, even a commercial well may have production that is less, or costs that are greater, than we projected. The cost of drilling, completing and operating a well is often uncertain, and many factors can adversely affect the economics of a well or property. Drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of unexpected drilling conditions, equipment failures or accidents, shortages of equipment or personnel, environmental issues, midstream constraints and for other reasons. We rely to a significant extent on seismic data and other advanced technologies in identifying unproved property prospects. The seismic data and other technologies we use do not allow us to know conclusively, prior to acquisition of unproved property or drilling a well, whether oil, natural gas or NGLs are present or may be produced economically. The use of seismic data and other technologies also requires greater pre-drilling expenditures than traditional drilling strategies. Drilling results in some of our plays may be more uncertain than in other plays that are more mature and have longer established drilling and production histories, and we can provide no assurance that drilling and completion techniques that have proven to be successful in other formations to maximize recoveries will be ultimately successful when used in our prospects. As a result, we may incur future dry hole costs and/or impairment charges due to any of these factors.\nWe have acquired significant amounts of proved and unproved property in order to attempt to further our exploration and development efforts. Drilling and production activities are subject to many risks, including the risk that no commercially productive reservoirs will be discovered. We acquire proved and unproved properties and lease undeveloped acreage that we believe will enhance our growth potential and increase our earnings over time. We cannot guarantee that all prospects will be economically viable or that we will not abandon our initial investments. Additionally, there can be no assurance that proved or unproved property acquired by us or undeveloped acreage leased by us will be profitably developed, that new wells drilled by us in prospects that we pursue will be productive, that we will recover all or any portion of our investment in such proved or unproved property or wells, or that we will succeed in bringing on additional partners.\nSubstantially all of our producing properties are located in the DJ Basin, making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in one major geographic area.\nOur operations are focused on the DJ Basin, which means our current producing properties and new drilling opportunities are geographically concentrated in that area. Because our operations are not as diversified geographically as many of our competitors, the success of our operations and our profitability may be disproportionately exposed to the effect of any regional events, including fluctuations in prices of oil, natural gas and NGLs produced from the wells in the region, natural disasters, restrictive governmental regulations, transportation capacity constraints, weather, curtailment of production or interruption of transportation and processing, and any resulting delays or interruptions of production from existing or planned new wells.\nWe are subject to complex federal, state, local and other laws and regulations that could adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of doing business and the recording of proved reserves. Changes in the regulatory environment could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur exploration, development, production and marketing operations are subject to extensive environmental regulation at the federal, state and local levels including those governing emissions to air, wastewater discharges, hazardous and solid wastes, remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater, protection of surface and groundwater, land reclamation and preservation of natural resources. Under these laws and regulations, we could be held liable for personal injuries, property damage (including site clean-up and restoration costs) and other damages. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may also result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative, civil, and criminal penalties, including the assessment of natural resource damages. Environmental and other governmental laws and regulations also increase the costs to plan, permit, design, drill, install, operate and abandon oil and natural gas wells and related facilities. Moreover, public interest in environmental protection has increased in recent years, and environmental organizations have opposed, with some success, certain drilling projects, leading to delays. One of the first actions of the new Biden Administration was to suspend the processing of federal permits, followed by a 90-day hiatus of the federal leasing program.\nThe regulatory environment in which we operate is subject to frequent changes, often in ways that increase our costs and make it more difficult for us to obtain necessary permits in a timely manner. See \u201cBusiness and Properties-Operations-Environmental Matters and Regulation\u201d for a summary of certain environmental regulations that affect our business and related developments, including potential future regulatory developments.\nOur success depends on key members of our management and our ability to attract and retain experienced technical and other professional personnel.\nOur future success depends to a large extent on the services of our key employees. The loss of one or more of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business. If we cannot retain our current personnel or attract additional experienced personnel, our ability to compete could be adversely affected. Also, the loss of experienced personnel could lead to a loss of technical expertise.\nMarket conditions or operational impediments may hinder our access to oil and natural gas markets or delay our production.\nMarket conditions or the unavailability of satisfactory oil and natural gas transportation arrangements may hinder our access to oil and natural gas markets or delay our production. The availability of a ready market for our oil, natural gas and NGL production depends on a number of factors, including the demand for and supply of oil and natural gas and the proximity of our reserves to pipelines and terminal facilities. Our ability to market our production depends in substantial part on the availability and capacity of gathering systems, pipelines, processing facilities and refineries owned and operated by third parties. We may be required to shut in wells for a lack of a market or because of inadequacy or unavailability of natural gas pipeline, gathering system capacity or processing facilities. If that were to occur, we would be unable to realize revenue from those wells until production arrangements were made to deliver the production to market.\nWe may incur substantial losses and be subject to substantial liability claims as a result of our oil and gas operations. In addition, we may not be insured for, or our insurance may be inadequate to protect us against, these risks.\nWe are not insured against all risks. Losses and liabilities arising from uninsured or under-insured events could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our oil and natural gas exploration and production activities, including well stimulation and completion activities such as hydraulic fracturing, are subject to all of the operating risks associated with drilling for and producing oil and natural gas, including the possibility of:\n\u2022environmental hazards, such as uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas, brine, well fluids, toxic gas or other pollution into the environment, including groundwater contamination;\n\u2022abnormally pressured or structured formations;\n\u2022mechanical difficulties, such as stuck oilfield drilling and service tools and casing collapse;\n\u2022fires, explosions and ruptures of pipelines;\n\u2022personal injuries and death; and\n\u2022natural disasters or other adverse weather conditions.\nAny of these risks could adversely affect our ability to conduct operations or result in substantial losses to us as a result of:\n\u2022injury or loss of life;\n\u2022damage to and destruction of property and equipment;\n\u2022damage to natural resources due to underground migration of hydraulic fracturing fluids or other fluids or gases;\n\u2022pollution and other environmental damage, including spillage or mishandling of recovered hydrocarbons, hydraulic fracturing fluids and produced water;\n\u2022regulatory investigations and penalties;\n\u2022suspension of our operations; and\n\u2022repair and remediation costs.\nWe have elected, and may in the future elect, not to obtain insurance if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. For example, we do not carry business interruption insurance for these reasons. In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. Further, we could be unaware of a pollution event when it occurs and therefore be unable to report the event within the time period required under the relevant policy. The occurrence of an event that is not covered or not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our production, revenues and results of operations and overall financial condition.\nOur operations require substantial capital and we may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms or at all, which could lead to a loss of properties and a decline in our oil, natural gas and NGL reserves.\nThe oil and gas industry is capital intensive. We make and expect to continue to make substantial capital expenditures in our business and operations for the development, production and acquisition of oil, natural gas and NGL reserves. To date, we\nhave financed capital expenditures primarily with cash generated by operations, sales of our equity and debt securities, proceeds from bank borrowings and sales of properties. Our cash flow from operations and access to capital is subject to a number of variables, including:\n\u2022our proved reserves;\n\u2022the level of oil, natural gas and NGLs we are able to produce from existing wells;\n\u2022the prices at which oil, natural gas and NGLs are sold;\n\u2022the costs required to operate production;\n\u2022our ability to acquire, locate and produce new reserves;\n\u2022global credit and securities markets;\n\u2022the ability and willingness of lenders and investors to provide capital and the cost of that capital; and\n\u2022the interest of buyers in our properties and the price they are willing to pay for properties.\nIf our revenues or the borrowing base under our Credit Facility decrease as a result of lower oil, natural gas and NGLs prices, which was the case for both semi-annual borrowing base redeterminations in 2020, operating difficulties, declines in reserves or for any other reason, we may have limited ability to obtain the capital necessary to sustain our operations at current or planned levels. We may, from time to time, need to seek additional financing. Our Credit Facility and senior note indentures place certain restrictions on our ability to obtain new financing. There can be no assurance as to the availability or terms of any additional financing. Recent commodity price decreases have made it substantially more difficult for us and other industry participants to raise capital, and will likely continue to have an adverse effect on our borrowing base.\nOur future drilling plans were suspended in 2020 and continue to be suspended due to significant declines in commodity prices and a decrease in borrowing capacity on our Credit Facility. In addition, in November 2020 we entered into the Merger Agreement with Bonanza Creek, and that agreement restricts our near-term capital spending levels and does not allow for drilling or completion operations. Furthermore, if the Merger does not close as contemplated, we do not have assurance that we will have the capital availability to resume drilling and completion operations. This resulted in a reduction in our oil, natural gas and NGL reserves as of December 31, 2020 primarily due to removing all PUD reserves, as we are not reasonably certain the PUD reserves will be drilled within the five year development window at the time the applicable PUD reserve is booked. Continued delays in our development plans could lead to a possible loss of properties and additional declines in our oil, natural gas and NGLs reserves as well as our revenues and results of operations.\nOur identified drilling location inventories are scheduled out over several years, making them susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling.\nOur management has specifically identified and scheduled drilling locations as an estimation of our future multi-year drilling activities on our existing acreage. These identified drilling locations represent a significant part of our strategy. Our ability to drill and develop these locations depends on a number of uncertainties, including the availability of capital, seasonal conditions, regulatory approvals, oil, natural gas and NGLs prices, costs and drilling results. Because of these uncertainties, we do not know if the numerous potential drilling locations we have identified will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce oil, natural gas and NGLs from these or any other potential drilling locations. As such, our actual drilling activities may differ materially from those presently identified, which could adversely affect our business.\nCompetition in the oil and gas industry is intense, which may adversely affect our ability to succeed.\nThe oil and gas industry is intensely competitive, and we compete with other companies that have greater resources. Many of these companies not only explore for, develop and produce oil, natural gas and NGLs, but also carry on midstream and refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a regional, national or worldwide basis. These companies are able to pay more for producing oil, natural gas and NGLs properties and exploration and development prospects or define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit. In addition, these companies have a greater ability to continue exploration activities during periods of low oil, natural gas and NGLs market prices. Our larger or integrated competitors are better able than we are to absorb the burden of existing and any changes to federal, state, local and Native American tribal laws and regulations, which could adversely affect our competitive position. Our ability to acquire additional properties and to discover reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. In addition, because we have fewer financial resources than many companies in our industry, we may be at a disadvantage in bidding for producing properties and exploration and development prospects.\nThe willingness and ability of our lenders to fund their lending obligations under our Credit Facility may be limited, which would affect our ability to fund our operations.\nOur Credit Facility has commitments from 11 lenders. If credit markets become more turbulent as a result of the current economic downturn, increased regulatory oversight, lower commodity prices or other factors, our lenders may become more restrictive in their lending practices or may be unwilling or unable to fund their commitments, which would limit our access to capital to fund our capital expenditures, operations or meet other obligations. This would limit our ability to generate revenues as well as limit our projected production and reserves growth, leading to declining production and potentially losses.\nOur estimated reserves are based on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in these assumptions will materially affect the quantities of our reserves.\nUnderground accumulations of oil, natural gas and NGLs cannot be measured in an exact way. Oil, natural gas and NGLs reserve engineering requires estimates of underground accumulations of oil, natural gas and NGLs and assumptions concerning future oil, natural gas and NGLs prices, production levels and operating and development costs. As a result, estimated quantities of proved reserves and projections of future production rates and the timing of development expenditures may be inaccurate.\nOur estimates of proved reserves are based on prices and costs determined at the date of the estimate. Any significant variance from these prices and costs could greatly affect our estimates of reserves. We prepare our own estimates of proved reserves, which are audited by independent third party petroleum engineers. Over time, our internal engineers may make material changes to reserves estimates taking into account the results of actual drilling, testing and production. For additional information about these risks and their impact on our reserves, see \u201cItems 1 and 2. Business and Properties-Oil and Gas Data-Proved Reserves\u201d and \u201cSupplementary Information to Consolidated Financial Statements-Supplementary Oil and Gas Information (unaudited)-Analysis of Changes in Proved Reserves\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nUnless we replace our oil, natural gas and NGLs reserves, our reserves and production will decline, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nProducing oil, natural gas and NGL reservoirs generally are characterized by declining production rates that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors. The rate of decline may be different than we have estimated and may change over time. Our future oil, natural gas and NGL reserves and production, and therefore our cash flow and income, are highly dependent upon our success in efficiently developing and exploiting our current reserves and economically finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves. We may not be able to develop, find or acquire additional reserves to replace our current and future production at acceptable costs.\nProperties that we buy may not produce as projected and we may be unable to determine reserve potential, identify liabilities associated with the properties or obtain protection from sellers.\nOne of our strategies is to capitalize on opportunistic acquisitions of oil, natural gas and NGLs reserves. Our reviews of acquired properties are inherently incomplete, because it generally is not feasible to review in depth every individual property involved in each acquisition. Ordinarily, we will focus our review efforts on the higher value properties and will sample the remaining properties for reserve potential. However, even a detailed review of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems, nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess fully their deficiencies and potential. Inspections may not always be performed on every well, and environmental problems, such as ground water contamination, are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. Even when problems are identified, we often assume certain environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties.\nOur hedging activities could result in financial losses or could reduce our income.\nTo achieve a more predictable cash flow and to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in the prices of commodities, we currently, and will likely in the future, enter into hedging arrangements for a portion of our production revenues. Hedging arrangements for a portion of our production revenues expose us to the risk of financial loss in some circumstances, including when:\n\u2022there is a change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the hedging agreement and actual prices received;\n\u2022our production is less than we expect;\n\u2022there is a change in the mark to market value of our derivatives; or\n\u2022the counterparty to the hedging contract defaults on its contractual obligations.\nIn addition, these types of hedging arrangements limit the benefit we would receive from increases in commodities prices and may expose us to cash margin requirements if we hedge with counterparties who are not parties to our Credit Facility.\nOur counterparties are financial institutions that are lenders under our Credit Facility or affiliates of such lenders. The risk that a counterparty may default on its obligations increases when overall economic conditions deteriorate. Losses resulting from adverse economic conditions or other factors may affect the ability of the counterparties to meet their obligations to us on hedge transactions, which could reduce our revenues from hedges at a time when we are also receiving lower prices for our production. As a result, our financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nThe inability of one or more of our customers to meet their obligations may adversely affect our financial results.\nSubstantially all of our accounts receivable result from oil, natural gas and NGLs sales or joint interest billings to third parties in the energy industry. This concentration of customers and joint interest owners may impact our overall credit risk in that these entities may be similarly affected by changes in economic and other conditions. In addition, our oil, natural gas and NGLs hedging arrangements expose us to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties.\nWe face risks related to rating agency downgrades.\nIf one or more rating agencies downgrades our outstanding debt, future debt issuance could become more difficult and costly. Also, we may be required to provide collateral or other credit support to certain counterparties, which would increase our costs and limit our liquidity.\nOur business could be negatively impacted by security threats, including cyber-security threats, and other disruptions.\nAs an oil and natural gas producer, we face various security threats, including cyber-security threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information, acquire cash or other assets through theft or fraud or render data or systems unusable, threats to the safety of our employees, threats to the security of our facilities and infrastructure or third party facilities and infrastructure, such as processing plants and pipelines, and threats from terrorist acts. Cyber-security attacks in particular are evolving and include but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, corruption of data or misappropriation of assets. There can be no assurance that the procedures and controls we use to monitor and mitigate these risks will be sufficient in preventing security threats from materializing. If any of these events were to materialize, they could lead to losses of sensitive information, assets, critical infrastructure, personnel or capabilities essential to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile, which may make it difficult for shareholders to sell our common stock when desired or at attractive prices.\nThe market price of our common stock is highly volatile. Adverse events could trigger a significant decline in the trading price of our common stock, including, among others, unfavorable changes in commodity prices or commodity price expectations, adverse regulatory developments and adverse developments relating to the Merger. Furthermore, general market conditions, including the level of, and fluctuations in, the trading prices of equity securities generally could affect the price of our stock. The stock markets frequently experience price and volume volatility that affects many companies\u2019 stock prices, often in ways unrelated to the operating performance of those companies. In addition, the trading price of our common stock may be increased at times by market phenomena such as significant increases in retail investor interest and purchases to cover short positions. If so, those market phenomena could reverse themselves at any time, leading to a rapid and substantial decline in the price of our stock.\nIf we cannot meet the financial compliance standards for continued listing on the New York Stock Exchange (the \u201cNYSE\u201d), the NYSE may delist our common stock, which could have an adverse impact on the trading volume, liquidity and market price of our common stock.\nA delisting of our common stock from the NYSE could negatively impact us because it could reduce the liquidity and market price of our common stock and reduce the number of investors willing to hold or acquire our common stock, which could negatively impact our ability to raise equity financing, and/or diminish the value of equity incentives available to provide\nto our employees. The NYSE Listed Company Manual has a set of financial compliance standards we must meet to avoid being delisted from the NYSE. The financial compliance standards are defined below:\n\u2022average market capitalization of not less than $50 million over a 30 trading day period and stockholders\u2019 equity of not less than $50 million;\n\u2022average closing share price of $1.00 over a 30 trading day period; and\n\u2022average market capitalization of not less than $15 million over a 30 day trading period, which is a minimum threshold for continued listing with no cure period.\nOn March 10, 2020, we were notified by the NYSE that the average closing price of our common stock over the prior 30- consecutive trading day period was below $1.00. On October 30, 2020, we completed a 1-for-50 reverse stock split of our common stock to satisfy this requirement. The reverse stock split reduced the number of shares of our outstanding common stock from 215,255,925 shares as of October 30, 2020 to 4,305,119 shares, subject to adjustment of the rounding of fractional shares.\nOn November 4, 2020, we were notified by the NYSE that our average market capitalization was less than $50 million over the prior 30-consecutive trading day period along with a stockholders\u2019 equity balance of less than $50 million. As set forth in the notice, as of November 3, 2020, our prior 30-consecutive trading day average market capitalization was $42.5 million and our last reported shareholders\u2019 equity as of June 30, 2020 was $2.2 million. In accordance with NYSE listing requirements, we submitted a plan on December 18, 2020 advising the NYSE of definitive action we have taken, or are taking, to bring us into conformity within 18 months of November 4, 2020. On January 28, 2021, the NYSE accepted our plan allowing our common stock to continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE during the cure period, subject to our compliance with the plan and other continued listing standards. The NYSE will review our compliance with the plan on a quarterly basis. If we fail to comply with the plan or do not meet continued listing standards at the end of the 18-month cure period, we will be subject to the prompt initiation of NYSE suspension and delisting procedures. Further, if our average market capitalization goes below $15 million over a 30-consecutive trading day period, there is no cure period for continued listing on the NYSE.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law make it more difficult to effect a change in control of us, which could adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nDelaware corporate law and our current certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could delay, defer or prevent a change in control of us or our management. These provisions include:\n\u2022giving the board the exclusive right to fill all board vacancies;\n\u2022requiring special meetings of stockholders to be called only by the board;\n\u2022requiring advance notice for stockholder proposals and director nominations;\n\u2022prohibiting stockholder action by written consent;\n\u2022prohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors; and\n\u2022allowing for authorized but unissued common and preferred shares.\nThese provisions also could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions that are opposed by our board. As a result, these provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders, and this may limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.\nRisks Related to Tax\nWe may incur more taxes as a result of new tax legislation.\nThe Tax Cut and Jobs Act (the \u201cTCJA\u201d) was passed in December 2017 and included provisions that could limit certain tax deductions:\n\u2022interest expense is limited to 30% of our taxable income (with certain adjustments);\n\u2022expanded Section 162(m) limitations on the deductibility of officers\u2019 compensation; and\n\u2022net operating losses (\u201cNOL\u201d) incurred after 2017 are limited to 80% of taxable income but can be carried forward indefinitely.\nThese changes may increase our future tax liability in some circumstances. In addition, proposals are made from time to time to amend U.S. federal and state income tax laws in ways that would be adverse to us, including by eliminating certain key\nU.S. federal income tax preferences currently available with respect to crude oil and natural gas exploration and production. The changes could include (i) the repeal of the percentage depletion deduction for crude oil and natural gas properties, (ii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs and (iii) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. Also, state severance taxes may increase in the states in which we operate. This could adversely affect our existing operations in the relevant state and the economic viability of future drilling.\nOur future utilization of NOLs and tax credit carryforwards have been limited by the 2018 Merger and may be further limited based on current Internal Revenue Code restrictions.\nWe have significant deferred tax assets for Federal and state NOL carryforwards. Subject to certain limitations and applicable expiration dates, these tax attributes can be carried forward to reduce our federal income tax liability for future periods. Under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), the ability to utilize NOL carryforwards to offset future taxable income is subject to limitation if a greater than 50% ownership change occurs (\u201cSection 382 change of ownership\u201d). A Section 382 change of ownership refers to an increase in ownership of more than 50% of our shares by certain groups of shareholders during any three-year period, as determined under certain conventions.\nThe 2018 Merger resulted in a Section 382 change of ownership, limiting our ability to use pre-change NOLs and credits against post-change taxable income to an annual limitation amount plus certain built-in gains recognized within five years of the ownership change (\u201cRBIG\u201d). The annual limitation amount of $11.7 million was computed by multiplying our fair market value on the date of the ownership change by a published long-term tax-exempt bond rate. Our RBIG is projected to be $176.9 million. We have reduced our federal and state NOLs by $274.7 million and $13.1 million, respectively, and eliminated our state tax credits by $8.2 million to reflect the expected impact of the Section 382 change of ownership. Deferred tax assets and the corresponding valuation allowance have been reduced by $65.0 million for the expected tax-effected impact of the Section 382 change of ownership.\nOur future utilization of NOLs and tax credit carryforwards may be further limited in the event of any future ownership changes, including the pending Merger with Bonanza Creek.", "PERMNO": 90494, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "HPR"}
