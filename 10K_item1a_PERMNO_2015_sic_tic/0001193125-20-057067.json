{"cik": "751978", "company": "VICOR CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-28", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K\ncontains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements as a result of, among other factors, the risk factors set forth below.\nOur future operating results are difficult to predict and are subject to fluctuations.\nOur operating results, including revenues, gross margins, operating expenses, and net income (loss), have fluctuated on a quarterly and annual basis. Our focus on higher volume opportunities with OEMs, ODMs, and contract manufacturers has caused the actions of a relative few such customers to disproportionately influence our operating results. Unanticipated delays in purchase orders from, and shipments to, certain large customers have resulted in lower than expected revenue. Despite our profitability during 2019, we cannot predict if we will maintain sustained profitability. Our future operating results may be materially influenced by a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022 changes in demand for our products and for our customers\u2019 end-products\nincorporating our products, as well as our ability to respond efficiently to such changes in demand, including changes in delivery lead times and the volume of product for which orders are accepted and the product shipped within an individual quarter;\n\u2022 our ability to manage our supply chain, inventory levels, and our own manufacturing capacity or that of third-party partners, particularly in the event of delays or cancellation of significant customer orders;\n\u2022 our ability to effectively coordinate changes in the mix of products we manufacture and sell, while managing our ongoing transition in organizational focus to Advanced Products from Brick Products;\n\u2022 our ability to provide and maintain a high level of sales and engineering support to an increasing number of demanding, high volume customers;\n\u2022 the ability of our third party suppliers, service subcontractors, and manufacturers to supply us with sufficient quantities of high quality products, components, and/or services on a timely basis;\n\u2022 the effectiveness of our ongoing efforts to continuously reduce product costs and manage operating expenses;\n\u2022 our ability to utilize our manufacturing facilities and personnel at efficient levels, maintaining sufficient production capacity and necessary manufacturing yields;\n\u2022 our ability to plan, schedule, execute, and fund capacity expansion, including the anticipated addition in 2020 of approximately 90,000 square feet to our Andover manufacturing facility;\n\u2022 the timing of our new product introductions and our ability to meet customer expectations for timely delivery of fully qualified products;\n\u2022 the timing of new product introductions or other competitive actions (e.g., product price reductions) by our competitors;\n\u2022 the ability to hire, retain, and motivate qualified employees to meet the demands of our customers;\n\u2022 intellectual property disputes;\n\u2022 potential significant litigation-related costs;\n\u2022 adverse economic conditions in the United States and those international markets in which we operate, as well as our ability to respond to rapid developments, such as the imposition of tariffs or trade restrictions;\n\u2022 adverse budgetary conditions within the U.S. government, particularly the Department of Defense, which continue to influence spending on current and anticipated programs into which we sell or anticipate to sell our products;\n\u2022 costs related to compliance with increasing worldwide governance, quality, environmental, and other regulations; and\n\u2022 the effects of events outside of our control, including natural disasters, public health emergencies, terrorist activities, political risks, international conflicts, information security breaches, communication interruptions, and other force majeure\n.\nAs a result of these and other factors, we cannot assure you we will not experience significant fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis. In addition, if our operating results do not meet the expectations of investors, the market price of our Common Stock may decline.\nOur stock price has been volatile and may fluctuate in the future.\nBecause of the factors set forth above and below, among others, the trading price of our Common Stock has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significantly:\n\u2022 volatility of the financial markets, notably the equity markets in the United States;\n\u2022 uncertainty regarding the prospects of domestic and foreign economies, including the impact of tariffs, trade restrictions, and volatile currency exchange rates;\n\u2022 uncertainty regarding domestic and international political conditions, including tax and tariff policies;\n\u2022 actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating performance or that of our competitors;\n\u2022 the performance and prospects of our major customers;\n\u2022 announcements by us or our competitors of significant new products, technical innovations, or litigation;\n\u2022 investor perception of the Company and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022 the liquidity of the market for our Common Stock, reflecting a relatively low trading float and relatively low average trading volumes;\n\u2022 the uncertainty of the declaration and payment of future cash dividends on our Common Stock; and\n\u2022 the concentration of ownership of our Common Stock by Dr. Vinciarelli, our Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, and President.\nIn the past, we have declared and paid cash dividends on our Common Stock. The payment of dividends is based on the periodic determination by our Board of Directors that we have adequate capital to fund anticipated operating requirements and that excess cash is available for distribution to stockholders via a dividend. We have no formal policy regarding dividends and, as such, investors cannot make assumptions regarding the possibility of future dividend payments nor the amounts and timing thereof. As of December 31, 2019, we have no plans to declare or pay a cash dividend.\nThe ownership of our Common Stock is concentrated between Dr. Vinciarelli and a limited number of institutional investors. As of December 31, 2019, Dr. Vinciarelli was the beneficial owner of 9,861,605 shares of our Common Stock, plus 311,954 shares which Dr. Vinciarelli has the right to acquire upon exercise of options to purchase Common Stock within 60 days of December 31, 2019. He also holds 11,023,648 shares of our unregistered Class B Common Stock (which may only be sold or transferred after required conversion, on a one-for-one\nbasis, into registered shares of Common Stock), together with his ownership of Common Stock, represents 52.9% of our total issued and outstanding shares of capital stock. Accordingly, the market float for our\nCommon Stock and average daily trading volumes are relatively small, which may negatively impact investors\u2019 ability to buy or sell shares of our Common Stock in a timely manner.\nDr. Vinciarelli owns 93.8% of the issued and outstanding shares of our Class B Common Stock, which possess 10 votes per share. Dr. Estia J. Eichten, a member of our Board of Directors, owns the majority of the balance of the Class B Common Stock issued and outstanding. As such, Dr. Vinciarelli, controlling in aggregate 81.6% of our outstanding voting securities, has effective control of our governance.\nGlobal economic uncertainty could materially and adversely affect our business and consolidated operating results.\nDuring 2019, global economic conditions varied by region. Domestic industrial and defense electronics market segments were steady for the year. However, conditions in China, our largest international market, continued to deteriorate through the year, contributing to the cyclical decline of certain markets and geographies around the world. Conditions in the enterprise computing supply chain, notably those associated with the data center and hyperscaler categories, caused customer uncertainty across Asia and reduced demand for our products. Our exports to China declined through the year, in part, due to the imposition by China of tariffs on certain U.S. goods imported into China in response to the imposition of Section 301 Tariffs on certain imported Chinese goods by the United States. In addition, our near-term forecasts of Chinese demand for our products may be revised if the negative impact of the coronavirus on the Chinese economy is sustained.\nDisruption and further deterioration of global economic conditions, including extended trade disputes, the relative strength of the U.S. Dollar, and rising interest rates, may reduce end-demand\nfor our customers\u2019 products and, in turn, their purchases of our products, thereby reducing our revenues and earnings. In addition, such adverse conditions may, among other things, result in increased price competition for our products, notably in Brick Product categories, increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories, increased risk in the collectability of our accounts receivable from our customers, increased risk in potential reserves for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable, and higher operating costs as a percentage of revenues.\nWe compete with many companies possessing far greater resources.\nSome of our competitors have far greater financial, manufacturing, technical, and sales and marketing resources than we possess or have access to. Our Brick Products compete with those products offered by domestic and foreign manufacturers of integrated power supplies and related power conversion components. With our Advanced Product lines, we compete with global IDMs and fabless developers of semiconductor-based power management modules and power management ICs. These competitors have far larger organizations and broader semiconductor-based product lines. Competition is generally based on product performance, design flexibility (i.e., ease of use), product price, and product availability, but with the relative importance of these factors varying among products, markets, and customers.\nExisting or new competitors may develop products or technologies that more effectively address the demands of our customers and markets with enhanced performance, features and functionality, or lower cost. Larger competitors frequently seek to maintain market share and protect customer relationships through heavily-discounted pricing, which we may not be able to match. If we fail to develop and commercialize leading-edge technologies and products that are cost effective and maintain high standards of quality, and introduce them to the market on a timely basis, our competitive position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nOur future success depends upon our ability to develop and market differentiated, leading-edge power conversion products for larger customers, potentially contributing to lengthy product development and sales cycles that may result in significant expenditures before revenues are generated. Our future operating results are dependent on the growth in such customers\u2019 businesses and on our ability to profitably develop and deliver products meeting customer requirements.\nThe power system industry and the industries in which many of our customers operate are characterized by intense competition, rapid technological change, quickened product obsolescence, and price erosion for mature products, each of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. We are following a strategy based on the development of differentiated Advanced Products addressing what we believe to be the long-term limitations of traditional power architectures, while at the same time sustaining sales and profitability of our well-established Brick Products. The development of new, innovative products is often a complex, time-consuming, and costly process involving significant investment in research and development, with no assurance of return on investment. Although we have introduced many Advanced Products over recent years, there can be no assurance we will be able to continue to develop and introduce new and improved products and power system concepts in a timely or efficient manner. Similarly, there can be no assurance recently introduced or to be developed products will achieve customer acceptance.\nOur future success depends substantially upon customer acceptance of our innovative Advanced Products, notably our Power-on-Package\nconcept in AI and other high-performance applications. As we have been in the early stages of market penetration for these and other Advanced Products, we have experienced lengthy periods during which we have focused our product development efforts on the specific requirements of a limited number of large customers, followed by further periods of delay before meaningful purchase orders are received. These lengthy development and sales cycle times increase the possibility a customer may decide to cancel or change product plans, which could reduce or eliminate our sales to that customer. As a result, we may incur significant product development expenses, as well as significant sales and marketing expenses, before we generate the related revenues for these products. Furthermore, we may never generate the anticipated revenues from a product after incurring such expenses if our customer cancels or changes its product plans.\nWe continue to shift our go-to-market\nstrategy to focus on larger opportunities with global OEMs, ODMs, and contract manufacturers. Our growth is therefore dependent on: the pace at which these OEMs and ODMs develop their own new products; the acceptance of our Advanced Products by these OEMs and ODMs; and the success of the customers\u2019 products incorporating our Advanced Products. If we fail to anticipate changes in our customers\u2019 businesses and their changing product needs or do not successfully identify and enter new markets, our results of operations and financial position could be negatively impacted.\nIn 2019, we expanded our dedicated sales effort to penetrate the automotive market with our Advanced Products, notably in the rapidly expanding 48V opportunity within the electric vehicle and mild hybrid vehicle market segments. The automotive market is dominated by relatively few global OEMs and \u201ctiers\u201d of well-established suppliers. Penetrating this market will be challenging and we may not be successful in doing so. Additionally, our early success with vendors of AI computing solutions may not translate into long-term success with customers participating in the long-term development of autonomous driving solutions.\nWe cannot offer any assurance the markets we currently serve will grow in the future, our Advanced Products or Brick Products will meet respective market requirements, or we can maintain adequate gross margins or operating profits in these markets.\nOur operating results recently have been influenced by a limited number of customers, and our future results may be similarly influenced.\nSince the introduction of our Advanced Products, the Company has derived a substantial portion of its revenue from Advanced Products in any given year from either one customer or a limited number of customers,\nwhether through sales directly to the customer(s) or indirectly to the customers\u2019 contract manufacturers. This concentration of revenue is a reflection of the relatively early stage of adoption of the Advanced Products and the associated technologies and power system architectures, and our targeting of market leading innovators as initial customers. A consequence of customer concentration was the significant decline in bookings and shipments from an important hyperscaler customer during the first two quarters of 2019, while that customer transferred production capacity from China to Taiwan in response to the tariffs charged on imported materials, including our products. Once this transfer of production was completed, booking and shipment activity resumed during the third quarter of 2019.\nOur current sales and marketing efforts are focused primarily on accelerating the adoption of Advanced Products by a diversified customer base, across a number of identified market segments. However, we cannot assure you our strategy will be successful and such diversification of customers will be achieved.\nWe may not be able to procure necessary key components or raw materials, or we may purchase excess raw material inventory or unusable inventory, which increases the risk of reserve charges to reduce the value of any inventory deemed excess or obsolete, thereby reducing our profitability.\nThe power systems industry, and the electronics industry as a whole, can be subject to pronounced, lengthy business cycles and otherwise subject to sudden and sharp changes in demand. Our success, in part, is dependent on our ability to forecast and procure inventories of components and materials to match production schedules and customer delivery requirements. Many of our products require raw materials supplied by a limited number of vendors and, in some instances, a single vendor. During certain periods, key components or materials required to build our products may become unavailable in the timeframe required for us to meet our customers\u2019 needs. Our inability to secure sufficient raw materials to manufacture products for our customers has reduced, in the past, our revenue and profitability and could do so again.\nWe may choose, and have chosen, to mitigate our inventory risks by increasing the levels of inventory for certain components and materials. Such increased inventory levels may increase the potential risk for excess or obsolete inventories, should our forecasts fail to materialize or if there are negative factors impacting our customers\u2019 end markets, leading to order cancellation. If we identify excess inventory or determine certain inventory is obsolete (i.e., unusable), we likely will record additional inventory reserves (i.e., expenses representing the write-off\nof the excess or obsolete inventory), which could have an adverse effect on our gross margins and on our operating results.\nWe rely on third-party vendors and subcontractors for supply of components, assemblies, and services and, therefore, cannot control the availability or quality of such components, assemblies, and services.\nWe depend on third-party vendors and subcontractors to supply components, assemblies, and services used in our products, some of which are supplied by a single vendor, and have experienced shortages of certain semiconductor components, incurred additional and unexpected costs to address the shortages, and experienced delays in production and shipping. In 2019, we increased our dependence on a highly-specialized electroplating contractor for meeting our near-term volume expectations for our SM-ChiP\nline. While commodity electroplating services are available from numerous alternate providers, we have developed certain proprietary processes with this contractor. As such, any interruption or delay of production by the contractor could have an adverse effect on our delivery of SM-ChiP\nmodules to our customers.\nIf suppliers or subcontractors cannot provide their products or services on time or to our specifications, we may not be able to meet the demand for our products and our delivery times may be negatively affected. In addition, we cannot directly control the quality of the products and services provided by third parties. In order to expand revenue, we likely will need to identify and qualify new suppliers and subcontractors to supplant or replace existing suppliers and subcontractors, which may be a time-consuming and expensive process. In addition, any qualification of new suppliers may require customers of our products utilizing products and\nservices from new suppliers and service providers to undergo a re-qualification\nprocess. Such circumstances likely would lead to disruptions in our production, increased manufacturing costs, delays in shipping to our customers, and/or increases in prices paid to third parties for products and services. In addition, visibility into our Chinese supply chain has been recently clouded by the uncertain impact of the coronavirus on the personnel and operations of our Chinese vendors. We are in frequent contact with our critical vendors in China, and are monitoring the situation closely.\nWe are exposed to foreign economic, political, and other external risks.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, revenues from sales outside the United States were 53.7%, 62.0%, and 63.2%, respectively, of our total revenues. Net revenues from customers in China, our largest international market, accounted for approximately 22.1% of total net revenues in 2019, approximately 37.4% in 2018, and approximately 35.8% in 2017, respectively. We expect international sales will continue to be a significant component of total sales, since many of the OEMs and ODMs we target as customers are domiciled offshore, and such customers increasingly utilize offshore contract manufacturers, and rely upon those contract manufacturers to place orders directly with us. We also expect international revenue from our distributors to increase.\nWhile our currency risks are limited, as our sales are denominated in U.S. Dollars worldwide, with the exception of Yen-based\nsales by VJCL in Japan, our international activities expose us to special risks including, but not limited to, regulatory requirements, economic and political instability, transportation delays, foreign currency controls, trade restrictions and tariffs, and unfavorable shifts in foreign exchange rates. Our international customers\u2019 business may be negatively affected by the imposition of tariffs, as was the case in 2018 and 2019 with the imposition of Section 301 Tariffs on certain Chinese goods imported into the United States and the corresponding imposition of import tariffs by China on certain U.S. goods imported into China, and by economic sanctions, as were imposed by the United States on certain Chinese enterprises and individuals in 2019 and on certain Russian enterprises and individuals in 2014.\nIn addition, as noted elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, recent uncertainty associated with the extent of the negative impact of the coronavirus outbreak in China may cause us to revise our near-term forecast of Chinese demand and to closely assess the ability of our Chinese vendors to meet our near-term supply requirements.\nSudden or unexpected changes in the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nWe may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights, which may limit our ability to compete effectively.\nWe operate in an industry in which the ability to compete depends on the development or acquisition of proprietary technologies that must be protected to preserve the exclusive use of such technologies. We devote substantial resources to establish and protect our patents and proprietary rights, and we rely on patent and intellectual property law to protect such rights. This protection, however, may not prevent competitors from independently developing products similar or superior to our products. We may be unable to protect or enforce current patents, may rely on unpatented technology that competitors could restrict or replicate, or may be unable to acquire patents in the future, all of which may have a material adverse effect on our competitive position. In addition, the intellectual property laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as those of the United States. We have been and may need to continue to defend or challenge patents. We have incurred and expect to incur significant financial costs in the defense of our patented technologies and have devoted and expect to devote significant resources to these efforts which, if unsuccessful, may have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial position.\nWe face intellectual property infringement claims that could be disruptive to operations and costly to resolve and may encounter similar infringement claims in the future.\nThe power supply industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights. We have in the past and may in the future receive communications from third parties asserting that our products or manufacturing processes infringe on a third party\u2019s patent or other intellectual property rights. Such assertions, if publicly disclosed, have in the past and may in the future inhibit the willingness of potential customers to purchase certain of our products. In the event a third party makes a valid intellectual property claim against us and a license is not available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, we could be forced to either redesign or stop production of products incorporating that technology, and our operating results could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, litigation may be necessary to defend us against claims of infringement, and this litigation could be costly, extend over a lengthy period of time, and divert the attention of key personnel. An adverse outcome in these types of matters could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.\nPlease see Part I, Item 3 - \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d for information regarding current litigation related to our intellectual property.\nAny expenses or liability resulting from the outcome of litigation could adversely influence our operating results and financial condition.\nFrom time to time, we may be subject to claims or litigation, including intellectual property litigation as described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAny such claims or litigation may be time-consuming and costly, divert management resources, require us to change our products, or have other adverse effects on our business. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and could require us to pay significant monetary damages.\nThe outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. An estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is considered probable an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred. In determining whether a loss should be accrued, we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our financial statements. As of December 31, 2019, our evaluation led us to conclude no accrual of a loss contingency was warranted.\nWe may face legal claims and litigation from product warranty or other claims that could be costly to resolve.\nWe have in the past and may in the future encounter legal action from customers, vendors, or others concerning product warranty or other claims. We generally offer a two-year\nwarranty from the date title passes from us for all of our standard products. Effective January 1, 2017, we extended the warranty period to three years for a range of H Grade, M Grade and MI Family DC-DC\nlegacy products sold after that date. In a limited number of circumstances, we have entered into supply contracts with certain high-volume customers calling for extended warranty terms. With our distribution partners, we also enter into contracts providing for our product warranties to transfer to the end customer upon final sale of our product(s) by the distributor.\nWe invest significant resources in the testing of our products; however, if any of our products contain defects, we may be required to incur additional development and remediation costs, pursuant to our warranty policies. These issues may divert our technical and other resources from other product development efforts and could result in claims against us by our customers or others, including liability for costs associated with product returns, which may adversely influence our operating results. If any of our products contain defects, or have\nreliability, quality, or compatibility problems, the Company\u2019s reputation may be damaged, which could make it more difficult for us to sell our products to existing and prospective customers and could adversely affect our operating results. We are currently party to a limited number of supply agreements with certain customers contractually committing us to warranty and indemnification requirements exceeding those to which we have been exposed in the past. While we maintain insurance coverage for such exposure, we could incur significant financial cost beyond the limits of such coverage, as well as operational disruption and damage to our competitive position and image if faced with a significant product warranty or other claim.\nExtended interruption of production at our manufacturing facility in Andover, Massachusetts, could materially reduce our revenue and increase costs.\nThe majority of our power components and power systems, whether for direct sale to customers or for sale to our subsidiaries for incorporation into their respective products, are manufactured at our Andover facility. Substantial damage to this facility due to fire, natural disaster, power loss, or other events, including events associated with our planned expansion of the facility in 2020, could interrupt manufacturing. While we have never experienced any meaningful interruption of manufacturing in our history, any prolonged inability to utilize all or a significant portion of our Andover facility could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nGiven our intent to begin construction during the first half of 2020 of an approximately 90,000 square foot addition to our Andover facility, we have phased the construction schedule and otherwise developed procedures intended to minimize the disruption of our operations over the period of construction, which likely will extend into early 2021. Any prolonged disruption or delay in current production caused by construction could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nDisruption of our information technology infrastructure could adversely affect our business.\nWe depend heavily on our computing and communications infrastructure to achieve our business objectives, particularly for our financial and operational record keeping, our computer-integrated manufacturing processes controlling all aspects of our operations in our manufacturing facility in Andover, Massachusetts, our public website, and our email communications. We also rely on trusted third parties to provide certain infrastructure support services to us. If we or a third party service provider encounter a problem that impairs this infrastructure, the resulting disruption could impede the accuracy and timeliness of our financial reporting processes, and our ability to record or process customer orders, manufacture, and ship in a timely manner, or otherwise carry on business in the normal course. Our image and reputation also could be negatively affected by such circumstances. Additionally, we could incur material liabilities associated with the harm such impairment and disruption of our infrastructure may have on third parties including those associated with the unintentional release of confidential information and or sensitive data. While we carry business interruption insurance to offset financial losses from such an interruption, and cyber-risk insurance to address potential liabilities from such circumstances, such insurance may be insufficient to compensate us for the potentially significant costs or liabilities incurred. Any such events, if prolonged, could have a material and adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nOur systems are designed to protect us from network security incidents and associated disruptions. However, as evidenced by the ransomware incident described below, we remain vulnerable to computer viruses and related software-based challenges to the integrity of our systems, unauthorized or illegal break-ins, or malicious network hacking, equipment or software sabotage, acts of vandalism to our systems by third parties, and, in the extreme, forms of cyber-terrorism. Our security measures or those of our third party service provider detected, but did not prevent, the network security incident and the associated disruptions described below and may not detect or prevent such incidents and disruptions in the future.\nOn December 24, 2019, elements of our network were compromised by a form of malware referred to as \u201cransomware.\u201d The malware was introduced unintentionally into our network by a trusted service provider that\nhad access to our network for remote management of application patching and related system updates. The infection was spread in an automated manner through the download and distribution of malicious executables to systems in our network via an application used by the service provider. Only systems under the service provider\u2019s support were affected. The malware encrypted Windows-based files stored on PCs and on Windows-based servers across our global network. The malware did not encrypt Windows operating systems or Unix or Linux based files. On that same date, our network monitoring processes detected unusual network traffic volumes and patterns and automatically alerted management of the circumstances. Following established business continuity and disaster recovery policies and procedures, a cross-functional team of senior managers immediately began diagnosis of the circumstances and quickly determined the nature of the ransomware and the extent of the incident. In close collaboration with the service provider, a containment and recovery plan was developed and executed. Law enforcement authorities and our insurance providers were notified of the incident, and we immediately engaged outside counsel and forensic specialists with security expertise. The forensic specialists provided information to us to support our conclusion there was no evidence to indicate sensitive data was accessed, viewed, or exfiltrated from our environment as a result of this incident. Based on the forensic findings, we determined, in consultation with counsel the Company was not required to provide notification of this incident under applicable data breach notification laws. On December 25, 2019, the service provider obtained and distributed the necessary decryption key, and we began the process of recovering encrypted files and restoring system and operational functionality. Business functions were prioritized for restoration and, by the evening of December 26, 2019, we believe over 90% of encrypted resources had been recovered. We also believe we had restored all operations by the afternoon of December 27, 2019.\nSubsequent analysis by management and the forensic specialists we retained allowed us to conclude the incident had no material impact on our operations, financial condition and performance, or the integrity of our financial reporting systems. Management is developing a plan to enhance network and file security, reflecting the lessons learned from the incident and the restoration process. Our expectation is these enhancements to system monitoring, network and file access, and emergency procedures will be deployed during the first half of 2020, however there can be no assurance that these enhancements will be successful in detecting or preventing such an incident in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we were compliant with the comprehensive requirements for the protection of controlled unclassified information (\u201cCUI\u201d) as set forth in Special Publication 800-171 of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (\u201cNIST\u201d). The Company provides confidential information to third party business partners and/or receives confidential information from third party business partners in certain circumstances, when doing so is necessary to conduct business, particularly with departments of agencies of the U.S. Government. While we employ confidentiality agreements to protect other sensitive information (i.e., information not considered CUI), our own security measures or those of our third party service providers may not be sufficient to protect such information in the event the computing infrastructure of these third party business partners is compromised. Security incidents involving our computing and communications infrastructure or that of a third party business partner or service provider could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized release of confidential information belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers or suppliers, which could result in an interruption to our operations, result in a violation of privacy or other laws, expose us to a risk of litigation, or damage our reputation, any of which could have a material and adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Our network segmented NIST 800-171 environment was not impacted by the December 2019 ransomware incident, but there can be no assurance that it will not be impacted by similar incidents in the future, which could have a material and adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition for the reasons described above.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls over financial reporting or discover material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately or timely or detect fraud, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAn effective internal control environment is necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and is an important part of our effort to prevent financial fraud. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSOX\u201d) requires our management to report on, and our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\nWe have an ongoing program to perform the system and process evaluation and testing necessary to comply with the requirements of SOX and to continuously improve and, when necessary, remediate internal controls over financial reporting.\nWhile management evaluates the effectiveness of our internal controls on a regular basis, these controls may not always be effective. There are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of internal controls, including collusion, management override, and failure in human judgment. In addition, control procedures are designed to reduce rather than eliminate business risks. In the event our Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer, our certifying officers under SOX, or our independent registered public accounting firm determines our internal controls over financial reporting are not effective as defined under Section 404, we may be unable to produce reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, which could materially harm our business. In addition, we may be subject to sanctions or investigation by government authorities or self-regulatory organizations, such as the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC. Any such actions could affect investor perceptions of the Company and result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which could cause the market price of our Common Stock to decline or limit our access to capital.\nRegulations related to conflict minerals could adversely impact our business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act contains provisions to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of certain minerals, known as conflict minerals (including gold, tantalum, tin, and tungsten, and their related ores), originating from the Democratic Republic of Congo (\u201cDRC\u201d) and adjoining countries. As a result, in August 2012 the SEC released final rules for annual disclosure and reporting for those companies who use conflict minerals mined from the DRC and adjoining countries in their products. We began to implement processes within our supply chain to comply with these rules beginning in 2012 and filed our initial Form SD in May 2014. There have been and will continue to be costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including due diligence to determine the sources of conflict minerals used in our products and other potential changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. The implementation of these rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply, and pricing of materials used in our products. As there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering \u201cconflict free\u201d conflict minerals, we cannot be certain we will be able to obtain necessary conflict minerals from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Also, we may face reputational challenges if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflict free or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in our products through the procedures we may implement.\nOur ability to successfully implement our business strategy may be limited if we do not retain our key personnel and attract and retain skilled and experienced personnel.\nOur success depends on our ability to retain the services of our executive officers. The loss of one or more members of senior management could materially adversely influence our business and financial results. In particular, we are dependent on the services of Dr. Vinciarelli, our founder, Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, and President. The loss of the services of Dr. Vinciarelli could have a material adverse effect on our development of new products and on our results of operations. In addition, our research and development\nand marketing and sales activities depend on highly skilled engineers and other personnel with technical skills, who are in high demand and are difficult to replace. Our continued operations and growth depend on our ability to attract and retain skilled and experienced personnel in a very competitive employment market. If we are unable to attract and retain such employees, our ability to successfully implement our business strategy may be harmed.", "PERMNO": 76128, "SIC": 3679, "TIC": "VICR"}
