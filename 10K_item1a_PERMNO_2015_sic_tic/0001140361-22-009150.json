The general climate of declining sales of tobacco products is principally driven by the long-standing declines in cigarettes. OTP, on the other hand, as measured by MSAi, have continued to generate modest consumer unit volume gains. Additionally, cigarillo cigars and MYO cigar wraps have each demonstrated MSAi volume gains in recent years. Our tobacco products comprised approximately 68% of our total 2021 net sales and, while some of our sales volume declines have been offset by higher prices or by increased sales in other product categories, there can be no assurance that these price increases or increased sales can be sustained, especially in an environment of increased regulation, product characteristic restrictions, and taxation and changes in consumer spending habits.\nWe depend on a small number of key third-party suppliers and producers for our products.\nOur operations are largely dependent on a small number of key suppliers and producers to supply or manufacture our products pursuant to long-term contracts. In 2021, our two most important suppliers and producers were: (i) Swedish Match, which produces all of our loose leaf chewing tobacco in the U.S.; and (ii) RTI, which provides us with exclusive access to the Zig-Zag\u00ae cigarette paper and related accessories in the U.S. and Canada. See \u201cItem 1 - Business - Distribution and Supply Agreements\u201d\nAll of our loose-leaf tobacco products are manufactured for us by Swedish Match pursuant to a ten-year renewable agreement, which we entered into in 2008. The agreement will automatically be renewed for five successive ten-year terms unless either party provides at least 180 days\u2019 notice prior to a renewal term of its intent to terminate the agreement or unless otherwise terminated in accordance with the provisions of the agreement. If a notice of non-renewal is delivered, the contract will expire two years after the date on which the agreement would have otherwise been renewed. Under this agreement, we retain the rights to all marketing, distribution and trademarks over the loose-leaf brands that we own or license. The agreement renewed for an additional ten-year term in 2018. We share responsibilities with Swedish Match related to process control, manufacturing activities, quality control, and inventory management with respect to our loose-leaf products. We rely on the performance by Swedish Match of its obligations under the agreement for the production of our loose-leaf tobacco products. Any significant disruption in Swedish Match\u2019s manufacturing capabilities or our relationship with Swedish Match, a deterioration in Swedish Match\u2019s financial condition, or an industry-wide change in business practices with respect to loose leaf tobacco products could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nAll of our Zig-Zag\u00ae premium cigarette papers, cigarette tubes, and injectors are sourced from RTI, pursuant to the Distribution Agreements. In November 2020, Bollor\u00e9 sold its rights to its trademarks for the Zig-Zag\u00ae brand name in the U.S. and Canada to RTI and, in connection with the sale, assigned the Distribution Agreements and the License Agreements to RTI. RTI is an affiliate of one of our competitors. The Distribution Agreements were most recently renewed in 2012 and pursuant to such agreements, we renegotiate pricing terms every five years. The Distribution Agreements were initially entered into with Bollor\u00e9, the original holder of the cigarette paper-related trademarks for the Zig-Zag\u00ae brand name.\nPursuant to agreements with certain suppliers, we have agreed to store tobacco inventory purchased on our behalf and generally maintain a 12- to 24-month supply of our various tobacco products at their facilities. We cannot guarantee our supply of these products will be adequate to meet the demands of our customers. Further, a major fire, violent weather conditions, or other disasters that affect us or any of our key suppliers or producers, including RTI or Swedish Match, as well as those of our other suppliers and vendors, could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Although we have insurance coverage for some of these events, a prolonged interruption in our operations, as well as those of our producers, suppliers, or vendors, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, we do not know whether we will be able to renew any or all of our agreements on a timely basis, on terms satisfactory to us, or at all.\nAny disruptions in our relationships with RTI or Swedish Match or any other significant supplier, a failure to renew any of our agreements, an inability or unwillingness by any supplier to produce sufficient quantities of our products in a timely manner or finding a new supplier would have a significant impact on our ability to continue distributing the same volume and quality of products and maintain our market share, even during a temporary disruption, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be unable to identify or contract with new suppliers or producers in the event of a disruption to our supply of products.\nIn order to continue selling our products in the event of a disruption to our supply, we would have to identify new suppliers or producers that would be required to satisfy significant regulatory requirements. Only a limited number of suppliers or producers (if any) may have the ability to produce our products at the volumes we need, and it could be costly or time-consuming to locate and approve such alternative sources. Moreover, it may be difficult or costly to find suppliers to produce small volumes of our new products in the event we are looking only to supplement current supply as suppliers may impose minimum order requirements. In addition, we may be unable to negotiate pricing or other terms with our existing or new suppliers as favorable as those we currently enjoy. Even if we were able to successfully identify new suppliers and contract with them on favorable terms, these new suppliers would also be subject to stringent regulatory approval procedures that could result in prolonged disruptions to our sourcing and distribution processes.\nFurthermore, there is no guarantee that a new third-party supplier could accurately replicate the production process and taste profile of our existing products. We cannot guarantee that a failure to adequately replace our existing suppliers would not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur licenses to use certain brands and trademarks may be terminated or not renewed.\nWe are reliant upon brand recognition in the OTP markets in which we compete as the OTP industry is characterized by a high degree of brand loyalty and a reluctance to switch to new or unrecognizable brands on the part of consumers. Some of the brands and trademarks under which our products are sold are licensed to us for a fixed period of time in respect of specified markets, such as our Distribution and License Agreements for use of the Zig-Zag\u00ae name and associated trademarks in connection with certain of our cigarette papers and related products.\nWe have a number of Licensing Agreements with RTI. The first of these governs licensing, sourcing and the use of the Zig-Zag\u00ae name with respect to cigarette papers, cigarette tubes, and cigarette injector machines, the second of which governs licensing, sourcing and the use of the Zig-Zag\u00ae name with respect to e-cigarettes, vaporizers, and e-liquids, and the third of which governs the licensing, sourcing and use of the Zig-Zag trademark on paper cones. In 2021, we generated approximately $163 million in net sales of Zig-Zag\u00ae products, of which approximately $79 million was generated from products sold through the License Agreements. In the event that one or more of these Licensing Agreements are not renewed, the terms of the agreements bind us under a five-year non-compete clause, under which we cannot engage in direct or indirect manufacturing, selling, distributing or otherwise promoting of cigarette papers of a competitor to Zig-Zag\u00ae without RTI\u2019s consent, except in limited instances. We do not know whether we will renew these agreements on a timely basis, on terms satisfactory to us, or at all. As a result of these restrictions, if our licensing agreements with respect to the Zig-Zag\u00ae trademark are terminated, we may not be able to access the markets with recognizable brands that would be positioned to compete in these segments.\nIn the event that the licenses to use the brands and trademarks in our portfolio are terminated or are not renewed after the end of the term, there is no guarantee we will be able to find a suitable replacement, or if a replacement is found, that it will be on favorable terms. Any loss in our brand-name appeal to our existing customers as a result of the lapse or termination of our licenses could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe may not be successful in maintaining the consumer brand recognition and loyalty of our products.\nWe compete in a market that relies on innovation and the ability to react to evolving consumer preferences. The alternative smoking accessories and tobacco industries in general, and the OTP industry, in particular, are subject to changing consumer trends, demands, and preferences. Therefore, products once favored may over time become disfavored by consumers or no longer perceived as the best option. Consumers in the OTP market have demonstrated a high degree of brand loyalty, but producers must continue to adapt their products in order to maintain their status among these customers as the market evolves. The Zig-Zag\u00ae brand has strong brand recognition among smokers, and our continued success depends in part on our ability to continue to differentiate the brand names that we own or license and maintain similarly high levels of recognition with target consumers. Trends within the alternative smoking accessories and OTP industries change often. Our failure to anticipate, identify, or react to changes in these trends could, among other things, lead to reduced demand for our products. Factors that may affect consumer perception of our products include health trends and attention to health concerns associated with tobacco, price-sensitivity in the presence of competitors\u2019 products or substitute products, and trends in favor of new NewGen products that are currently being researched and produced by participants in our industry. For example, in recent years, we have witnessed a shift in consumer purchases from chewing tobacco to moist snuff due to its increased affordability. Along with our biggest competitors in the chewing tobacco market, which also produce moist snuff, we have been able to shift priorities and adapt to this change. A failure to react to similar trends in the future could enable our competitors to grow or establish their brands\u2019 market shares in these categories before we have a chance to respond.\nConsumer perceptions of tobacco-based products are likely to continue to shift, and our success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate these shifting tastes and the rapidity with which the markets in which we compete will evolve in response to these changes on a timely and affordable basis. If we are unable to respond effectively and efficiently to changing consumer preferences, the demand for our products may decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nRegulations may be enacted in the future, particularly in light of increasing restrictions on the form and content of marketing of tobacco products, that would make it more difficult to appeal to our consumers or to leverage existing recognition of the brands that we own or license. Furthermore, even if we are able to continue to distinguish our products, there can be no assurance that the sales, marketing, and distribution efforts of our competitors will not be successful in persuading consumers of our products to switch to their products. Many of our competitors have greater access to resources than we do, which better positions them to conduct market research in relation to branding strategies or costly marketing campaigns. Any loss of consumer brand loyalty to our products or reduction of our ability to effectively brand our products in a recognizable way will have a material effect on our ability to continue to sell our products and maintain our market share, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur distribution efforts rely in part on our ability to leverage relationships with large retailers and national chains.\nOur distribution efforts rely in part on our ability to leverage relationships with large retailers and national chains to sell and promote our products, which is dependent upon the strength of the brand names that we own or license and our salesforce effectiveness. In order to maintain these relationships, we must continue to supply products that will bring steady business to these retailers and national chains. We may not be able to sustain these relationships or establish other relationships with such entities, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to execute our branding strategies, our ability to access the end-user markets with our products or our ability to maintain our relationships with the producers of our products. For example, if we are unable to meet benchmarking provisions in contracts or if we are unable to maintain and leverage our retail relationships on a scale sufficient to make us an attractive distributor, it would have a material adverse effect on our ability to source products, and on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, there are factors beyond our control that may prevent us from leveraging existing relationships, such as industry consolidation. If we are unable to develop and sustain relationships with large retailers and national chains, or we are unable to leverage those relationships due to factors such as a decline in the role of brick-and-mortar retailers in North America, our capacity to maintain and grow brand and product recognition and increase sales volume will be significantly undermined. In such an event, we may ultimately be forced to pursue and rely on local and more fragmented sales channels, which will have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe face intense competition and may fail to compete effectively.\nWe are subject to significant competition across our segments and compete against companies in all segments that have access to significant resources in terms of technology, relationships with suppliers and distributors and access to cash flow and financial markets.\nThe OTP industry is characterized by brand recognition and loyalty, with product quality, price, marketing and packaging constituting the primary methods of competition. Substantial marketing support, merchandising display, competitive pricing and other financial incentives generally are required to introduce a new brand or to improve or maintain a brand\u2019s market position. Our principal competitors are \u201cbig tobacco,\u201d Altria Group, Inc. (formerly Phillip Morris) and British American Tobacco p.l.c. (formerly Reynolds) as well as Swedish Match, Swisher International and manufacturers of electronic cigarettes, including U.K.-based Imperial Brands PLC. These competitors are significantly larger than us and aggressively seek to limit the distribution or sale of other companies\u2019 products, both at the wholesale and retail levels. For example, certain competitors have entered into agreements limiting retail-merchandising displays of other companies\u2019 products or imposing minimum prices for OTP products, thereby limiting their competitors\u2019 ability to offer discounted products. In addition, the tobacco industry is experiencing a trend toward industry consolidation, most recently evidenced by the December 2018 investment in Juul Labs by Altria, the July 2017 acquisition of Reynolds American, Inc., by British American Tobacco p.l.c., and the June 2015 acquisition of Lorillard, Inc., by Reynolds American, Inc. Additional industry consolidation could result in a more competitive environment if our competitors are able to increase their combined resources, enhance their access to national distribution networks, or become acquired by established companies with greater resources than ours. Any inability to compete due to our smaller scale as the industry continues to consolidate and be dominated by \u201cbig tobacco\u201d could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\u201cBig tobacco\u201d has also established its presence in the NewGen products market and has begun to make investments in the alternative space. There can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully against these companies or any of our other competitors, some of which have far greater resources, capital, experience, market penetration, sales and distribution channels than us. In addition, there are currently relatively few U.S. restrictions on advertising electronic cigarettes and vaporizer products and competitors, including \u201cbig tobacco,\u201d may have more resources than us for advertising expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to build and maintain market share, and thus have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe competitive environment and our competitive position are also significantly influenced by economic conditions, the state of consumer confidence, competitors\u2019 introduction of low-priced products or innovative products, higher taxes, higher absolute prices and larger gaps between price categories and product regulation that diminishes the consumer\u2019s ability to differentiate tobacco products. Due to the impact of these factors, as well as higher state and local excise taxes and the market share of deep discount brands, the tobacco industry has become increasingly price competitive. As we seek to adapt to the price competitive environment, our competitors that are better capitalized may be able to sustain price discounts for long periods of time by spreading the loss across their expansive portfolios, with which we are not positioned to compete.\nCompetition from illicit sources may have an adverse effect on our overall sales volume, restricting the ability to increase selling prices and damaging brand equity.\nIllicit trade and tobacco trafficking in the form of counterfeit products, smuggled genuine products and locally manufactured products on which applicable taxes or regulatory requirements are evaded, represent a significant and growing threat to the legitimate tobacco industry. Factors such as increasing tax regimes, regulatory restrictions, and compliance requirements have resulted in more consumers switching to illegal, cheaper tobacco products and providing greater rewards for smugglers. We expect that this trend will continue and even accelerate if additional regulatory requirements make it more difficult or expensive to obtain genuine products. Illicit trade can have an adverse effect on our overall sales volume, restrict the ability to increase selling prices, damage brand equity and may lead to commoditization of our products.\nAlthough we combat counterfeiting of our products by engaging in certain tactics, such as requiring all sales force personnel to randomly collect our products from retailers in order to be reviewed for authenticity and using a private investigation firm to help perform surveillance of retailers we suspect are selling counterfeit products, no assurance can be given that we will be able to detect or stop sales of all counterfeit products. In addition, we have in the past and will continue to bring suits against retailers and distributors that sell certain counterfeit products. While we have been successful in securing financial recoveries from and helping to obtain criminal convictions of counterfeiters in the past, no assurance can be given that we will be successful in any such suits or that such suits will be successful in stopping other retailers or distributors from selling counterfeit products. Even if we are successful, such suits could consume a significant amount of management\u2019s time and could also result in significant expenses to the company. Any failure to track and prevent counterfeiting of our products could have a material adverse on our ability to maintain or effectively compete for the products we distribute under our brand names, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nContamination of, or damage to, our products could adversely impact sales volume, market share and profitability.\nOur market position may be affected through the contamination of our tobacco supply or products during the manufacturing process or at different points in the entire supply chain. We keep significant amounts of inventory of our products in warehouses and it is possible that this inventory could become contaminated during the storage period. In addition, our suppliers generally keep significant amounts of our inventory on hand and it is probable that such inventory could become contaminated even prior to arrival at our premises. If contamination of our inventory or packaged products occurs, whether as a result of a failure in quality control by us or by one of our suppliers, we may incur significant costs in replacing the inventory and recalling products. We may be unable to meet customer demand and may lose customers who purchase alternative brands or products. In addition, consumers may lose confidence in the affected product.\nUnder the terms of our contracts, we impose requirements on our major suppliers to maintain quality and comply with product specifications and requirements, and on our third-party co-manufacturer to comply with all federal, state and local laws. These third-party suppliers, however, may not continue to produce products that are consistent with our standards or that are in compliance with applicable laws, and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to identify instances in which our third-party suppliers fail to comply with our standards or applicable laws.\nA loss of sales volume from a contamination event may also affect our ability to supply our current customers and, in turn, recapture their business in the event they are forced to switch products or brands, even if on a temporary basis. We may also be subject to legal action as a result of a contamination, which could result in negative publicity and affect our sales. During this time, our competitors may benefit from an increased market share that could be difficult and costly to regain. Such a contamination event could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe market for NewGen products is subject to a great deal of uncertainty and is still evolving.\nVaporizer products and electronic cigarettes, having recently been introduced to market over the past ten years, are at a relatively early stage of development, and represent core components of a market that is evolving rapidly, highly regulated and characterized by a number of market participants. Rapid growth in the use of, and interest in, vaporizer products and electronic cigarettes is recent, and may not continue on a lasting basis. The demand and market acceptance for these products is subject to a high level of uncertainty. Therefore, we are subject to all of the business risks associated with a new enterprise in an evolving market. Continued evolution, uncertainty and the resulting increased risk of failure of our new and existing product offerings in this market could have a material adverse effect on our ability to build and maintain market share and on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Further, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to effectively compete in the NewGen products marketplace.\nComplications with the design or implementation of our new enterprise resource planning system could adversely impact our business and operations.\nWe rely extensively on information systems and technology to manage our business and summarize operating results. We are beginning to engage in what we expect will be a multi-year implementation of a new enterprise resource planning (\u201cERP\u201d) system. This ERP system will replace our existing operating and financial systems. The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain the Company\u2019s financial records, enhance operational functionality and provide timely information to the Company\u2019s management team related to the operation of the business. The ERP system implementation process will require the investment of significant personnel and financial resources. We may not be able to successfully implement the ERP without experiencing delays, increased costs and other difficulties. If we are unable to successfully design and implement the new ERP system as planned, or successfully update or integrate our systems when necessary, our financial positions, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted.\nRisks Related to Legal, Tax and Regulatory Matters\nWe are subject to substantial and increasing regulation.\nThe tobacco industry has been under public scrutiny for over 50 years. Industry critics include special interest groups, the U.S. Surgeon General, and many legislators and regulators at the local, state and federal levels. A wide variety of federal, state, and local laws limit the advertising, sale, and use of tobacco, and these laws have proliferated in recent years. For instance, on April 29, 2021, the FDA announced plans to propose two tobacco products standards related to combusted tobacco products: (1) a ban on menthol as a characterizing flavor of cigarettes; and (2) a ban on all characterizing flavors (including menthol) in cigars. Together with changing public attitudes towards tobacco consumption, the constant expansion of regulations has been a major cause of the overall decline in the consumption of tobacco products since the early 1970s. These regulations relate to, among other things, the importation of tobacco products and shipping throughout the U.S. market, increases in the minimum age to purchase tobacco products, imposition of taxes, sampling and advertising bans or restrictions, flavor bans or restrictions, ingredient and constituent disclosure requirements, and media campaigns and restrictions on where consumers may use tobacco products. Additional restrictions may be legislatively imposed or agreed to in the future. These limitations may make it difficult for us to maintain the value of any brand.\nMoreover, the current trend is toward increasing regulation of the tobacco industry, which is likely to differ between the various U.S. states and Canadian provinces in which we currently conduct the majority of our business. Extensive and inconsistent regulation by multiple states and at different governmental levels could prove to be particularly disruptive to our business as we may be unable to accommodate such regulations in a cost-effective manner that allows us to continue to compete in an economically viable way. Regulations are often introduced without the tobacco industry\u2019s input and have been a significant reason behind reduced industry sales volumes and increased illicit trade.\nIn 1986, federal legislation was enacted regulating smokeless tobacco products (including dry and moist snuff and chewing tobacco) by, among other things, requiring health warnings on smokeless tobacco packages and prohibiting the advertising of smokeless tobacco products on media subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Communications Commission (\u201cFCC\u201d). Since 1986, other proposals have been made at the federal, state, and local levels for additional regulation of tobacco products. It is likely that additional proposals will be made in the coming years. For example, the Prevent All Cigarette Trafficking Act (\u201cPACT Act\u201d) initially prohibited the use of the U.S. Postal Service to mail cigarette and smokeless tobacco products and also amended the Jenkins Act, which established cigarette sales reporting requirements for state excise tax collection, to require individuals and businesses that make interstate sales of certain cigarette or smokeless tobacco comply with state tax laws. The PACT Act was recently extended to also cover e-cigarette and related products. The extension of the PACT Act has resulted in increased costs and disruption to our NewGen business, and those costs may continue to rise if we are unable to adjust our operations to respond relative to our competitors. See \u201c-Many of our NewGen and cigar products have not obtained premarket authorization from the FDA and are currently marketed pursuant to a policy of FDA enforcement discretion, which could change. There could be a material adverse impact on our NewGen business development efforts if the FDA determines that our products are not subject to this compliance policy, or if our products become subject to increased regulatory compliance burdens imposed by the FDA and other regulatory or legislative bodies.\u201d for further details. Additional federal or state regulation relating to the manufacture, sale, distribution, advertising, labeling, mandatory ingredients disclosure and nicotine yield information disclosure of tobacco products could reduce sales, increase costs, and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOn June 22, 2009, the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (the \u201cTobacco Control Act\u201d) granted the FDA regulatory authority over tobacco products. The Act also amended the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act, which governs how cigarettes can be advertised and marketed, as well as the Comprehensive Smokeless Tobacco Health Education Act (\u201cCSTHEA\u201d), which governs how smokeless tobacco can be advertised and marketed. In addition to the FDA and FCC, we are subject to regulation by numerous other federal agencies, including the Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d), the Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d), the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (\u201cTTB\u201d), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (\u201cUSDA\u201d), the Consumer Product Safety Commission (\u201cCPSC\u201d), the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (\u201cCBP\u201d) and the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s (\u201cCDC\u201d) Office on Smoking and Health. There have also been adverse legislative and political decisions and other unfavorable developments concerning cigarette smoking and the tobacco industry, which we believe have received widespread public attention. The FDA has, and other governmental entities have, expressed concerns about the use of flavors in tobacco products and an interest in significant regulation of such use, up to and including bans in certain products. There can be no assurance as to the ultimate content, timing or effect of any regulation of tobacco products by governmental bodies, nor can there be any assurance that potential corresponding declines in demand resulting from negative media attention would not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Any such regulation has the potential to increase costs and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, ability to compete, and financial condition.\nOur products are regulated by the FDA, which has broad regulatory powers.\nThe vast majority of our 2021 U.S. net sales are derived from the sale of products that are currently regulated by the FDA. The Tobacco Control Act grants the FDA broad regulatory authority over the design, manufacture, sale, marketing and packaging of tobacco products. Among the regulatory powers conferred to the FDA under the Tobacco Control Act is the authority to impose tobacco product standards that are appropriate for the protection of the public health, require manufacturers to obtain FDA review and authorization for the marketing of certain new or modified tobacco products and impose various additional restrictions. Such restrictions may include requiring reduction or elimination of the use of particular constituents or components, requiring product testing, or addressing other aspects of tobacco product construction, constituents, properties or labeling.\nSpecifically, the Tobacco Control Act (i) increases the number of health warnings required on cigarette and smokeless tobacco products, increases the size of warnings on packaging and in advertising, requires the FDA to develop graphic warnings for cigarette packages, and grants the FDA authority to require new warnings, (ii) imposes restrictions on the sale and distribution of tobacco products, including significant restrictions on tobacco product advertising and promotion as well as the use of brand and trade names, (iii) bans the use of \u201clight,\u201d \u201cmild,\u201d \u201clow\u201d or similar descriptors on tobacco products, (iv) bans the use of \u201ccharacterizing flavors\u201d in cigarettes other than tobacco or menthol, (v) requires manufacturers to report ingredients and harmful constituents and requires the FDA to disclose certain constituent information to the public, (vi) authorizes the FDA to require the reduction of nicotine and the potential reduction or elimination of other constituents or additives, including menthol, (vii) establishes resource-intensive pre-market and \u201csubstantial equivalence\u201d review pathways for tobacco products that are considered new, (viii) gives the FDA broad authority to deny product applications thereby preventing the sale or distribution of the product subject to the application (and requiring such product to be removed from the market, if applicable), and (ix) requires tobacco product manufacturers (and certain other entities) to register with the FDA.\nThe FDA charges user fees based on the USDA unit calculations pro-rated to the annualized FDA congressionally allocated budget. These fees only apply to certain products currently regulated by the FDA, which include our core products (other than cigarette paper products), but we may in the future be required to pay such fees on more of our products, and we cannot accurately predict which additional products may be subject to such fees or the magnitude of such fees, which could become significant.\nAlthough the Tobacco Control Act prohibits the FDA from issuing regulations banning all cigarettes, all smokeless tobacco products, all little cigars, all cigars other than little cigars, all pipe tobacco, or all roll-your-own tobacco, or requiring the reduction of nicotine yields of a tobacco product to zero, it is likely that regulations with the FDA promulgated pursuant to the Tobacco Control Act could nonetheless result in a decrease in sales of these products in the U.S. We believe that such regulation could adversely affect our ability to compete against our larger competitors, who may be able to more quickly and cost-effectively comply with these new rules and regulations. Our ability to gain efficient and timely market clearance for new tobacco products, or even to keep existing products on the market, could also be affected by FDA rules, regulations and enforcement policies. Some of our currently marketed products that are subject to FDA regulation will require marketing authorizations from the FDA for us to continue marketing them (e.g., pre-market or substantial equivalence marketing authorizations, as applicable to the product), which we cannot guarantee we will be able to obtain. In addition, failure to comply with new or existing tobacco laws under which the FDA imposes regulatory requirements could result in significant financial penalties and government investigations of us. To the extent we are unable to respond to, or comply with, new FDA regulations it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nMany of our products contain nicotine, which is considered to be a highly addictive substance.\nMany of our products contain nicotine, a chemical that is considered to be highly addictive. The Tobacco Control Act empowers the FDA to regulate the amount of nicotine found in tobacco products, but not to require the reduction of nicotine yields of a tobacco product to zero. Any FDA regulation, whether of nicotine levels or other product attributes, may require us to reformulate, recall and/or discontinue certain of the products we may sell from time to time, which may have a material adverse effect on our ability to market our products and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are required to maintain cash amounts within an escrow account in order to be compliant with a settlement agreement between us and certain U.S. states and territories.\nIn November 1998, the major U.S. cigarette manufacturers entered into the Master Settlement Agreement (\u201cMSA\u201d) and the Smokeless Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement (\u201cSTMSA\u201d) with 46 U.S. states and certain U.S. territories and possessions. Pursuant to the MSA and subsequent states\u2019 statutes, a \u201ccigarette manufacturer\u201d (which is defined to also include a manufacturer of RYO/MYO cigarette tobacco) has the option of either becoming a signatory to the MSA, or, as we have elected, operating as a non-participating manufacturer (\u201cNPM\u201d) by funding and maintaining an escrow account, with sub-accounts on behalf of each settling state. These NPM escrow accounts are governed by states\u2019 escrow and complementary statutes that are generally monitored by the Office of the State Attorney General. The statutes require NPM companies to deposit, on an annual basis, into qualified banks\u2019 escrow funds based on the number of cigarettes or cigarette equivalents, which is measured by pounds of RYO/MYO tobacco sold. NPM companies are, within specified limits, entitled to direct the investment of the escrowed funds and withdraw any interest or appreciation, but cannot withdraw the principal for twenty-five years from the year of each annual deposit, except to withdraw funds deposited pursuant to an individual state\u2019s escrow statute to pay a final judgment to that state\u2019s plaintiffs in the event of such a final judgment. The investment vehicles available to us are specified in the state escrow agreements and are limited to low-risk government securities.\nVarious states have enacted or proposed complementary legislation intended to curb the activity of certain manufacturers and importers of cigarettes or MYO tobacco that are selling into MSA states without signing the MSA or who have failed to properly establish and fund a qualifying escrow account. We believe we have been fully compliant with all applicable laws, regulations, and statutes, although compliance-related issues may, from time to time, be disruptive to our business, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nAlthough no such legislation has been proposed or enacted, future changes to the MSA, such as legislation that extends the MSA to products to which it does not currently apply or legislation that limits the ability of companies to receive unused escrow funds after 25 years, may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Despite the amounts maintained and funded to the escrow account, compliance with the funding requirements for the escrow account does not necessarily prevent future federal and/or state regulations with respect to the OTP industry from having a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIncreases in tobacco-related taxes have been proposed or enacted and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted in numerous jurisdictions.\nTobacco products, premium cigarette papers and tubes have long been subject to substantial federal, state and local excise taxes. Such taxes have frequently been increased or proposed to be increased, in some cases significantly, to fund various legislative initiatives or further disincentivize tobacco usage. Since 1986, smokeless products have been subject to federal excise tax. Federally, smokeless products are taxed by weight (in pounds or fractional parts thereof) manufactured or imported.\nSince the State Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (\u201cS-CHIP\u201d) reauthorization in early 2009, which utilizes, among other things, taxes on tobacco products to fund health insurance coverage for children, the federal excise tax increases adopted have been substantial and have materially reduced sales in the \u201croll your own\u201d (\u201cRYO\u201d) /MYO cigarette smoking products market, and also caused volume declines in other markets. Although the RYO/MYO cigarette smoking tobacco and related products market had been one of the fastest growing markets in the tobacco industry in the five years prior to 2009, the reauthorization of S-CHIP increased the federal excise tax on RYO tobacco from $1.10 to $24.78 per pound, and materially reduced the MYO cigarette smoking tobacco market in the U.S. There have not been any increases announced since 2009, but we cannot guarantee that we will not be subject to further increases, nor whether any such increases will affect prices in a way that further deters consumers from purchasing our products and/or affects our net revenues in a way that renders us unable to compete effectively.\nIn addition to federal excise taxes, every state and certain city and county governments have imposed substantial excise taxes on sales of tobacco products, and many have raised or proposed to raise excise taxes in recent years. Approximately one-half of the states tax MST on a weight-based versus ad valorem system of taxation. Additional states may consider adopting such revised tax structures as well. Tax increases, depending on their parameters, may result in consumers switching between tobacco products or depress overall tobacco consumption, which is likely to result in declines in overall sales volumes.\nAny future enactment of increases in federal or state excise taxes on our tobacco products or rulings that certain of our products should be categorized differently for excise tax purposes could adversely affect demand for our products and may result in consumers switching between tobacco products or a depression in overall tobacco consumption, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nMany of our NewGen and cigar products have not obtained premarket authorization from the FDA and are currently marketed pursuant to a policy of FDA enforcement discretion, which could change. There could be a material adverse impact on our NewGen business development efforts if the FDA determines that our products are not subject to this compliance policy, of if our products become subject to increased regulatory compliance burdens imposed by the FDA and other regulatory or legislative bodies.\nSince their introduction, there has been significant uncertainty regarding whether, how and when tobacco regulations would apply to NewGen products, such as electronic cigarettes or other vaporizer products. Based on a decision in December 2010 by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit (the \u201cSottera decision\u201d), the FDA is permitted to regulate electronic cigarettes containing tobacco-derived nicotine as \u201ctobacco products\u201d under the Tobacco Control Act.\nEffective August 8, 2016, FDA\u2019s regulatory authority under the Tobacco Control Act was extended to all remaining tobacco products, including: (i) certain NewGen products (such as electronic cigarettes, vaporizers and e-liquids) and their components or parts (such as tanks, coils and batteries); (ii) cigars and their components or parts (such as cigar tobacco); (iii) pipe tobacco; (iv) hookah products; or (v) any other tobacco product \u201cnewly deemed\u201d by FDA. These deeming regulations apply to all products made or derived from tobacco intended for human consumption, but excluding accessories of tobacco products (such as lighters).\nThe deeming regulations require us to (i) register with the FDA and report product and ingredient listings; (ii) market newly deemed products only after FDA review and approval; (iii) only make direct and implied claims of reduced risk if the FDA approves after finding that scientific evidence supports the claim and that marketing the product will benefit public health as a whole; (iv) refrain from distributing free samples; (v) implement minimum age and identification restrictions to prevent sales to individuals under age 18; (vi) develop an approved warning plan and include prescribed health warnings on packaging and advertisements; and (vii) refrain from selling the products in vending machines, unless the machine is located in a facility that never admits youth. Newly deemed tobacco products are also subject to the other requirements of the Tobacco Control Act, such as that they not be adulterated or misbranded. The FDA could in the future promulgate good manufacturing practice regulations for these and our other products, and indeed has indicated it intends to do so, which could have a material adverse impact on our ability and the cost to manufacture our products.\nMarketing authorizations will be necessary in order for us to continue our distribution of certain of our NewGen and cigar products. The FDA has announced various compliance policies whereby it does not intend to prioritize enforcement for lack of premarket authorization against newly-deemed products, provided that such tobacco products were marketed as of August 8, 2016; are not marketed in certain manners likely to be attractive to youth; and for which premarket applications were timely submitted. As a result of recent litigation and subsequent FDA Guidance, marketing applications for newly-deemed products were required to have been submitted no later than September 9, 2020, with the exception of our \u201cgrandfathered\u201d products (products in commerce as of February 15, 2007) which are already authorized. Under the FDA\u2019s compliance policy, such products could remain on the market until September 9, 2021, unless the FDA makes an adverse determination prior to that date. Subsequent to September 9, 2021, the FDA indicated its enforcement priority is those applicants who have received negative action on their application, such as a Marketing Denial Order (\u201cMDO\u201d) or Refuse to File notification and who continue to illegally sell those unauthorized products, as well as products for which manufacturers failed to submit a marketing application.\nIn September 2020, we submitted applications on a timely basis for the appropriate authorizations for our products that are deemed products not otherwise grandfathered. We believe that these products satisfy the criteria for current marketing pursuant to the FDA\u2019s compliance policy. However, there can be no guarantee that the FDA will agree, and the FDA may bring an enforcement action against our products for lack of premarket authorization and/or deny our premarket applications. We have no assurances that the outcome of such application review processes will result in our products receiving marketing authorizations from the FDA. For instance, on September 14, 2021, the FDA issued a marketing denial order (\u201cMDO\u201d) for certain of the Company\u2019s proprietary e-liquid products subject of these PMTAs. The Company filed a Petition for Review in the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals on September 23, 2021, followed by an Emergency Motion for a Stay Pending Review on September 30, 2021. On October 7, 2021, we were informed that the FDA had rescinded its September 14, 2021, MDO. We therefore withdrew both the Petition and Emergency Stay on October 8, 2021. The Rescission Letter indicated that the FDA had found additional relevant information that was not adequately assessed. If the FDA were to issue additional MDOs that remained in effect it could have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe also have certain previously regulated tobacco products which FDA removed from review but remain subject to \u201cprovisional\u201d substantial equivalence submissions made on March 22, 2011; however, FDA has the discretion to reinitiate review of these products. If the FDA establishes regulatory processes that we are unable or unwilling to comply with, our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects could be adversely affected.\nThe anticipated costs of complying with future FDA regulations will be dependent on the rules issued by the FDA, the timing and clarity of any new rules or guidance documents accompanying these rules, the reliability and simplicity (or complexity) of the electronic systems utilized by FDA for information and reports to be submitted, and the details required by FDA for such information and reports with respect to each regulated product. Failure to comply with existing or new FDA regulatory requirements could result in significant financial penalties and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and ability to market and sell our products. Compliance and related costs could be substantial and could significantly increase the costs of operating in our NewGen and cigar product markets.\nIn addition, failure to comply with the Tobacco Control Act and with FDA regulatory requirements could result in litigation, criminal convictions or significant financial penalties and could impair our ability to market and sell certain of our NewGen and cigar products. At present, we are not able to predict whether the Tobacco Control Act will impact our products to a greater degree than competitors in the industry, thus affecting our competitive position.\nFurthermore, in addition to the FDA, there are restrictions being proposed or in effect at the federal, state, and local level related to NewGen products. For example, the PACT Act has now been amended to apply to certain NewGen products, which has impacts at the federal and state levels. These requirements are in addition to any increased regulation of internet sales that may be in effect or passed legislatively at the federal, state, or local levels, or promulgated via rulemaking by a government agency. Additionally, state attorneys general have monitored, and in some cases, have issued investigative requests and/or initiated litigation with regard to companies that sell these products related to online sales, marketing practices, and other aspects of the NewGen business. Increased regulation of additives in tobacco products through federal, state, or local governments may also adversely affect NewGen and cigar products. The application of these types of restrictions, and of any new laws or regulations which may be adopted in the future, to these products could result in additional expenses and require us to change our advertising and labeling, and methods of marketing and distribution of our products, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nSome products we sell are subject to developing and unpredictable regulation.\nSome of the products sold through our NewGen distribution vehicles may be subject to uncertain and evolving federal, state and local regulations concerning hemp, CBD and other non-tobacco consumable products, such as synthetically-derived nicotine, which recently became subject of legislation that would require premarket application filings similar to those required for products currently regulated under the Tobacco Control Act and potentially negatively impact sales of these products in the near future. See \u201cMany of our NewGen and cigar products have not obtained premarket authorization from the FDA and are currently marketed pursuant to a policy of FDA enforcement discretion, which could change. There could be a material adverse impact on our NewGen business development efforts if the FDA determines that our products are not subject to this compliance policy, of if our products become subject to increased regulatory compliance burdens imposed by the FDA and other regulatory or legislative bodies.\u201d Regulatory and related enforcement initiatives by authorities related to such products are unpredictable and impossible to anticipate. We anticipate that all levels of government, that have not already done so, are likely to seek in some way to regulate these products, but the type, timing, and impact of such regulations remains uncertain. These regulations include or could include restrictions prohibiting certain form factors, such as smokable hemp products, or age restrictions. Accordingly, we cannot give any assurance that such actions would not have a material adverse effect on this emerging business and our NewGen strategy.\nFor instance, on October 21, 2021, the USPS published a Final Rule entitled \u201cTreatment of E-Cigarettes in the Mail,\u201d which followed its earlier publication of the Proposed Rule on February 19, 2021. This Final Rule was required as a result of the inclusion of Preventing Online Sales of E-Cigarettes to Children (\u201cPOSECA\u201d) in the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021. POSECA, among other things, expanded the definition of \u201ccigarettes\u201d in the Jenkins Act and PACT Act to expressly capture electronic nicotine delivery systems (\u201cENDS\u201d). Consistent with the Proposed Rule, the Final Rule extends the existing prohibition on and exceptions to the mailing of \u201ccigarettes\u201d via USPS to include ENDS products, other than the Consumer Testing and Public Health exceptions. POSECA\u2019s definition of ENDS also captures non-tobacco products, such as e-liquids that do not contain tobacco-derived nicotine.\nSignificant increases in state and local regulation of our NewGen products have been proposed or enacted and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted in numerous jurisdictions.\nThere has been increasing activity on the state and local levels with respect to scrutiny of NewGen products. State and local governmental bodies across the U.S. have indicated NewGen products may become subject to new laws and regulations at the state and local levels. Further, some states and cities, have enacted regulations that require obtaining a tobacco retail license in order to sell electronic cigarettes and vaporizer products. If one or more states from which we generate or anticipate generating significant sales of NewGen products bring actions to prevent us from selling our NewGen products unless we obtain certain licenses, approvals or permits, and if we are not able to obtain the necessary licenses, approvals or permits for financial reasons or otherwise and/or any such license, approval or permit is determined to be overly burdensome to us, then we may be required to cease sales and distribution of our products to those states, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nCertain states and cities have already restricted the use of electronic cigarettes and vaporizer products in smoke-free venues, imposed excise taxes, or limited sales of flavored NewGen products. Additional city, state or federal regulators, municipalities, local governments and private industry may enact additional rules and regulations restricting electronic cigarettes and vaporizer products. Because of these restrictions, our customers may reduce or otherwise cease using our NewGen products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nCanada and some Canadian provinces have restricted or are contemplating restrictions on the sales and marketing of electronic cigarettes. Furthermore, some Canadian provinces have limited the use of electronic cigarettes and vaporizer products in public places. These measures, and any future measures taken to limit the marketing, sale and use of NewGen products may have a material adverse effect on our sales into Canada.\nIf our NewGen products become subject to increased taxes it could adversely affect our business.\nPresently the federal government and many states do not tax the sale of NewGen products like they do the sale of conventional cigarettes or other tobacco products, all of which generally have high tax rates and have faced significant increases in the amount of taxes collected on their sales. In recent years, however, state and local governments have taken actions to move towards imposing excise taxes on NewGen products. As of December 31, 2021, over half of the states, as well as, certain localities impose excise taxes on electronic cigarettes and/or liquid vapor. These tax structures may benefit one type of NewGen product over another, which may result in consumers switching between NewGen products, other traditional tobacco products, or depress overall consumption in general. Should federal, state and local governments and or other taxing authorities begin or continue to impose excise taxes similar to those levied against conventional cigarettes and tobacco products on NewGen products, it may have a material adverse effect on the demand for these products, as consumers may be unwilling to pay the increased costs, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur supply to our wholesalers and retailers is dependent on the demands of their customers who are sensitive to increased sales taxes and economic conditions affecting their disposable income.\nConsumer purchases of tobacco products are historically affected by economic conditions, such as changes in employment, salary and wage levels, the availability of consumer credit, inflation, interest rates, fuel prices, sales taxes, and the level of consumer confidence in prevailing and future economic conditions. Discretionary consumer purchases, such as of OTP, may decline during recessionary periods or at other times when disposable income is lower, and taxes may be higher.\nIn addition, some states have begun collecting taxes on internet sales where companies have used independent contractors in those states to solicit sales from residents of those states. These taxes apply to our online sales of NewGen products into those states and may result in reduced demand from the independent wholesalers who may not be able to absorb the increased taxes or successfully pass them onto the end-user without experiencing reduced demand. Further, as a result of recent court decisions related to the taxability of internet purchases, states are now able to impose sales tax on internet purchases made from out-of-state sellers, even if the seller does not have a physical presence in the taxing state. Consequently, additional states are likely to seek or have begun to impose sales tax on our online sales. The requirement to collect, track and remit taxes may require us to increase our prices, which may affect demand for our products or conversely reduce our net profit margin, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be subject to increasing international control and regulation.\nThe World Health Organization\u2019s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (\u201cFCTC\u201d) is the first international public health treaty that establishes a global agenda to reduce initiation of tobacco use and regulate tobacco in an effort to encourage tobacco cessation. Over 170 governments worldwide have ratified the FCTC. The FCTC has led to increased efforts to reduce the supply and demand of tobacco products and to encourage governments to further regulate the tobacco industry. The tobacco industry expects significant regulatory developments to take place over the next few years, driven principally by the FCTC. Regulatory initiatives that have been proposed, introduced or enacted include:\n\u2022\nthe levying of substantial and increasing tax and duty charges;\n\u2022\nrestrictions or bans on advertising, marketing and sponsorship;\n\u2022\nthe display of larger health warnings, graphic health warnings and other labeling requirements;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on packaging design, including the use of colors and generic packaging;\n\u2022\nrestrictions or bans on the display of tobacco product packaging at the point of sale, and restrictions or bans on cigarette vending machines;\n\u2022\nrequirements regarding testing, disclosure and performance standards for tar, nicotine, carbon monoxide and other smoke constituents levels;\n\u2022\nrequirements regarding testing, disclosure and use of tobacco product ingredients;\n\u2022\nincreased restrictions on smoking in public and work places and, in some instances, in private places and outdoors;\n\u2022\nelimination of duty-free allowances for travelers; and\n\u2022\nencouraging litigation against tobacco companies.\nIf the U.S. becomes a signatory to the FCTC and/or national laws are enacted in the U.S. that reflect the major elements of the FCTC, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. If NewGen products become subject to one or more of the significant regulatory initiatives proposed under the FCTC, our NewGen products segment may also be materially adversely affected.\nAs part of our strategy, we have begun to expand our business into key international locations, such as introducing our moist snuff tobacco products in South America. International expansion may subject us to additional or increasing international regulation, either by the countries that are the object of the strategic expansion or through international regulatory regimes, such as the FCTC, to which those countries may be signatories.\nTo the extent our existing or future products become subject to international regulatory regimes that we are unable to comply with or fail to comply with, they may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur failure to comply with certain environmental, health and safety regulations could adversely affect our business.\nThe storage, distribution and transportation of some of the products that we sell are subject to a variety of federal and state environmental regulations. In addition, our manufacturing facilities are similarly subject to federal, state and local environmental laws. We are also subject to operational, health and safety laws and regulations. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could cause a disruption in our business, an inability to maintain our manufacturing resources, and additional and potentially significant remedial costs and damages, fines, sanctions or other legal consequences that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nImposition of significant tariffs on imports into the U.S., could have a material and adverse effect on our business.\nWe are required to purchase all our cigarette papers, cigarette tubes and cigarette injector machines under the Distribution Agreements from the supplier in France. Additionally, a substantial portion of our NewGen products are sourced from China. In 2018, President Trump and his administration imposed significant additional tariffs on certain goods imported from outside the U.S., and future administrations could impose additional tariffs in the future. These additional tariffs apply to a significant portion of our NewGen products and may result in increased prices for our customers. These increased prices may reduce demand where customers are unable to absorb the increased prices or successfully pass them onto the end-user. If the U.S. were to impose additional tariffs on goods we import, it is likely to make it more costly for us to import goods from other countries. While the current or future administrations may have a desire to repeal some or all of the tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, no assurance can be given that they will do so. As a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nThe scientific community has not yet studied extensively the long-term health effects of certain substances contained in some of our products.\nElectronic cigarettes, vaporizers and many of our NewGen products were recently developed and therefore the scientific community has not had a sufficient period of time to study the long-term health effects of their use. Currently, there is no way of knowing whether these products are safe for their intended use. If the scientific community were to determine conclusively that use of any or all of these products poses long-term health risks, market demand for these products and their use could materially decline. Such a determination could also lead to litigation and significant regulation. Loss of demand for our product, product liability claims and increased regulation stemming from unfavorable scientific studies on these products could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to significant product liability litigation.\nThe tobacco industry has experienced, and continues to experience, significant product liability litigation. Most tobacco liability lawsuits have been brought against manufacturers and sellers of cigarettes by individual plaintiffs, often participating on a class-action basis, for injuries allegedly caused by cigarette smoking or by exposure to cigarette smoke. However, several lawsuits have also been brought against manufacturers and sellers of smokeless products for injuries to health allegedly caused by use of smokeless products. In addition to the risks to our business, results of operations and financial condition resulting from adverse results in any such action, ongoing litigation may divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which could have an impact on our business and operations. There can be no assurance that we will not sustain losses in connection with such lawsuits and that such losses will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition to current and potential future claims related to our core tobacco products, we are subject to several lawsuits alleging personal injuries resulting from malfunctioning vaporizer devices and may be subject to claims in the future relating to our other NewGen products. We are still evaluating these claims and the potential defenses to them. As a result of their relative novelty, electronic cigarette and vaporizer product manufacturers and sellers have only recently become subject to litigation. We may see increasing litigation over NewGen products or the regulation of our products, as the regulatory regimes surrounding these products develop. For a description of current material litigation to which we or our subsidiaries are a party, see \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings\u201d and \u201cNote 18 - Contingencies\u201d in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for additional information.\nAs a result, we may face substantial costs due to increased product liability litigation relating to new regulations or other potential defects associated with NewGen products we ship, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and related economic repercussions may affect our business.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and related economic repercussions have created significant volatility, uncertainty, and turmoil in the business environment generally. While these events have not yet had a material adverse effect on our business and B2C platforms like ours have seen elevated sales levels from consumer shifts to online purchasing, we can offer no assurance that the COVID-19 pandemic will not have an adverse effect in the future, particularly if the pandemic worsens or endures for an extended period of time.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may adversely impact our financial results. Our third-party cigar wrap manufacturer in the Dominican Republic was temporarily shut down for three months, as a result of government efforts to curb the spread of COVID-19. Since the temporary shutdown, the manufacturer has operated without COVID-19 related interruptions. While our supply chain has not experienced other pandemic related interruptions, we have experienced some increase in costs. We can offer no assurance that the Company will not be adversely affected by the pandemic and related governmental actions in the future, particularly if the COVID-19 pandemic continues and/or other variants emerge. Similarly, because we have more than 100 employees, should the federal government reintroduce testing mandates or other measures to combat COVID-19, our workforce and ultimately our results of operations may be impacted if we have a significant number of employees unwilling to comply with such measures.\nIf the COVID-19 pandemic continues for an extended period of time or worsens, it could have a material adverse effect on our supply chain or workforce, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and liquidity. In addition, if the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues it may heighten other risks that could affect our business.\nRisks Related to Financial Results, Finances and Capital Structure\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness that could affect our financial condition.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $250 million in aggregate principal amount of our 5.625% senior secured notes due 2026 (the \u201cSenior Secured Notes\u201d) outstanding and $172.5 million in aggregate principal amount outstanding under our 2.50% Convertible Senior Notes due July 15, 2024 (the \u201cConvertible Senior Notes\u201d). We also have the ability to borrow up to $25 million under our new revolving credit facility entered into in February 2021 (the \u201cNew Revolving Credit Facility\u201d) under which only letters of credit of $3.6 million were outstanding as of December 31, 2021. If we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt, we may need to further refinance our debt, dispose of assets or issue equity to obtain necessary funds. We do not know whether we will be able to do any of this on a timely basis or on terms satisfactory to us or at all.\nOur substantial amount of indebtedness could limit our ability to:\n\u2022\nobtain necessary additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures or other purposes in the future;\n\u2022\nplan for, or react to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate;\n\u2022\nmake future acquisitions or pursue other business opportunities;\n\u2022\nreact in an extended economic downturn; and\n\u2022\npay dividends.\nThe terms of the agreement governing our indebtedness may restrict our current and future operations, which would adversely affect our ability to respond to changes in our business and to manage our operations.\nThe indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes and our New Revolving Credit Facility each contain, and any future indebtedness of ours would likely contain, a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us, including restrictions on our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur additional debt, disqualified stock and preferred stock;\n\u2022\npay dividends and make other restricted payments;\n\u2022\ncreate liens;\n\u2022\nmake investments and acquisitions;\n\u2022\nengage in sales of assets and subsidiary stock;\n\u2022\nenter into sale-leaseback transactions;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022\ntransfer all or substantially all of our assets or enter into merger or consolidation transactions.\nOur New Revolving Credit Facility also requires us to maintain certain financial ratios under certain limited circumstances. A failure by us to comply with the covenants or financial ratios in our debt instruments could result in an event of default under the facility, which could adversely affect our ability to respond to changes in our business and manage our operations. In the event of any default under our debt instruments, the lenders under the facility could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under such instruments to be due and payable and require us to apply all of our available cash to repay these amounts. If the indebtedness under one of our debt instruments were to be accelerated, it could cause an event of default and/or a cross-acceleration of our obligations under our other debt instruments and there can be no assurance that our assets would be sufficient to repay this indebtedness in full, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur status as an emerging growth company.\nWe ceased to be an emerging growth company on December 31, 2021. As a result, beginning on January 1, 2022 we are required to comply with the disclosure requirements applicable to non-emerging growth companies, including the requirement to obtain an auditor attestation of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (\u201cSection 404\u201d) as well as the requirement to provide enhanced disclosure regarding executive compensation and hold a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation. Compliance with these new disclosure obligations could be costly and will require our management to devote increased effort toward ensuring compliance with the non-emerging growth company requirements. We cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur as a result of the change in our status or the timing of such costs, though such costs may be substantial. In addition, if we are unable to comply with the disclosure requirements applicable to non-EGCs in a timely manner we may be unable to file our current and periodic reports with the SEC on time, which could cause investors to lose confidence in our reports and also affect our ability to quickly access the capital markets.\nIf we fail to establish and maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting, our operating results and our ability to operate our business could be harmed.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires that we establish and maintain internal control over financial reporting, and we are also required to establish disclosure controls and procedures under applicable SEC rules. An effective internal control environment is necessary to enable us to produce reliable financial reports and is an important component of our efforts to prevent and detect financial reporting errors and fraud. Management is required to provide an annual assessment on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and, as a result of ceasing to be an Emerging Growth Company, our independent registered public accounting firm is now also required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Our and our auditor\u2019s testing may reveal deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses and render our internal control over financial reporting ineffective. As noted below, this year\u2019s assessment led management to conclude that a material weakness exists in our information technology control environment. No assurance can be given that we won\u2019t discover additional material weaknesses in the future. We have incurred and we expect to continue to incur substantial accounting and auditing expense and expend significant management time in complying with the requirements of Section 404, including the requirement to have such controls tested by our independent registered public accounting firm. While an effective internal control environment is necessary to enable us to produce reliable financial statements and is an important component of our efforts to prevent and detect financial reporting errors and fraud, disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting are generally not capable of preventing or detecting all financial reporting errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well-designed and operated, is designed to reduce rather than eliminate the risk of material misstatements in our financial statements. There are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of internal controls, including collusion, management override and failure in human judgment. A control system can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and the design of a control system must reflect the fact that resource constraints exist.\nIf we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses:\n\u2022\nour reputation may be adversely affected and our business and operating results could be harmed;\n\u2022\nthe market price of our stock could decline;\n\u2022\nwe could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations; and\n\u2022\nwe could be subject to litigation and/or investigations or sanctions by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d), the New York Stock Exchange or other regulatory authorities.\nWe identified a material weakness in our internal control related to ineffective information technology general controls which, if not remediated appropriately or in a timely manner, could result in loss of investor confidence and adversely impact our stock price.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nIn connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021, during the fourth quarter of 2021, management identified a material weakness in internal control related to ineffective information technology general controls (\u201cITGCs\u201d) in the areas of user access and program change-management over certain information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) systems that support the Company\u2019s financial reporting processes. See Part II, Item 9A for additional information. Internal controls related to the operation of technology systems are critical to maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.\nAs a result, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2021. We are implementing remedial measures and, while there can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful, we plan to remediate the material weakness prior to the end of 2022. These measures will result in additional technology and other expenses. If we are unable to remediate the material weakness, or are otherwise unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures, our ability to record, process and report financial information accurately, and to prepare financial statements within required time periods, could be adversely affected, which could subject us to litigation or investigations requiring management resources and payment of legal and other expenses, negatively affect investor confidence in our financial statements and in turn, adversely impact our stock price.\nChanges in the method of determining the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d), or the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate, may adversely affect interest expense related to outstanding debt.\nAmounts drawn under certain of our debt instruments may bear interest at rates based on LIBOR. On July 27, 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom (the \u201cFCA\u201d) announced that it would phase out LIBOR as a benchmark by the end of 2021. The publication of USD LIBOR will cease after June 30, 2023, and the FCA confirmed that use of USD LIBOR will not be permitted in most new contracts after December 31, 2021. We are currently evaluating the impact of the potential replacement of the LIBOR interest rate. In addition, the overall financial markets may be disrupted as a result of the phase-out or replacement of LIBOR. Uncertainty as to the nature of such potential phase-out and alternative reference rates or disruption in the financial market could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as Delaware law and certain regulations, could discourage or prohibit acquisition bids or merger proposals, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval. If our board of directors elects to issue preferred stock, it could be more difficult for a third party to acquire us. In addition, some provisions of our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and applicable law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the change of control would be beneficial to our stockholders, including:\n\u2022\nlimitations on the removal of directors;\n\u2022\nlimitations on the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings;\n\u2022\nlimitations on stockholder action by written consent;\n\u2022\nestablishing advance notice provisions for stockholder proposals and nominations for elections to the board of directors to be acted upon at meetings of stockholders; and\n\u2022\nlimitations on the ability of our stockholders to fill vacant directorships or amend the number of directors constituting our board of directors.\nOur certificate of incorporation limits the ownership of our common stock by individuals and entities that are Restricted Investors. These restrictions may affect the liquidity of our common stock and may result in Restricted Investors being required to sell or redeem their shares at a loss or relinquish their voting, dividend and distribution rights.\nFor so long as we or one of our subsidiaries is party to any of the Distribution Agreements, our certificate of incorporation will limit the ownership of our common stock by any \u201cRestricted Investor\u201d to 14.9% of our outstanding common stock and shares convertible or exchangeable therefor (including our non-voting common stock) (the \u201cPermitted Percentage\u201d). A \u201cRestricted Investor\u201d is defined as: (i) any entity that directly or indirectly manufactures, sells, markets, distributes or otherwise promotes cigarette paper booklets, filter tubes, injector machines or filter tips in the United States, the District of Columbia, the territories, possessions and military bases of the United States and the Dominion of Canada (a \u201cRTI Competitor\u201d), (ii) any entity that owns more than a 20% equity interest in any RTI Competitor, or (iii) any person who serves as a director or officer of, or any entity that has the right to appoint an officer or director of, any RTI Competitor or of any entity that owns more than a 20% equity interest in any RTI Competitor (each, a \u201cRestricted Investor\u201d). Our certificate of incorporation further provides that any issuance or transfer of shares to a Restricted Investor in excess of the Permitted Percentage will be ineffective as against us and that neither we nor our transfer agent will register the issuance or transfer of shares or be required to recognize the transferee or owner as a holder of our common stock for any purpose except to exercise our remedies described below. Any shares in excess of the Permitted Percentage in the hands of a Restricted Investor will not have any voting or dividend rights and are subject to redemption by us in our discretion. The liquidity or market value of the shares of our common stock may be adversely impacted by such transfer restrictions.\nAs a result of the above provisions, a proposed transferee of our common stock that is a Restricted Investor may not receive any return on its investment in shares it purchases or owns, as the case may be, and it may sustain a loss. We are entitled to redeem all or any portion of such shares acquired by a Restricted Investor in excess of the Permitted Percentage (\u201cExcess Shares\u201d) at a redemption price based on a fair market value formula that is set forth in our certificate of incorporation, which may be paid in any form, including cash or promissory notes, at our discretion. Excess Shares not yet redeemed will not be accorded any voting, dividend or distribution rights while they constitute Excess Shares. As a result of these provisions, a stockholder who is a Restricted Investor may be required to sell its shares of our common stock at an undesirable time or price and may not receive any return on its investment in such shares. However, we may not be able to redeem Excess Shares for cash because our operations may not have generated sufficient excess cash flow to fund the redemption and we may incur additional indebtedness to fund all or a portion of such redemption, in which case our financial condition may be materially weakened.\nOur certificate of incorporation permits us to require that owners of any shares of our common stock provide certification of their status as a Restricted Investor. In the event that a person does not submit such documentation, our certificate of incorporation provides us with certain remedies, including the suspension of the payment of dividends and distributions with respect to shares held by such person and deposit of any such dividends and distributions into an escrow account. As a result of non-compliance with these provisions, an owner of the shares of our common stock may lose significant rights associated with those shares.\nAlthough our certificate of incorporation contains the above provisions intended to assure compliance with the restrictions on ownership of our common stock by Restricted Investors, we may not be successful in monitoring or enforcing the provisions. A failure to enforce or otherwise maintain compliance could lead RTI to exercise its termination rights under the agreements, which would have a material and adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial position and its results of operations.\nIn addition to the risks described above, the foregoing restrictions could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or change in control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or that might otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders.\nFuture sales of our common stock in the public market could reduce our stock price, and any additional capital raised by us through the sale of equity or convertible securities may dilute our stockholders.\nWe may sell additional shares of common stock in public or private offerings and may also sell securities convertible to common stock, such as the Convertible Senior Notes. We may also be required to issue common stock and conversion of our Convertible Senior Notes at the exercise or vesting of certain awards, see Note 13, \u201cNotes Payable and Long-Term Debt,\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for further discussion..\nWe cannot predict the size of future issuances of our common stock or securities convertible into common stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of shares of our common stock will have on the market price of our common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock (including shares issued in connection with an acquisition), or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock.\nWe may issue preferred stock whose terms could adversely affect the voting power or value of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designations, preferences, limitations and relative rights, including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our board of directors may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could adversely impact the voting power or value of our common stock. For example, we might grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we might assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock.\nGeneral Risks\nOur business may be damaged by events outside of our or our suppliers\u2019 control, such as the impact of epidemics (e.g., coronavirus), political upheavals, or natural disasters.\nWe have manufacturing operations in Tennessee and Kentucky. Additionally, we have critical suppliers of raw materials and finished products in other countries. Events may impact our ability to manufacture products or prevent critical suppliers from performing their obligations to us, through no fault of any party. Examples of such events could include the effect of potential epidemics, such as COVID-19; political upheavals including violent changes in government, regional conflicts and the reaction of the governments throughout the world to those conflicts such as the implementation of sanctions, widespread labor unrest, or breakdowns in civil order; and natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tornados, earthquakes or floods. If such events were to occur and disrupt our manufacturing capabilities or supply arrangements, there can be no assurance that we could quickly remedy the impact and there could be a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nReliance on information technology means a significant disruption could affect our communications and operations.\nWe increasingly rely on information technology systems for our internal communications, controls, reporting and relations with customers and suppliers and information technology is becoming a significantly important tool for our sales staff. Our marketing and distribution strategy are dependent upon our ability to closely monitor consumer and market trends on a highly specified level, for which we are reliant on our highly sophisticated data tracking systems, which are susceptible to disruption or failure. In addition, our reliance on information technology exposes us to cyber-security risks, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete. Security and privacy breaches may expose us to liability and cause us to lose customers or may disrupt our relationships and ongoing transactions with other entities with whom we contract throughout our supply chain. The failure of our information systems to function as intended, or the penetration by outside parties\u2019 intent on disrupting business processes, could result in significant costs, loss of revenue, assets or personal or other sensitive data and reputational harm.\nAdditionally, in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021, during the fourth quarter of 2021, management identified a material weakness in internal control related to ineffective ITGCs in the areas of user access and program change-management over certain IT systems that support the Company\u2019s financial reporting processes. See Part II, Item 9A for additional information. In the event we are unable to remediate the material weakness, or are otherwise unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures, our ability to record, process and report financial information accurately, and to prepare financial statements within required time periods, could be adversely affected, which could subject us to litigation or investigations requiring management resources and payment of legal and other expenses, negatively affect investor confidence in our financial statements and, in turn, adversely impact our stock price.\nSecurity and privacy breaches may expose us to liability and cause us to lose customers.\nFederal and state laws require us to safeguard our wholesalers\u2019, retailers\u2019 and consumers\u2019 financial information, including credit information. Although we have established security procedures to protect against identity theft and the theft of our customers\u2019 financial information, our security and testing measures may not prevent security breaches. We have been in the past and may again in the future be subject to cyberattacks, including attacks that have resulted in the theft of customer financial information, such as credit card information; however, no cyberattack we have suffered to date has resulted in material liability to us. These attacks have become increasingly sophisticated over time and maybe conducted or \u201csponsored\u201d by nation states with significant resources. We cannot guarantee that a future breach would not result in material liability or otherwise harm our business. In the event of any such breach, we may be required to notify governmental authorities or consumers under breach disclosure laws, indemnify consumers or other third parties for losses resulting from the breach, and expend resources investigating and remediating any vulnerabilities that contributed to the occurrence of the breach. Typically, we rely on encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties to enhance transmission security of confidential information in relation to financial and other sensitive information that we have on file. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography, inadequate facility security or other developments may result in a compromise or breach of the technology used by us to protect customer data. Any compromise of our security, even a security breach that does not result in a material liability, could harm our reputation and therefore, our business and financial condition. In addition, a party who is able to circumvent our security measures or exploit inadequacies in our security measures, could, among other effects, misappropriate proprietary information (including trade secrets), cause interruptions in our operations or expose customers and other entities with which we interact to computer viruses or other disruptions. Actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us. While we maintain cyber errors and omissions insurance that covers certain cyber risks, our insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all claims or losses. To the extent the measures we have taken prove to be insufficient or inadequate, we may become subject to litigation or administrative sanctions, which could result in significant fines, penalties or damages and harm to our reputation.\nWe may fail to manage our growth.\nWe have expanded over our history and intend to grow in the future. We acquired the Stoker\u2019s\u00ae brand in 2003 and have continued to develop it through the introduction of new products, such as moist snuff. Our acquisition of the Vapor Beast\u00ae brand in 2016 accelerated our entry into non-traditional retail channels while the 2018 acquisition of IVG added a top B2C platform which enhances our marketing and selling of proprietary and third-party vapor products to adult consumers. More recently, the acquisition of Solace provided us with a leading line of e-liquids and a powerful new product development platform, the acquisition of certain tobacco assets and distribution rights from Durfort and BluntWrap USA secured long-term control of our Zig-Zag MYO cigar wrap products and provided us access to a portfolio of tobacco products with significant strategic value, and the acquisition of certain tobacco assets from Unitabac expanded our capabilities in the growing cigar market. However, any future growth will place additional demands on our resources, and we cannot be sure we will be able to manage our growth effectively. If we are unable to manage our growth while maintaining the quality of our products and profit margins, or if new systems that we implement to assist in managing our growth do not produce the expected benefits, our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. We may not be able to support, financially or otherwise, future growth, or hire, train, motivate and manage the required personnel. Our failure to manage growth effectively could also limit our ability to achieve our goals as they relate to streamlined sales, marketing and distribution operations and the ability to achieve certain financial metrics.\nWe may fail to successfully integrate our acquisitions or otherwise be unable to benefit from pursuing acquisitions.\nWe believe there are meaningful opportunities to grow through acquisitions and joint ventures across all OTP and adjacent product categories and we expect to continue a strategy of selectively identifying and acquiring businesses with complementary products. We may be unable to identify, negotiate, and complete suitable acquisition opportunities on reasonable terms. There can be no assurance that any business acquired by us will be successfully integrated with our operations or prove to be profitable to us. We may incur future liabilities related to acquisitions. Should any of the following problems, or others, occur as a result of our acquisition strategy, the impact could be material:\n\u2022\ndifficulties integrating personnel from acquired entities and other corporate cultures into our business;\n\u2022\ndifficulties integrating information systems;\n\u2022\nthe potential loss of key employees of acquired companies;\n\u2022\nthe assumption of liabilities and exposure to undisclosed or unknown liabilities of acquired companies; or\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management attention from existing operations\nWe are subject to fluctuations in our results that make it difficult to track trends and develop strategies in the short-term.\nIn response to competitor actions and pricing pressures, we have engaged in significant use of promotional and sales incentives. We regularly review the results of our promotional spending activities and adjust our promotional spending programs in an effort to maintain our competitive position. Accordingly, unit sales volume and sales promotion costs in any period are not necessarily indicative of sales and costs that may be realized in subsequent periods. Additionally, promotional activity significantly increases net sales in the month in which it is initiated, and net sales are adversely impacted in the month after a promotion. Accordingly, based upon the timing of our marketing and promotional initiatives, we have and may continue to experience significant variability in our results, which could affect our ability to formulate strategies that allow us to maintain our market presence across volatile periods. If our fluctuations obscure our ability to track important trends in our key markets, it may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to the risks of exchange rate fluctuations.\nCurrency movements and suppliers\u2019 price increases relating to premium cigarette papers and cigarette tubes are the primary factors affecting our cost of sales. These products are purchased under the Distribution Agreements and the License Agreements, and we make payments in euros. Thus, we bear certain foreign exchange rate risk for certain of our inventory purchases. In addition, as part of our strategy, we have begun strategic international expansions. As a result, we may be more sensitive to the risks of exchange rate fluctuations. To manage this risk, we sometimes utilize short-term forward currency contracts to purchase euros for our inventory purchases. We have a foreign exchange currency policy which governs our hedging of risk. While we engage in hedging transactions from time to time, no assurance can be made that we will be successful in eliminating currency exchange risks or that changes in currency rates will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAdverse U.S. and global economic conditions could negatively impact our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nOur business and operations are sensitive to global economic conditions. These conditions include interest rates, energy costs, inflation, recession, fluctuations in debt and equity capital markets and the general condition of the U.S. and world economy, including as a result of the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic. A material decline in the economic conditions affecting consumers, which cause a reduction in disposable income for the average consumer, may change consumption patterns, and may result in a reduction in spending on OTP or a switch to cheaper products or products obtained through illicit channels. Material inflation may also lead to significant increases in property, E&O and other insurance premiums which could affect our results of operations and liquidity and may also result in us self-insuring if the premiums become uneconomical. Electronic cigarettes, vaporizer, e-liquid, and other NewGen products are relatively new to market and may be regarded by users as a novelty item and expendable. As such, demand for our NewGen products may be particularly sensitive to economic conditions such as inflation, recession, high energy costs, unemployment, changes in interest rates and money supply, changes in the political environment, the ultimate effect on the economy of the COVID-19 pandemic and other factors beyond our control, any combination of which could result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe departure of key management personnel and the failure to attract and retain talent could adversely affect our operations.\nOur success depends upon the continued contributions of our senior management. Our ability to implement our strategy of attracting and retaining the best talent may be impaired by the decreasing social acceptance of tobacco usage. The tobacco industry competes for talent with the consumer products industry and other companies that enjoy greater societal acceptance. As a result, we may be unable to attract and retain the best talent, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur intellectual property rights may be infringed or misappropriated.\nWe currently rely on trademark and other intellectual property rights to establish and protect our products, including the brand names and logos we own or license. Third parties have in the past infringed on and misappropriated and may in the future infringe or misappropriate, these trademarks and our other intellectual property rights. Our ability to maintain and further build brand recognition is dependent on the continued and exclusive use of these trademarks, service marks and other proprietary intellectual property rights, including the names and logos we own or license. Despite our attempts to ensure these intellectual property rights are protected, third parties may take actions that could materially and adversely affect our rights or the value of this intellectual property. Any enforcement concerning our intellectual property rights, whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in substantial costs to us and diversions of our resources. Expenses related to protecting and enforcing our intellectual property rights, the loss or compromise of any of these rights or the loss of revenues as a result of infringement or misappropriation could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition, and may prevent the brands we own or license from growing or maintaining market share.\nThird parties may claim that we infringe or misappropriate their intellectual property rights.\nCompetitors in the tobacco products and NewGen markets may claim that we infringe on or misappropriate their intellectual property rights. Such claims, whether or not meritorious, may result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources, injunctions against us and/or the payment of damages. Further, our vapor distribution businesses distribute third party product brands with those suppliers\u2019 branding and imagery. If that branding or imagery is alleged by other parties to infringe or otherwise violate intellectual property rights, we could be drawn into such litigation.\nWe may fail to meet expectations relating to environmental, social and governance factors.\nMarket participants, including investors, analysts, customers and other key stakeholders are increasingly focused on environmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) factors. We have recently determined to adopt a more comprehensive ESG initiative with an initial focus on public health and began to roll-out this new initiative in 2020. However, the ESG factors by which companies\u2019 corporate responsibility practices are assessed differ among market participants, are constantly evolving and could result in greater expectations of us and/or cause us to undertake costly initiatives to satisfy such new criteria. We risk damage to our brand and reputation in the event that our corporate responsibility procedures or standards do not meet the standards expected by us. Furthermore, we could fail, or be perceived to fail, in our achievement of our publicly disclosed ESG initiatives or goals and we could also be criticized for the scope of such initiatives or goals. If we fail to satisfy the expectations of investors and other key stakeholders or our initiatives are not executed as planned, our reputation and financial results could be materially and adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 16083, "SIC": 2100, "TIC": "TPB"}
