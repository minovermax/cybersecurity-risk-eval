RISK FACTORS\nOur business involves a number of risks, some of which are beyond our control. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Such factors could have a significant impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. We believe the most significant of these risks and uncertainties are as follows:\nOur independent registered public accounting firm\u2019s report contains an explanatory paragraph that expresses substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a \u201cgoing concern\u201d Our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report have been prepared on the basis that we will continue to operate as a going concern. Accordingly, assets and liabilities are recorded on the basis that we will be able to realize our assets and discharge our liabilities in the normal course of business. Our history of operating losses, declining current ratio and stockholders\u2019 deficit may, by themselves, cause uncertainty about our ability to continue to operate our business as a going concern. Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements describes the actions we have taken and could take to improve our liquidity.\nOur business plans and our assumptions around the adequacy of our liquidity are based on estimates regarding expected revenues and future costs and our ability to secure additional sources of funding if needed. However, our revenue may not meet our expectations or our costs may exceed our estimates. Further, our estimates may change and future events or developments may also affect our estimates. Any of these factors may change our expectation of cash usage in 2016 or significantly affect our level of liquidity, which may require us to seek additional financing or take other measures to reduce our operating costs or obtain funding in order to continue operating. Any action to reduce operating costs may negatively affect our range of products and services that we offer or our ability to deliver such products and services, which could materially impact our financial results depending on the level of cost reductions taken. We are seeking additional funding to support ongoing operations. We have no arrangement or commitments for any financing, and financing may not be available when needed on terms favorable to us, or at all.\nIn its audit report on our financial statements, our independent registered public accounting firm noted that we have suffered recurring losses, have a net working capital deficiency, and a deficiency of stockholders\u2019 equity. As a result of these conditions, the audit report contains an explanatory paragraph that raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur inability to maintain sufficient availability under our revolving credit facility or sufficient access to capital markets to replace that facility when it matures would have a significant impact on our business. We currently maintain a revolving credit facility with Bridge Bank, National Association that expires in May 2016. Borrowings under this facility are collateralized by substantially all of our assets. The amount of available borrowings fluctuates based on the underlying asset-borrowing base, which is 80% of our eligible trade accounts receivable. At December 31, 2015 we had $2.16 million outstanding under this facility. In addition to cash on hand, cash flow from operations and our vendor financing facility, this bank facility provides us with the liquidity we require to meet our operating, investing and financing needs. The failure to replace the existing credit facility upon its maturity with a comparable credit facility that provides similar amounts of liquidity for the Company would have a material negative impact on our overall liquidity, financial and operating results.\nWe may not have sufficient financial resources to carry out our strategy; we may need to issue debt or use our stock to seek additional funding. We may not have sufficient financial resources to carry out our strategy. As described above, we may need to secure additional capital in the future to improve our liquidity in order to carry out our business plan. The amounts involved in any such transaction, individually or in the aggregate, may be material. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities, the issuance of such securities could result in dilution to our existing stockholders. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities, the terms of such debt could impose additional restrictions on our operations. Additional capital, if required, may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. A failure to obtain additional financing could have a material adverse impact our business, financial condition and earnings.\nWe incurred a net loss in 2015 and 2014 and we may experience net losses in the future. We experienced net losses of $2.2 million and $2.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Although we have had multiple profitable quarters in the last two years including most recently in the fourth quarter of 2015, we have had a history of fluctuating operating results, including a history of annual net losses from inception through 2009 and from 2012 through 2015. Although we have made efforts to align costs with sales and gross margin volume, there can be no guarantee that we will be successful in sustaining or increasing profitability in 2016 or beyond. The uncertainty of a rapidly changing competitive marketplace has created a volatile and challenging business climate, which may continue to negatively impact our customers and their spending and investment decisions. We may not be able to generate the level of revenue necessary to achieve and maintain sustainable profitability, particularly as we continue to incur significant sales and marketing and administrative expenses. Any failure to maintain and grow our revenue volumes would adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe have substantial amounts of goodwill and other intangibles, and changes in future business conditions could cause these assets to become impaired, requiring substantial write-downs that would adversely affect our operating results. We have substantial amounts of goodwill and other intangibles resulting from prior acquisitions of businesses, including the acquisition of the systems integration business from arvato digital services, LLC in 2013. Under generally accepted accounting principles, we do not amortize goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination that are determined to have indefinite useful lives, but instead review them annually (or more frequently if impairment indicators arise) for impairment. We are amortizing certain other intangibles over their useful lives. To the extent we determine that such assets have been impaired, we will write-down their carrying value on our consolidated balance sheet and book an impairment charge in our consolidated statement of operations. During each of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we conducted such analyses that resulted in no impairment. The net carrying value of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangibles totaled $1.9 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The net carrying value of finite lived intangible assets totaled $0.8 million and $1.0 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of customers. We derive and believe that we will continue to derive in the near term a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of customers. To the extent that any significant customer uses less of our services or terminates its relationship with us, our revenues could decline significantly, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Three customers comprised 65% and 60% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nMost of our contracts may be canceled on short notice, so our revenue and potential profits are not guaranteed. Most of our contracts are cancelable on short notice by the customer either at its convenience or upon our default. If one of our customers terminates a contract at its convenience, then we typically are able to recover only costs incurred or committed, settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to termination, which could prevent us from recognizing all of our potential revenue and profit from that contract. If one of our customers terminates the contract due to our default, we could be liable for excess costs incurred by the customer in re-procuring services from another source, as well as other costs. Many of our contracts, including our service agreements, are periodically open to bid. We may not be the successful bidder on our existing contracts that are re-bid. We also provide a portion of our services on a non-recurring, project-by-project basis. We could experience a reduction in our revenue, profitability and liquidity if our customers cancel a significant number of contracts, we fail to win a significant number of our existing contracts upon re-bid or we complete the required work under a significant number of our non-recurring projects and cannot replace them with similar projects. In addition, we provide services under certain master service agreements. If these agreements are terminated, we would be unable to provide on-going services to those customers.\nA significant portion of our projects are accounted for on the percentage-of-completion method, and if actual results vary from the assumptions made in estimating percentage-of-completion, our revenue and income could be reduced. We generally recognize revenue for a significant portion of our projects using the percentage-of-completion method. Under the percentage-of-completion method, we record revenue as work on the contract progresses. The cumulative amount of revenue recorded on a contract at a specified point in time is equal to that percentage of total revenue that incurred costs to date bear to the estimated total expected contract costs. The percentage-of-completion method therefore relies on accurate estimates of total expected contract costs. Contract revenue and total cost estimates are reviewed and revised periodically as the work progresses. Adjustments are reflected in contract revenue in the fiscal period when such estimates are revised. Estimates are based on management\u2019s reasonable assumptions and experience, but are only estimates. Variation between actual results and estimates on a large project or on a number of smaller projects could be material. We immediately recognize the full amount of the estimated loss on a contract when our estimates indicate such a loss. Any such loss would reduce our revenue and income.\nWe submit change orders to our customers for work we perform beyond the scope of some of our contracts. If our customers do not approve these change orders, our results of operations could be adversely impacted. We typically submit change orders under some of our contracts for payment of work performed beyond the initial contractual requirements. The applicable customers may not approve or may contest these change orders and we cannot assure you that these claims will be approved in whole, in part or at all. If these claims are not approved, our net income and results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nWe may not accurately estimate the costs associated with services provided under fixed-price contracts, which could impair our financial performance. Approximately 85% of our revenue is derived from fixed price contracts. Under these contracts, we set the price of our services and assume the risk that the costs associated with our performance may be greater than we anticipated. Our profitability is therefore dependent upon our ability to estimate accurately the costs associated with our services. These costs may be affected by a variety of factors, such as lower than anticipated productivity, conditions at the work sites differing materially from what was anticipated at the time we bid on the contract, and higher than expected costs of materials and labor. Certain agreements or projects could have lower margins than anticipated or losses if actual costs for contracts exceed our estimates, which could reduce our profitability and liquidity.\nFailure to properly manage projects may result in costs or claims. Our engagements often involve relatively large scale, highly complex projects. The quality of our performance on such projects depends in large part upon our ability to manage the customer relationship, to manage effectively the project and to deploy appropriate resources, including third-party contractors and our own personnel, in a timely manner. Any defects, errors or failure to meet customers\u2019 expectations could result in claims for substantial damages against us. We currently maintain comprehensive general liability, umbrella, and professional liability insurance policies. We cannot be certain that the insurance coverage we carry to cover such claims will be adequate to protect us from the full impact of such claims. Moreover, in certain instances, we guarantee customers that we will complete a project by a scheduled date or that the project will achieve certain performance standards. If the project experiences a performance problem, we may not be able to recover the additional costs we will incur, which could exceed revenues realized from a project. Finally, if we underestimate the resources or time we need to complete a project with capped or fixed fees, our operating results could be seriously harmed.\nWe may choose, or be required, to pay our subcontractors even if our customers do not pay or delay paying us for the related services. We use subcontractors to perform portions of our services and to manage work flow. In some cases, we pay our subcontractors before our customers pay us for the related services. If we choose, or are required, to pay our subcontractors for work performed for customers who fail to pay, or delay paying us for the related work, we could experience a decrease in profitability and liquidity.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry, which could reduce our growth opportunities, revenue and operating results. The mission-critical information technology industry in which we operate is highly competitive and continues to become more competitive. We often compete against divisions of large design build construction and real estate firms and other information technology consulting and integration companies, including several that are large domestic companies that may have financial, technical and marketing resources that exceed our own. These larger competitors have an infrastructure and support greater than ours, and accordingly, we continue to experience some price pressure as some companies are willing to take on projects at lower margins. Our competitors may develop the expertise, experience and resources to provide services that are equal or superior in both price and quality to our services, and we may not be able to maintain or enhance our competitive position. Our size often prevents us from bidding on larger, more profitable projects, which significantly reduces our growth opportunities. Although our customers currently outsource a significant portion of these services to us and our competitors, we can offer no assurance that our existing or prospective customers will continue to outsource specialty contracting services to us in the future.\nThe industries we serve have experienced and may continue to experience rapid technological, structural and competitive changes that could reduce the need for our services and adversely affect our revenues. The mission-critical information technology industry is characterized by rapid technological change, intense competition and changing consumer and data center needs. We generate a significant portion of our revenues from customers in the mission-critical information technology industry. New technologies, or upgrades to existing technologies by customers, could reduce the need for our services and adversely affect our revenues and profitability. Improvements in existing technology may allow companies to improve their networks without physically upgrading them. Reduced demand for our services or a loss of a significant customer could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nWe may be unable to obtain sufficient bonding capacity to support certain service offerings. Some of our contracts, particularly with managing construction related-activities, require performance and payment bonds. Bonding capacity for construction projects has become increasingly difficult to obtain, and bonding companies are denying or restricting coverage to an increasing number of contractors. Companies that have been successful in renewing or obtaining coverage have sometimes been required to post additional collateral to secure the same amount of bonds which would reduce availability under any credit facility. We may not be able to maintain a sufficient level of bonding capacity in the future, which could preclude us from being able to bid for certain contracts and successfully contract with certain customers. In addition, even if we are able to successfully renew or obtain performance or payment bonds in the future, we may be required to post letters of credit in connection with the bonds. At December 31, 2015, we had approximately $7.3 million in outstanding bonds associated with ongoing projects.\nWe may be unable to hire and retain sufficient qualified personnel and the loss of any of our key executive officers may adversely affect our business. We believe that our future success will depend in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled, knowledgeable, sophisticated and qualified managerial, professional and technical personnel. Our business involves the development of tailored solutions for customers, a process that relies heavily upon the expertise and services of employees. Accordingly, our employees are one of our most valuable resources. Competition for skilled personnel is intense in our industry. Recruiting and training these personnel require substantial resources. Our failure to attract and retain qualified personnel could increase our costs of performing our contractual obligations, reduce our ability to efficiently satisfy our customers\u2019 needs, limit our ability to win new business and constrain our future growth.\nIf we are unable to engage appropriate subcontractors or if our subcontractors fail to perform their contractual obligations, our performance as a prime contractor and ability to obtain future business could be materially and adversely impacted. Our contract performance may involve subcontracts with other companies upon which we rely to perform all or a portion of the work we are obligated to deliver to our customers. Our inability to find and engage\nappropriate subcontractors or a failure by one or more of our subcontractors to satisfactorily deliver on a timely basis the agreed-upon supplies and/or perform the agreed-upon services may materially and adversely affect our ability to perform our obligations as a prime contractor.\nIn extreme cases, a subcontractor\u2019s performance deficiency could result in the customer terminating the contract for default with us. A default termination could expose us to liability for excess costs of procurement by the customer and have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and task orders.\nBecause we do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock, stockholders will benefit from an investment in our common stock only if it appreciates in value. We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain all future earnings, if any, for use in the operations and expansion of our business. As a result, we do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any future determination as to the declaration and payment of cash dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on factors our board of directors deems relevant, including, among others, our results of operations, financial condition and cash requirements, business prospects, and the terms of our credit facility and other financing arrangements. Accordingly, realization of a gain on stockholders\u2019 investments will depend on the appreciation of the price of our common stock. There is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which stockholders purchased their shares.\nOur insiders beneficially own a significant portion of our outstanding common stock. Future sales of common stock by these insiders may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. Our officers, directors or their affiliates beneficially own approximately 5.8 million shares of common stock or approximately 34% of our outstanding common shares as of March 30, 2016. Stock sales by our directors and officers are subject to compliance with our Code of Conduct and preapproval process from the Chief Financial Officer. Sales of a substantial number of these shares in the public market could decrease the market price of our common stock. In addition, the perception that such sales might occur may cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Future issuances or sales of our common stock could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nOur shares are thinly traded and may not be readily marketable. Our shares are not widely traded, and daily trading volume is generally very low compared with most publicly traded companies. As a result, you may not be able to readily resell your shares in the company.\nOur common stock may be characterized as a \u201cpenny stock\u201d under applicable SEC regulations. Our common stock may be characterized as \u201cpenny stock\u201d under SEC regulations. As such, broker-dealers dealing in our common stock may be subject to the disclosure rules for transactions involving penny stocks, which generally require that, prior to a purchase, the broker-dealer determine if purchasing the common stock is suitable for the applicable purchaser. The broker-dealer must also obtain the written consent of the applicable purchasers to purchase the common stock and disclose the best bid and offer prices available for the common stock and the price at which the broker-dealer last purchased or sold the common stock. These additional burdens imposed upon broker-dealers may discourage them from effecting transactions in our common stock, which could make it difficult for an investor to sell his, her or its shares at any given time.", "PERMNO": 92218, "SIC": 8741, "TIC": "TSSI"}
