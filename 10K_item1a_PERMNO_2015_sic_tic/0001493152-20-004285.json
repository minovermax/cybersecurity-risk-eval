{"cik": "1106838", "company": "Chanticleer Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-19", "item_1A": "Item 1A: Risk Factors\nInvesting in our common stock involves risks. Prospective investors in our common stock should carefully consider, among other things, the following risk factors in connection with the other information and financial statements contained in this Report. We have identified the following factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements we may make from time to time.\nWe operate in a continually changing business environment in which new risk factors emerge from time to time. We can neither predict these new risk factors, nor can we assess the impact, if any, of these new risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. If any of these risks, or combination of risks, actually occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be seriously and materially harmed, and the trading price of our common stock could decline. All forward-looking statements in this document are based on information available to us as of the date hereof, and we assume no obligations to update any such forward-looking statements.\nRisks Related to Our Company and Industry\nWe have not been profitable to date and operating losses could continue.\nWe have incurred operating losses and generated negative cash flows since our inception and have financed our operations principally through equity investments and borrowings. Future profitability is difficult to predict with certainty. Failure to achieve profitability could materially and adversely affect the value of our Company and our ability to effect additional financings. The success of the business depends on our ability to increase revenues to offset expenses. If our revenues fall short of projections or we are unable to reduce operating expenses, our business, financial condition and operating results will be materially adversely affected.\nOur financial statements have been prepared assuming a going concern.\nOur financial statements as of December 31, 2019 were prepared under the assumption that we will continue as a going concern for the next twelve months from the date of issuance of these financial statements. Our independent registered public accounting firm has issued a report that includes an explanatory paragraph referring to our losses from operations and expressing substantial doubt in our ability to continue as a going concern without additional capital becoming available. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to obtain additional financing, re-negotiate or extend existing indebtedness, obtain further operating efficiencies, reduce expenditures and ultimately, create profitable operations. We may not be able to refinance or extend our debt or obtain additional capital on reasonable terms. Our financial statements do not include adjustments that would result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nAny prior acquisitions, as well as future acquisitions, may have unanticipated consequences that could harm our business and our financial condition.\nAny acquisition that we pursue, whether successfully completed or not, involves risks, including:\n\u25cf material adverse effects on our operating results, particularly in the fiscal quarters immediately following the acquisition as the acquired restaurants are integrated into our operations;\n\u25cf risks associated with entering into markets or conducting operations where we have no or limited prior experience;\n\u25cf problems retaining key personnel;\n\u25cf potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets and goodwill acquired in the acquisition;\n\u25cf potential unknown liabilities;\n\u25cf difficulties of integration and failure to realize anticipated synergies; and\n\u25cf disruption of our ongoing business, including diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns.\nFuture acquisitions of restaurants or other businesses, which may be accomplished through a cash purchase transaction, the issuance of our equity securities or a combination of both, could result in potentially dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and impairment charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets, any of which could harm our business and financial condition.\nThere are risks inherent in expansion of operations, including our ability to generate profits from new restaurants, find suitable sites and develop and construct locations in a timely and cost-effective way.\nWe cannot project with certainty the number of new restaurants we and our franchisees will open. Our failure to effectively develop locations in new territories would adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan by, among other things, reducing our revenues and profits and preventing us from realizing our strategy. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that our new restaurants will generate revenues or profit margins consistent with those currently operated by us.\nThe number of openings and the performance of new locations will depend on various factors, including:\n\u25cf the availability of suitable sites for new locations;\n\u25cf our ability to negotiate acceptable lease or purchase terms for new locations, obtain adequate financing, on favorable terms, required to construct, build-out and operate new locations and meet construction schedules, and hire and train and retain qualified restaurant managers and personnel;\n\u25cf managing construction and development costs of new restaurants at affordable levels;\n\u25cf the establishment of brand awareness in new markets; and\n\u25cf the ability of our Company to manage expansion.\nAdditionally, competition for suitable restaurant sites in target markets is intense. Restaurants we open in new markets may take longer to reach expected sales and profit levels on a consistent basis and may have higher construction, occupancy or operating costs than restaurants we open in existing markets, thereby affecting our overall profitability.\nNew markets may have competitive conditions, consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns that are more difficult to predict or satisfy than our existing markets. We may need to make greater investments than we originally planned in advertising and promotional activity in new markets to build brand awareness. We may find it more difficult in new markets to hire, motivate and keep qualified employees who share our vision, passion and culture. We may also incur higher costs from entering new markets if, for example, we assign regional managers to manage comparatively fewer restaurants than in more developed markets.\nWe may not be able to successfully develop critical market presence for our brand in new geographical markets, as we may be unable to find and secure attractive locations, build name recognition or attract new customers. Inability to fully implement or failure to successfully execute our plans to enter new markets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nNot all of these factors are within our control or the control of our partners, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to accelerate our growth or that we will be able to manage the anticipated expansion of our operations effectively.\nWe have debt financing arrangements that could have a material adverse effect on our financial health and our ability to obtain financing in the future and may impair our ability to react quickly to changes in our business.\nOur exposure to debt financing could limit our ability to satisfy our obligations, limit our ability to operate our business and impair our competitive position. For example, it could:\n\u25cf increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions, including interest rate fluctuations, because a portion of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest;\n\u25cf require us to dedicate significant future cash flows to the repayment of debt, reducing the availability of cash to fund working capital, capital expenditures or other general corporate purposes;\n\u25cf limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry; and\n\u25cf limit our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing due to applicable financial and restrictive covenants contained in our debt agreements.\nWe may also incur additional indebtedness in the future, which could materially increase the impact of these risks on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to refinance our current debt obligations. Failure to successfully recapitalize the business could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nVarious subsidiaries of the Company are delinquent in payment of payroll taxes to taxing authorities prior to the current year when previous management was in place, and a failure to remit these payments promptly or through settlements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2019, approximately $2.9 million of employee and employer taxes (including estimated penalties and interest) has been accrued but not remitted in years prior to 2019 to certain taxing authorities by certain subsidiaries of the Company for cash compensation paid. As a result, these subsidiaries of the Company are liable for such payroll taxes. These various subsidiaries of the Company have received warnings and demands from the taxing authorities and management is prioritizing and working with the taxing authorities to make these payments in order to avoid further penalties and interest. Failure to remit these payments promptly could result in increased penalty fees and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLitigation and unfavorable publicity could negatively affect our results of operations as well as our future business.\nWe are subject to potential for litigation and other customer complaints concerning our food safety, service and/or other operational factors. Guests may file formal litigation complaints that we are required to defend, whether we believe them to be true or not. Substantial, complex or extended litigation could have an adverse effect on our results of operations if we incur substantial defense costs and our management is distracted. Employees may also, from time to time, bring lawsuits against us regarding injury, discrimination, wage and hour, and other employment issues. Additionally, potential disputes could subject us to litigation alleging non-compliance with franchise, development, support service, or other agreements. Additionally, we are subject to the risk of litigation by our stockholders as a result of factors including, but not limited to, performance of our stock price.\nIn certain states we are subject to \u201cdram shop\u201d statutes, which generally allow a person injured by an intoxicated person the right to recover damages from an establishment that wrongfully served alcoholic beverages to the intoxicated person. Some dram shop litigation against restaurant companies has resulted in significant judgments, including punitive damages. We carry liquor liability coverage as part of our existing comprehensive general liability insurance, but we cannot provide assurance that this insurance will be adequate in the event we are found liable in a dram shop case.\nIn recent years there has been an increase in the use of social media platforms and similar devices that allow individuals\u2019 access to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons. The availability of information on social media platforms is virtually immediate in its impact. A variety of risks are associated with the use of social media, including the improper disclosure of proprietary information, negative comments about our Company, exposure of personally identifiable information, fraud or outdated information. The inappropriate use of social media platforms by our guests, employees or other individuals could increase our costs, lead to litigation, or result in negative publicity that could damage our reputation, and create an adverse change in the business climate that impairs goodwill. If we are unable to quickly and effectively respond, we may suffer declines in guest traffic, which could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nFood safety and foodborne illness concerns could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe cannot guarantee that our internal control and training will be fully effective in preventing all food safety issues at our restaurants, including any occurrences of foodborne illnesses such as salmonella, E. coli and hepatitis A. In addition, there is no guarantee that our franchise restaurants will maintain the high levels of internal controls and training we require at our company-operated restaurants.\nFurthermore, we and our franchisees rely on third-party vendors, making it difficult to monitor food safety compliance and increasing the risk that foodborne illness would affect multiple locations rather than a single restaurant. Some foodborne illness incidents could be caused by third-party vendors and transporters outside of our control. New illnesses resistant to our current precautions may develop in the future, or diseases with long incubation periods could arise, that could give rise to claims or allegations on a retroactive basis. One or more instances of foodborne illness in any of our restaurants or markets or related to food products we sell could negatively affect our restaurant revenue nationwide if highly publicized on national media outlets or through social media.\nThis risk exists even if it were later determined that the illness was wrongly attributed to us or one of our restaurants. Several other restaurant chains have experienced incidents related to foodborne illnesses that have had a material adverse effect on their operations. The occurrence of a similar incident at one or more of our restaurants, or negative publicity or public speculation about an incident, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate in the highly competitive restaurant industry. If we are not able to compete effectively, it will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face significant competition from restaurants in the fast-casual dining and traditional fast food segments of the restaurant industry. These segments are highly competitive with respect to, among other things, taste, price, food quality and presentation, service, location and the ambience and condition of each restaurant. Our competition includes a variety of locally owned restaurants and national and regional chains offering dine-in, carry-out, delivery and catering services. Many of our competitors have existed longer and have a more established market presence with substantially greater financial, marketing, personnel and other resources than we do. Among our competitors are a number of multi-unit, multi-market, fast casual restaurant concepts, some of which are expanding nationally. As we expand, we will face competition from these restaurant concepts as well as new competitors that strive to compete with our market segments. These competitors may have, among other things, lower operating costs, better locations, better facilities, better management, more effective marketing and more efficient operations. Additionally, we face the risk that new or existing competitors will copy our business model, menu options, presentation or ambience, among other things.\nAny inability to successfully compete with the restaurants in our markets and other restaurant segments will place downward pressure on our customer traffic and may prevent us from increasing or sustaining our revenue and profitability. Consumer tastes, nutritional and dietary trends, traffic patterns and the type, number and location of competing restaurants often affect the restaurant business, and our competitors may react more efficiently and effectively to those conditions. Several of our competitors compete by offering menu items that are specifically identified as low in carbohydrates, gluten-free or healthier for consumers. In addition, many of our traditional fast food restaurant competitors offer lower-priced menu options or meal packages or have loyalty programs. Our sales could decline due to changes in popular tastes, \u201cfad\u201d food regimens, such as low carbohydrate diets, and media attention on new restaurants. If we are unable to continue to compete effectively, our traffic, sales and restaurant contribution could decline which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe do not have full operational control over the franchisee-operated restaurants.\nWe are and will be dependent on our franchisees to maintain quality, service and cleanliness standards, and their failure to do so could materially affect our brands and harm our future growth. Our franchisees have flexibility in their operations, including the ability to set prices for our products in their restaurants, hire employees and select certain service providers. In addition, it is possible that some franchisees may not operate their restaurants in accordance with our quality, service and cleanliness, health or product standards. Although we intend to take corrective measures if franchisees fail to maintain high quality service and cleanliness standards, we may not be able to identify and rectify problems with sufficient speed and, as a result, our image and operating results may be negatively affected.\nOur business could be adversely affected by declines in discretionary spending and may be affected by changes in consumer preferences.\nOur success depends, in part, upon the popularity of our food products. Shifts in consumer preferences away from our restaurants or cuisine could harm our business. Also, our success depends to a significant extent on discretionary consumer spending, which is influenced by general economic conditions and the availability of discretionary income. Accordingly, we may experience declines in sales during economic downturns or during periods of uncertainty. A continuing decline in the amount of discretionary spending could have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations, and business and financial condition.\nIncreases in costs, including food, labor and energy prices, will adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur profitability is dependent on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in our operating costs, including food, labor, occupancy (including utilities and energy), insurance and supply costs. Various factors beyond our control, including climatic changes and government regulations, may affect food costs. Specifically, our dependence on frequent, timely deliveries of fresh meat and produce subject us to the risks of possible shortages or interruptions in supply caused by adverse weather or other conditions which could adversely affect the availability and cost of any such items. In the past, we have been able to recover some of our higher operating costs through increased menu prices. There have been, and there may be in the future, delays in implementing such menu price increases, and competitive pressures may limit our ability to recover such cost increases in their entirety.\nOur ability to maintain consistent price and quality throughout our restaurants depends in part upon our ability to acquire specified food products and supplies in sufficient quantities from third-party vendors, suppliers and distributors at a reasonable cost. We do not control the businesses of our vendors, suppliers and distributors, and our efforts to specify and monitor the standards under which they perform may not be successful. If any of our vendors or other suppliers are unable to fulfill their obligations to our standards, or if we are unable to find replacement providers in the event of a supply or service disruption, we could encounter supply shortages and incur higher costs to secure adequate supplies, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurthermore, if our current vendors or other suppliers are unable to support our expansion into new markets, or if we are unable to find vendors to meet our supply specifications or service needs as we expand, we could likewise encounter supply shortages and incur higher costs to secure adequate supplies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in employment laws and minimum wage standards may adversely affect our business.\nLabor is a primary component in the cost of operating our restaurants. If we face labor shortages or increased labor costs because of increased competition for employees, higher employee turnover rates, increases in the federal, state or local minimum wage or other employee benefits costs (including costs associated with health insurance coverage), our operating expenses could increase, and our growth could be negatively impacted.\nIn addition, our success depends in part upon our ability to attract, motivate and retain enough well-qualified restaurant operators and management personnel, as well as a sufficient number of other qualified employees, including customer service and kitchen staff, to keep pace with our expansion schedule. In addition, restaurants have traditionally experienced relatively high employee turnover rates. Although we have not yet experienced significant problems in recruiting or retaining employees, our ability to recruit and retain such individuals may delay the planned openings of new restaurants or result in higher employee turnover in existing restaurants, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nVarious federal and state employment laws govern the relationship with our employees and impact operating costs. These laws include employee classification as exempt or non-exempt for overtime and other purposes, minimum wage requirements, unemployment tax rates, workers\u2019 compensation rates, immigration status and other wage and benefit requirements. Significant additional government-imposed increases in the following areas could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations:\n\u25cf Minimum wages;\n\u25cf Mandatory health benefits;\n\u25cf Vacation accruals;\n\u25cf Paid leaves of absence, including paid sick leave; and\n\u25cf Tax reporting.\nWe could also become subject to fines, penalties and other costs related to claims that we did not fully comply with all recordkeeping obligations of federal and state immigration compliance laws. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to risks arising under federal and state labor laws.\nWe are subject to risks under federal and state labor laws, including disputes concerning whether and when a union can be organized, and once unionized, collective bargaining rights, various issues arising from union contracts, and matters relating to a labor strike. Labor laws are complex and differ vastly from state to state.\nWe are subject to the risks associated with leasing space subject to long-term non-cancelable leases.\nWe lease all the real property and we expect the new restaurants we open in the future will also be leased. We are obligated under non-cancelable leases for our restaurants and our corporate headquarters. Our restaurant leases generally require us to pay a proportionate share of real estate taxes, insurance, common area maintenance charges and other operating costs. Some restaurant leases provide for contingent rental payments based on sales thresholds, although we generally do not expect to pay significant contingent rent on these properties based on the thresholds in those leases. Additional sites that we lease are likely to be subject to similar long-term non-cancelable leases.\nIf an existing or future restaurant is not profitable, and we decide to close it, we may nonetheless be committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease including, among other things, paying the base rent for the balance of the lease term. In addition, as each of our leases expires, we may fail to negotiate renewals, either on commercially acceptable terms or at all, which could cause us to pay increased occupancy costs or to close restaurants in desirable locations. These potential increased occupancy costs and closed restaurants could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business and the growth of our Company are dependent on the skills and expertise of management and key personnel.\nDuring the upcoming stages of our Company\u2019s anticipated growth, we are entirely dependent upon the management skills and expertise of our management and key personnel. We do not have employment agreements with many of our executive officers. The loss of services of our executive officers could dramatically affect our business prospects. Certain of our employees are particularly valuable to us because:\n\u25cf they have specialized knowledge about our company and operations;\n\u25cf they have specialized skills that are important to our operations; or\n\u25cf they would be particularly difficult to replace.\nIf the services of any key management personnel ceased to be available to us, our growth prospects or future operating results may be adversely impacted.\nOur food service business, gaming revenues and the restaurant industry are subject to extensive government regulation.\nWe are subject to extensive and varied country, federal, state and local government regulation, including regulations relating to public health, gambling, safety and zoning codes. We operate each of our locations in accordance with standards and procedures designed to comply with applicable codes and regulations. However, if we could not obtain or retain food or other licenses, it would adversely affect our operations. Although we have not experienced, and do not anticipate experiencing any significant difficulties, delays or failures in obtaining required licenses, permits or approvals, any such problem could delay or prevent the opening of, or adversely impact the viability of, a particular location or group of restaurants.\nWe may be subject to significant foreign currency exchange controls in certain countries in which we operate.\nCertain foreign economies have experienced shortages in foreign currency reserves and their respective governments have adopted restrictions on the ability to transfer funds out of the country and convert local currencies into U.S. dollars. This may increase our costs and limit our ability to convert local currency into U.S. dollars and transfer funds out of certain countries. Any shortages or restrictions may impede our ability to convert these currencies into U.S. dollars and to transfer funds, including for the payment of dividends or interest or principal on our outstanding debt. If any of our subsidiaries are unable to transfer funds to us due to currency restrictions, we are responsible for any resulting shortfall.\nOur foreign operations subject us to risks that could negatively affect our business.\nOne of our Hooters restaurants and some of our franchisee-owned restaurants operate in foreign countries and territories outside of the U.S. As a result, our business is exposed to risks inherent in foreign operations. These risks, which can vary substantially by market, include political instability, corruption, social and ethnic unrest, changes in economic conditions (including wage and commodity inflation, consumer spending and unemployment levels), the regulatory environment, tax rates and laws and consumer preferences as well as changes in the laws and policies that govern foreign investment in countries where our restaurants are operated.\nIn addition, our results of operations and the value of our foreign assets are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which may adversely affect reported earnings. More specifically, an increase in the value of the United States Dollar relative to other currencies, such as the British Pound, could have an adverse effect on our reported earnings. There can be no assurance as to the future effect of any such changes on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nWe may not attain our target development goals and aggressive development could cannibalize existing sales.\nOur growth strategy depends in large part on our ability to increase our net restaurant count. The successful development of new units will depend in large part on our ability and the ability of our franchisees to open new restaurants and to operate these restaurants on a profitable basis. We cannot guarantee that we, or our franchisees, will be able to achieve our expansion goals or that new restaurants will be operated profitably. Further, there is no assurance that any new restaurant will produce operating results like those of our existing restaurants. Other risks that could impact our ability to increase our net restaurant count include prevailing economic conditions and our, or our franchisees\u2019/partners\u2019, ability to obtain suitable restaurant locations, obtain required permits and approvals in a timely manner and hire and train qualified personnel.\nOur franchisee operators also frequently depend upon financing from banks and other financial institutions in order to construct and open new restaurants. If it becomes more difficult or expensive for our franchisees/partners to obtain financing to develop new restaurants, our planned growth could slow, and our future revenue and cash flows could be adversely impacted.\nIn addition, the new restaurants could impact the sales of our existing restaurants nearby. It is not our intention to open new restaurants that materially cannibalize the sales of our existing restaurants. However, as with most growing retail and restaurant operations, there can be no assurance that sales cannibalization will not occur or become more significant in the future as we increase our presence in existing markets over time.\nThe recent global coronavirus COVID-19 outbreak could harm our business and results of operations.\nIn March 2020 the World Health Organization declared coronavirus COVID-19 a global pandemic. This contagious disease outbreak, which has continued to spread, and any related adverse public health developments, has adversely affected workforces, customers, economies, and financial markets globally, potentially leading to an economic downturn. It has also disrupted the normal operations of many businesses, including ours. It is not possible for us to predict the duration or magnitude of the adverse results of the outbreak and its effects on our business or results of operations at this time. A health pandemic is a disease outbreak that spreads rapidly and widely by infection and affects many individuals in an area or population at the same time. Customers might avoid public gathering places in the event of a health pandemic, and local, regional or national governments might limit or ban public gatherings to halt or delay the spread of disease. The conditions may impact our restaurant customer traffic and our ability to adequately staff our restaurants, receive deliveries on a timely basis or perform functions at the corporate level. We also may be adversely affected if jurisdictions in which we have restaurants impose mandatory closures, seek voluntary closures or impose restrictions on operations. Even if such measures are not implemented, the perceived risk of infection or significant health risk may adversely affect our business.\nChanging conditions in the global economy and financial markets may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and ability to raise capital.\nOur business and results of operations may be materially affected by conditions in the financial markets and the economy generally. The demand for our products could be adversely affected in an economic downturn and our revenues may decline under such circumstances. In addition, we may find it difficult, or we may not be able, to access the credit or equity markets, or we may experience higher funding costs in the event of adverse market conditions. Future instability in these markets could limit our ability to access the capital we require to fund and grow our business.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. If not remediated, our failure to establish and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could result in material misstatements in our financial statements and a failure to meet our reporting and financial obligations, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and the trading price of our common stock.\nMaintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and effective disclosure controls and procedures are necessary for us to produce reliable financial statements. As discussed in Item 9A - \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d of this Form 10-K, we have re-evaluated our internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures and concluded that they were not effective as of December 31, 2019.\nA material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nThe Company is committed to remediating its material weaknesses as promptly as possible. Implementation of the Company\u2019s remediation plans has commenced and is being overseen by the audit committee. However, there can be no assurance as to when these material weaknesses will be remediated or that additional material weaknesses will not arise in the future. Even effective internal control can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. Any failure to remediate the material weaknesses, or the development of new material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, could result in material misstatements in our financial statements, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and the trading price of our common stock and we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations.\nChanges to accounting rules or regulations may adversely affect the reporting of our results of operations.\nChanges to existing accounting rules or regulations may impact the reporting of our future results of operations or cause the perception that we are more highly leveraged. Other new accounting rules or regulations and varying interpretations of existing accounting rules or regulations have occurred and may occur in the future. For instance, new accounting rules will require lessees to capitalize operating leases in their financial statements in future periods which will require us to record significant right of use assets and lease obligations on our balance sheet. This and other future changes to accounting rules or regulations could have a material adverse effect on the reporting of our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, many existing accounting standards require management to make subjective assumptions, such as those required for stock compensation, tax matters, franchise accounting, acquisitions, litigation, and asset impairment calculations. Changes in accounting standards or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates and judgments by our management could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property, which could harm the value of our brand and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur intellectual property is material to the conduct of our business. Our ability to implement our business plan successfully depends in part on our ability to further build brand recognition using our trademarks, tradenames and other proprietary intellectual property, including our name and logos and the unique ambience of our restaurants. While it is our policy to protect and defend vigorously our rights to our intellectual property, we cannot predict whether steps taken by us to protect our intellectual property rights will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of these rights or the use by others of restaurant features based upon, or otherwise similar to, our restaurant concept. It may be difficult for us to prevent others from copying elements of our concept and any litigation to enforce our rights will likely be costly and may not be successful. Although we believe that we have sufficient rights to all our trademarks and service marks, we may face claims of infringement that could interfere with our ability to market our restaurants and promote our brand. Any such litigation may be costly and could divert resources from our business. Moreover, if we are unable to successfully defend against such claims, we may be prevented from using our trademarks or service marks in the future and may be liable for damages, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, we license certain of our proprietary intellectual property, including our name and logos, to third parties. For example, we grant our franchisees and licensees a right to use certain of our trademarks in connection with their operation of the applicable restaurant. If a franchisee or other licensee fails to maintain the quality of the restaurant operations associated with the licensed trademarks, our rights to, and the value of, our trademarks could potentially be harmed. Negative publicity relating to the franchisee or licensee could also be incorrectly associated with us, which could harm our business. Failure to maintain, control and protect our trademarks and other proprietary intellectual property would likely have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and on our ability to enter into new franchise agreements.\nWe may incur costs resulting from breaches of security of confidential consumer information related to our electronic processing of credit and debit card transactions.\nMost of our restaurant sales are by credit or debit cards. Other restaurants and retailers have experienced security breaches in which credit and debit card information has been stolen. We may in the future become subject to claims for purportedly fraudulent transactions arising out of the actual or alleged theft of credit or debit card information, and we may also be subject to lawsuits or other proceedings relating to these types of incidents. In addition, most states have enacted legislation requiring notification of security breaches involving personal information, including credit and debit card information. Any such claim or proceeding could cause us to incur significant unplanned expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, adverse publicity resulting from these allegations may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe rely heavily on information technology, and any material failure, weakness, interruption or breach of security could prevent us from effectively operating our business.\nWe rely heavily on information systems, including point-of-sale processing in our restaurants, for management of our supply chain, payment of obligations, collection of cash, credit and debit card transactions and other processes and procedures. Our ability to efficiently and effectively manage our business depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these systems. Our operations depend upon our ability to protect our computer equipment and systems against damage from physical theft, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or other catastrophic events, as well as from internal and external security breaches, viruses and other disruptive problems. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, maintenance problems, upgrading or transitioning to new platforms, or a breach in security of these systems could result in delays in customer service and reduce efficiency in our operations. Remediation of such problems could result in significant, unplanned capital investments.\nAdverse weather conditions could affect our sales.\nAdverse weather conditions, such as regional winter storms, floods, severe thunderstorms and hurricanes, could affect our sales at restaurants in locations that experience these weather conditions, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe uncertainty surrounding the effect of Brexit may impact our UK operations.\nThe uncertainty surrounding the effect of Brexit, including the uncertainty in relation to the legal and regulatory framework for the UK and its relationship with the remaining members of the EU (including, in relation to trade) after Brexit was effected in January 2020, has caused increased economic volatility and market uncertainty globally. It is too early to ascertain the long-term effects.\nNegative publicity could reduce sales at some or all our restaurants.\nWe may, from time to time, be faced with negative publicity relating to food quality and integrity, the safety, sanitation and welfare of our restaurant facilities, customer complaints, labor issues, or litigation alleging illness or injury, health inspection scores, integrity of our or our suppliers\u2019 food processing and other policies, practices and procedures, employee relationships and welfare or other matters at one or more of our restaurants. Negative publicity may adversely affect us, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are held to be responsible. The risk of negative publicity is particularly great with respect to our franchised restaurants because we are limited in the manner in which we can regulate them, especially on a real-time basis and negative publicity from our franchised restaurants may also significantly impact company-operated restaurants. A similar risk exists with respect to food service businesses unrelated to us, if customers mistakenly associate such unrelated businesses with our operations. Employee claims against us based on, among other things, wage and hour violations, discrimination, harassment or wrongful termination may also create not only legal and financial liability but negative publicity that could adversely affect us and divert our financial and management resources that would otherwise be used to benefit the future performance of our operations. These types of employee claims could also be asserted against us, on a co-employer theory, by employees of our franchisees. A significant increase in the number of these claims or an increase in the number of successful claims could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe interests of our franchisees may conflict with ours or yours in the future and we could face liability from our franchisees or related to our relationship with our franchisees.\nFranchisees, as independent business operators, may from time to time disagree with us and our strategies regarding the business or our interpretation of our respective rights and obligations under the franchise agreement and the terms and conditions of the franchisee/franchisor relationship or have interests adverse to ours. This may lead to disputes with our franchisees and we expect such disputes to occur from time to time in the future as we continue to offer franchises. Such disputes may result in legal action against us. To the extent we have such disputes, the attention, time and financial resources of our management and our franchisees will be diverted from our restaurants, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows even if we have a successful outcome in the dispute.\nIn addition, various state and federal laws govern our relationship with our franchisees and our potential sale of a franchise. A franchisee and/or a government agency may bring legal action against us based on the franchisee/franchisor relationships that could result in the award of damages to franchisees and/or the imposition of fines or other penalties against us.\nWe have significant obligations under payables and debt obligations. Our ability to operate as a going concern are contingent upon successfully obtaining additional financing and renegotiating terms of existing indebtedness in the near future. Failure to do so would adversely affect our ability to continue operations.\nIf capital is not available or we are not able to agree on reasonable terms with our lenders, we may then need to scale back or freeze our organic growth plans, sell assets under unfavorable terms, reduce expenses, and/or curtail future acquisition plans to manage our liquidity and capital resources. We may not be able refinance or otherwise extend or repay our current obligations, which could impact our ability to continue to operate as a going concern.\nIn the event that management proceeds with asset sales and/or store closures rather than continuing to hold and operate all its assets long term, management\u2019s assessment of the fair value, and ultimate recoverability, of goodwill, intangibles, and other long-lived assets would be impacted and the Company could incur significant noncash charges and cash exit costs in future periods.\nWe have approximately $18.1 million in current liabilities. In the event that additional working capital is not available, we may be forced to scale back or freeze our growth plans, sell assets on less than favorable terms, reduce expenses, and/or curtail future acquisition plans to manage our liquidity and capital resources. In the event that management elects to proceed with asset sales and/or store closures in the future rather than continue to hold and operate all its assets long term, management\u2019s assessment of the fair value, and ultimate recoverability, of goodwill, intangibles, and other long-lived assets would be impacted and the Company could incur significant noncash charges and cash exit costs in future periods.\nWe have remedied defaults under our debt obligations. However, we may not be able to refinance, extend or repay our substantial indebtedness owed to our secured lenders, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe have approximately $18.1 million in current liabilities, which includes $6.6 million of debt. If we are unable to repay these obligations at maturity and we are otherwise unable to extend the maturity dates or refinance these obligations, we would be in default. We cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to raise the necessary amount of capital to repay these obligations or that we will be able to extend the maturity dates or otherwise refinance these obligations. Upon a default, our secured lenders would have the right to exercise their rights and remedies to collect, which would include foreclosing on our assets. Accordingly, a default would have a material adverse effect on our business, and we would likely be forced to seek bankruptcy protection.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur stock price has experienced price fluctuations and may continue to do so, resulting in a substantial loss in your investment.\nThe current market for our common stock has been characterized by volatile prices. As a result, investors in our common stock may experience a decrease in the value of their securities, including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects. The market price of our common stock is likely to be highly unpredictable and subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u25cf quarterly variations in our operating results and achievement of key business metrics;\n\u25cf changes in the global economy and in the local economies in which we operate;\n\u25cf our ability to obtain working capital financing, if necessary;\n\u25cf the departure of any of our key executive officers and directors;\n\u25cf changes in the federal, state, and local laws and regulations to which we are subject;\n\u25cf changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts, if any;\n\u25cf any differences from reported results and securities analysts published or unpublished expectations;\n\u25cf market reaction to any acquisitions, joint ventures or strategic investments announced by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf future sales of our securities;\n\u25cf announcements or press releases relating to the casual dining restaurant sector or to our own business or prospects;\n\u25cf negative media and social media coverage;\n\u25cf regulatory, legislative, or other developments affecting us or the restaurant industry generally; and\n\u25cf market conditions specific to casual dining restaurant, the restaurant industry and the stock market generally.\nOur common stock could be further diluted as the result of the issuance of additional shares of common stock, convertible securities, warrants or options.\nIn the past, we have issued common stock, convertible securities (such as convertible notes) and warrants in order to raise capital. We have also issued common stock as compensation for services and incentive compensation for our employees, directors and certain vendors. We have shares of common stock reserved for issuance upon the exercise of certain of these securities and may increase the shares reserved for these purposes in the future. Our issuance of additional common stock, convertible securities, options and warrants could affect the rights of our stockholders, could reduce the market price of our common stock or could result in adjustments to exercise prices of outstanding warrants (resulting in these securities becoming exercisable for, as the case may be, a greater number of shares of our common stock), or could obligate us to issue additional shares of common stock to certain of our stockholders.\nShares eligible for future sale may adversely affect the market.\nFrom time to time, certain of our stockholders may be eligible to sell all or some of their shares of common stock by means of ordinary brokerage transactions in the open market pursuant to Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act, subject to certain limitations. In general, pursuant to Rule 144, stockholders who have been non-affiliates for the preceding three months may sell shares of our common stock freely after six months subject only to the current public information requirement. Affiliates may sell shares of our common stock after six months subject to the Rule 144 volume, manner of sale, current public information and notice requirements. Any substantial sales of our common stock pursuant to Rule 144 may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nWe do not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore investors should not anticipate cash dividends on their investment.\nOur board of directors does not intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future but instead intends to retain any and all earnings to finance the growth of the business. To date, we have not paid any cash dividends and there can be no assurance that cash dividends will ever be paid on our common stock.\nWe may issue additional shares of our common stock, which could depress the market price of our common stock and dilute your ownership.\nMarket sales of large amounts of our common stock, or the potential for those sales even if they do not actually occur, may have the effect of depressing the market price of our common stock. In addition, if our future financing needs require us to issue additional shares of common stock or securities convertible into common stock, the amount of common stock available for resale could be increased which could stimulate trading activity and cause the market price of our common stock to drop, even if our business is doing well. Furthermore, the issuance of any additional shares of our common stock, or securities convertible into our common stock could be substantially dilutive to holders of our common stock.\nDirector and officer liability is limited.\nAs permitted by Delaware law, our bylaws limit the liability of our directors for monetary damages for breach of a director\u2019s fiduciary duty except for liability in certain instances. As a result of our bylaw provisions and Delaware law, stockholders may have limited rights to recover against directors for breach of fiduciary duty.\nFailure to establish and maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price.\nAs a publicly traded company, we are required to comply with the SEC\u2019s rules implementing Sections 302 and 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which requires management to certify financial and other information in our quarterly and annual reports and provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of controls over financial reporting. We have identified internal control weaknesses and may need to undertake various actions, such as implementing new internal controls, new systems and procedures and hiring additional accounting or internal audit staff, which could increase our operating expenses. In addition, we may identify additional deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting as part of that process.\nIn addition, if we are unable to resolve internal control deficiencies in a timely manner, investors could lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock could be negatively affected.\nRisks Related to the Merger\nThe exchange ratio set forth in the Merger Agreement is not adjustable based on the market price of our common stock, so the merger consideration at the closing of the Merger may have a greater or lesser value than at the time the Merger Agreement was signed.\nAny changes in the market price of our common stock before the completion of the Merger will not affect the number of shares of our common stock issuable to Sonnet\u2019s stockholders pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Therefore, if before the completion of the Merger the market price of our common stock increases from the market price of our common stock on the date of the Merger Agreement, then Sonnet\u2019s stockholders could receive merger consideration with substantially greater value than the value of such merger consideration on the date of the Merger Agreement. Similarly, if before the completion of the Merger the market price of our common stock declines from the market price on the date of the Merger Agreement, then Sonnet\u2019s stockholders could receive merger consideration with substantially lower value than the value of such merger consideration on the date of the Merger Agreement. The Merger Agreement does not include a price-based termination right. Because the exchange ratio does not adjust as a result of changes in the market price of our common stock, for each one percentage point change in the market price of our common stock, there is a corresponding one percentage point rise or decline, respectively, in the value of the total merger consideration payable to Sonnet\u2019s stockholders pursuant to the Merger Agreement.\nThe proposed Merger is subject to approval of the Merger Agreement by our stockholders and the Sonnet stockholders. Failure to obtain these approvals would prevent the closing of the Merger.\nBefore the proposed Merger can be completed, the stockholders of each of Chanticleer and Sonnet must approve the Merger Agreement. Failure to obtain the required stockholder approvals may result in a material delay in, or the abandonment of, the Merger. Any delay in completing the proposed Merger may materially adversely affect the timing and benefits that are expected to be achieved from the proposed Merger.\nCertain provisions of the Merger Agreement may discourage third parties from submitting alternative takeover proposals, including proposals that may be superior to the arrangements contemplated by the Merger Agreement.\nThe terms of the Merger Agreement prohibit each of Chanticleer and Sonnet from soliciting alternative takeover proposals or cooperating with persons making unsolicited takeover proposals, except in limited circumstances when such party\u2019s board of directors determines in good faith that an unsolicited alternative takeover proposal is or is reasonably likely to lead to a superior takeover proposal and that failure to cooperate with the proponent of the proposal would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the applicable board\u2019s fiduciary duties.\nBecause the lack of a public market for Sonnet\u2019s capital stock makes it difficult to evaluate the value of Sonnet\u2019s capital stock, the stockholders of Sonnet may receive shares of our common stock in the Merger that have a value that is less than, or greater than, the fair market value of Sonnet\u2019s capital stock.\nThe outstanding capital stock of Sonnet is privately held and is not traded in any public market. The lack of a public market makes it extremely difficult to determine the fair market value of Sonnet. Because the percentage of our common stock to be issued to Sonnet\u2019s stockholders was determined based on negotiations between the parties, it is possible that the value of our common stock to be received by Sonnet\u2019s stockholders will be less than the fair market value of Sonnet, or Chanticleer may pay more than the aggregate fair market value for Sonnet.\nIf the conditions to the Merger are not met, the Merger will not occur.\nEven if the Merger is approved by the stockholders of Chanticleer and Sonnet, specified conditions must be satisfied or waived to complete the Merger. We cannot assure you that all of the conditions will be satisfied or waived. If the conditions are not satisfied or waived, the Merger will not occur or will be delayed, and Chanticleer and Sonnet each may lose some or all of the intended benefits of the proposed Merger. Additionally, if the Merger does not occur, we may not have sufficient cash to continue operations.\nLitigation relating to the proposed Merger could require Chanticleer or Sonnet to incur significant costs and suffer management distraction, and could delay or enjoin the proposed Merger.\nChanticleer and Sonnet could be subject to demands or litigation related to the proposed Merger, whether or not the Merger is consummated. Such actions may create uncertainty relating to the Merger, or delay or enjoin the Merger, and responding to such demands. In addition, such demands or litigation could lead to a dissolution or bankruptcy if the costs associated with such demands or litigation are significant enough.\nDuring the pendency of the proposed Merger, Chanticleer and Sonnet may not be able to enter into a business combination with another party at a favorable price because of restrictions in the Merger Agreement, which could adversely affect their respective businesses.\nCovenants in the Merger Agreement impede the ability of Chanticleer and Sonnet to make acquisitions, subject to certain exceptions relating to fiduciary duties or to complete other transactions that are not in the ordinary course of business pending completion of the proposed Merger. As a result, if the Merger is not completed, the parties may be at a disadvantage to their competitors during such period. In addition, while the Merger Agreement is in effect, each party is generally prohibited from soliciting, initiating, encouraging or entering into certain extraordinary transactions, such as a merger, sale of assets, or other business combination outside the ordinary course of business with any third party, subject to certain exceptions relating to fiduciary duties. Any such transactions could be favorable to such party\u2019s stockholders\nWe received a deficiency letter in December 2018 from the (the Staff of Nasdaq notifying the Company that it was not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(2). If we were to fail to regain compliance, our shares could be delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market, which could materially reduce the liquidity of our common stock and have an adverse effect on our market price. A delisting could limit our ability to consummate the proposed Merger.\nOn August 14, 2019, we received notification from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market (\u201cNasdaq\u201d) indicating that, for the 30 consecutive business days ending August 13, 2019, the bid price for the Company\u2019s common stock had closed below the $1.00 per share minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). (the \u201cBid Price Rule\u201d). The Nasdaq notice indicated that, in accordance with Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company will be provided 180 calendar days through February 10, 2020 to regain compliance. If, at any time before February 10, 2020 the bid price of the Company\u2019s common stock closes at $1.00 per share or more for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days, Nasdaq staff will provide written notification that it has achieved compliance with the Bid Price Rule. If the Company fails to regain compliance with the Bid Price Rule before February 10, 2020 but meets all of the other applicable standards for initial listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market with the exception of the minimum bid price, then the Company may be eligible to have an additional 180 calendar days to regain compliance with the Bid Price Rule. To regain compliance with Rule 5550(b)(2), the market value of our listed securities must meet or exceed $35 million for a minimum of ten consecutive business days during the 180-day grace period ending on or before February 10, 2020 (Nasdaq has the discretion to monitor compliance for as long as 20 consecutive business days before deeming us in compliance). We could also regain compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s alternative continued listing requirements by having stockholders\u2019 equity of $2.5 million or more, or net income from continuing operations of $500,000 in the most recently completed fiscal year.\nA delisting would also likely make it more difficult for us to obtain financing through the sale of our equity. Any such sale of equity would likely be more dilutive to our current stockholders than would be the case if our shares were listed.\nWe may not satisfy The Nasdaq Capital Market\u2019s other requirements for continued listing. If we cannot satisfy these requirements, Nasdaq could delist our common stock and could impact our ability to consummate the proposed Merger.\nOur common stock is listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol \u201cBURG\u201d. To continue to be listed on Nasdaq, we are required to satisfy a number of conditions. We cannot assure you that we will be able to satisfy the Nasdaq listing requirements in the future. If we are delisted from Nasdaq, trading in our shares of common stock may be conducted, if available, on the \u201cOTC Bulletin Board Service\u201d or, if available, via another market. In the event of such delisting, an investor would likely find it significantly more difficult to dispose of, or to obtain accurate quotations as to the value of the shares of our common stock, and our ability to raise future capital through the sale of the shares of our common stock or other securities convertible into or exercisable for our common stock could be severely limited. This could have a long-term impact on our ability to raise future capital through the sale of our common stock.\nFailure to complete the merger may result in Chanticleer or Sonnet paying a termination fee to the other party and could harm the common stock price of Chanticleer and future business and operations of each company.\nIf the merger is not completed, Chanticleer and Sonnet are subject to the following risks:\n\u25cf if the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances and certain events occur, Chanticleer or Sonnet will be required to pay the other party a termination fee of $500,000;\n\u25cf the price of Chanticleer stock may decline; and\n\u25cf costs related to the merger, such as legal, accounting and investment banking fees must be paid even if the merger is not completed.\nIn addition, if the Merger Agreement is terminated and the Chanticleer or Sonnet board of directors determines to seek another business combination, there can be no assurance that Chanticleer or Sonnet will be able to find a partner willing to provide equivalent or more attractive consideration than the consideration to be provided by each party in the merger.\nChanticleer may be unable to identify and complete an alternative strategic transaction or continue to operate the business due to its limited cash availability, and it may be required to dissolve and liquidate its assets. In such case, Chanticleer would be required to pay all of its debts and contractual obligations, and to set aside certain reserves for potential future claims, and there can be no assurances as to the amount or timing of available cash, if any, left to distribute to stockholders after paying the debts and other obligations of Chanticleer and setting aside funds for reserves.\nAs of December 31, 2019, Chanticleer\u2019s cash balance was approximately $500,000, its working capital was negative $16.9 million, and it had significant near-term commitments and contractual obligations. Chanticleer has typically funded its operating costs, acquisition activities, working capital requirements and capital expenditures with proceeds from the issuances of its common stock and other financing arrangements, including convertible debt, lines of credit, notes payable, capital leases, and other forms of external financing. Chanticleer has $6.6 million of principal due on its debt obligations as of December 31, 2019, plus interest. In addition, if Chanticleer fails to meet various debt covenants going forward and is notified of the default by the noteholders of the 8% non-convertible secured debentures, Chanticleer may be assessed additional default interest and penalties which would increase its obligations. Chanticleer cannot provide assurance that it will be able to refinance its long-term debt or sell assets or raise additional capital.\nIn the event that capital is not available, or Chanticleer is unable to refinance its debt obligations or obtain waivers, it may then have to scale back or freeze its organic growth plans, sell assets on less than favorable terms, reduce expenses, and/or curtail future acquisition plans to manage its liquidity and capital resources. Chanticleer may also incur financial penalties or other negative actions from its lenders if it is not able to refinance or otherwise extend or repay its current obligations or obtain waivers. As of December 31, 2019, Chanticleer and its subsidiaries had approximately $2.9 million of accrued employee and employer taxes, including penalties and interest, which are due to certain taxing authorities. Chanticleer is currently in discussions with various taxing authorities on settling these liabilities through payment plans.\nThe consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement is dependent upon Chanticleer and Sonnet obtaining all relevant and necessary consents and approvals.\nA condition to consummation of the merger is that Chanticleer and Sonnet obtain certain consents or approvals from third parties, including consents from parties to certain commercial agreements, leases and debt agreements in connection with the merger and the Spin-Off and approval from NASDAQ to maintain the listing of the Chanticleer Common Stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market following the merger and to list the shares of Chanticleer Common Stock being issued in the merger. In addition, the stockholders of Chanticleer must approve the issuance of Chanticleer Common Stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement. The Sonnet shareholders must adopt the Merger Agreement and approve the merger to be consummated pursuant thereto. There can be no assurance that Chanticleer or Sonnet will be able to obtain all such relevant consents and approvals on a timely basis or at all. Each of Chanticleer and Sonnet has incurred, and expects to continue to incur, significant costs and expenses in connection with the proposed merger. Any failure to obtain, or delay in obtaining, the necessary consents or approvals would prevent Chanticleer and Sonnet from being able to consummate, or delay the consummation of, the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, which could materially adversely affect the business, financial condition and results of operations of Chanticleer and Sonnet, and, correspondingly, the combined company if the merger is consummated. There is no guarantee that such approvals will be obtained or that such conditions will be satisfied.\nThe $6 Million Payment Condition may not be satisfied.\nOne of the conditions to the obligations of Chanticleer under the Merger Agreement is that on or prior to the closing of the merger, Sonnet shall satisfy the $6 Million Payment Condition. No assurance can be given that Sonnet will be able to raise the remaining funds necessary to satisfy the $6 Million Payment Condition. If Sonnet cannot raise additional funds on acceptable terms and if Chanticleer is not otherwise willing to waive the $6 Million Payment Condition, the parties will not be able to consummate the merger.\nThe merger may be completed even though material adverse changes may result from the announcement of the merger, industry-wide changes and other causes.\nIn general, either Chanticleer or Sonnet can refuse to complete the merger if there is a material adverse change affecting the other party between October 10, 2019, the date of the Merger Agreement, and the closing. However, certain types of changes do not permit either party to refuse to complete the merger, even if such change could be said to have a material adverse effect on Chanticleer or Sonnet, including:\n\u25cf general business or economic conditions affecting the industries in which Sonnet or Chanticleer operate (except to the extent any changes in such conditions have a disproportionate effect on Sonnet or Chanticleer relative to other participants in such industries);\n\u25cf natural disasters, acts of war, armed hostilities or terrorism;\n\u25cf changes in financial, banking or securities markets;\n\u25cf the taking of any action required to be taken by the Merger Agreement; or\n\u25cf with respect to Chanticleer, any change in the stock price or trading volume of Chanticleer common stock.\nIf adverse changes occur and Chanticleer and Sonnet still complete the merger, the combined company stock price may suffer. This in turn may reduce the value of the merger to the stockholders of Chanticleer and Sonnet.\nThe combined company will need to raise additional capital by issuing securities or debt or through licensing arrangements, which may cause dilution to the combined company\u2019s stockholders or restrict the combined company\u2019s operations or proprietary rights.\nThe combined company will be required to raise additional capital and may be required to raise funds sooner than currently planned. Additional financing may not be available to the combined company when it needs it or may not be available on favorable terms. To the extent that the combined company raises additional capital by issuing equity securities, such an issuance may cause significant dilution to the combined company\u2019s stockholders\u2019 ownership and the terms of any new equity securities may have preferences over the combined company\u2019s common stock. Any debt financing the combined company enters into may involve covenants that restrict its operations. These restrictive covenants may include limitations on additional borrowing and specific restrictions on the use of the combined company\u2019s assets, as well as prohibitions on its ability to create liens, pay dividends, redeem its stock or make investments. In addition, if the combined company raises additional funds through licensing arrangements, it may be necessary to grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to the combined company.\nCertain Chanticleer and Sonnet executive officers and directors have interests in the merger that are different from yours and that may influence them to support or approve the merger without regard to your interests.\nCertain officers and directors of Chanticleer and Sonnet participate in arrangements that provide them with interests in the merger that are different from yours, including, among others, the continued service as directors and officers of the combined company, in the case of Sonnet, severance benefits and continued indemnification.\nFor example, all of the current officers and directors of Sonnet will continue as the officers and directors of the combined company upon the closing of the merger.\nChanticleer and Sonnet stockholders may not realize a benefit from the merger commensurate with the ownership dilution they will experience in connection with the merger.\nIf the combined company is unable to realize the full strategic and financial benefits currently anticipated from the merger, Chanticleer and Sonnet securityholders will have experienced substantial dilution of their ownership interests in their respective companies without receiving any commensurate benefit, or only receiving part of the commensurate benefit to the extent the combined company is able to realize only part of the strategic and financial benefits currently anticipated from the merger.\nThe issuance of shares of Chanticleer Common Stock to Sonnet shareholders in the merger will dilute substantially the voting power of Chanticleer\u2019s current stockholders.\nIf the merger is completed, the former Sonnet shareholders will hold approximately 94% of the outstanding shares of Chanticleer Common Stock, the stockholders of Chanticleer will retain ownership of only approximately 6% of the outstanding shares of Chanticleer Common Stock and the Spin-Off Entity will hold the Spin-Off Entity Warrant, exercisable for 2% of the outstanding shares of Chanticleer Common Stock. Accordingly, the issuance of shares of Chanticleer Common Stock to Sonnet shareholders in the merger will reduce substantially the voting power of each share of Chanticleer Common Stock held by Chanticleer\u2019s current security holders. Consequently, Chanticleer security holders as a group will have substantially less influence over the management and policies of the combined company after the merger, than prior thereto.\nThe pendency of the merger could have an adverse effect on the trading price of Chanticleer Common Stock and Chanticleer\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations or business prospects.\nWhile there have been no significant adverse effects to date, the pendency of the merger could disrupt Chanticleer\u2019s businesses in the following ways, including:\n\u25cf the attention of Chanticleer\u2019s management may be directed toward the closing of the merger and related matters and may be diverted from the day-to-day business operations; and\n\u25cf third parties may seek to terminate or renegotiate their relationships with Chanticleer as a result of the merger, whether pursuant to the terms of their existing agreements with Chanticleer or otherwise.\nShould they occur, any of these matters could adversely affect the trading price of Chanticleer Common Stock or harm Chanticleer\u2019s and/or the Spin-Off Entity\u2019s financial condition, results of operations or business prospects.\nChanticleer and Sonnet do not anticipate that the combined company will pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nThe current expectation is that the combined company will retain its future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of the combined company\u2019s business. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of the common stock of the combined company will be your sole source of gain, if any, for the foreseeable future.\nThe ownership of the combined company common stock is expected to be highly concentrated, which may prevent you and other stockholders from influencing significant corporate decisions and may result in conflicts of interest that could cause the combined company stock price to decline.\nExecutive officers and directors of the combined company and their affiliates are expected to beneficially own or control significant number of the outstanding shares of the combined company common stock following the closing of the merger. Accordingly, these executive officers, directors and their affiliates, acting as a group, will have substantial influence over the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of the combined company assets or any other significant corporate transactions. These stockholders may also delay or prevent a change of control of the combined company, even if such a change of control would benefit the other stockholders of the combined company. The significant concentration of stock ownership may adversely affect the trading price of the combined company\u2019s common stock due to investors\u2019 perception that conflicts of interest may exist or arise.\nAnti-takeover provisions under Delaware law could make an acquisition of the combined company more difficult and may prevent attempts by the combined company stockholders to replace or remove the combined company management.\nBecause the combined company will be incorporated in Delaware, it is governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or the DGCL, which prohibits stockholders owning in excess of 15% of the outstanding combined company voting stock from merging or combining with the combined company. Although Chanticleer and Sonnet believe these provisions collectively will provide for an opportunity to receive higher bids by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with the combined company\u2019s board of directors, they would apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by the combined company\u2019s stockholders to replace or remove then current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of the board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of management.\nThe rights of holders of Sonnet securities will change as a result of the merger.\nAfter the merger, the rights of those shareholders of Sonnet who will become Chanticleer stockholders will be governed by Chanticleer\u2019s certificate of incorporation and Chanticleer\u2019s bylaws, which are governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, which may be different from the laws of the State of New Jersey.\nThe historical audited and unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information may not be representative of our results after the merger.\nThe historical audited and unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information included elsewhere in this prospectus has been presented for informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the financial position or results of operations that actually would have occurred had the merger been completed as of the date indicated, nor is it indicative of future operating results or financial position.\nThe market price of the combined company\u2019s common stock following the merger and the Spin-Off may decline as a result of the merger.\nThe market price of the combined company\u2019s common stock may decline as a result of the merger and the Spin-Off for a number of reasons including if:\n\u25cf investors react negatively to the prospects of the combined company\u2019s business and prospects from the merger and the Spin-Off;\n\u25cf the effect of the merger and Spin-Off on the combined company\u2019s business and prospects is not consistent with the expectations of financial or industry analysts; or\n\u25cf the combined company does not achieve the perceived benefits of the merger and the Spin-Off as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by financial or industry analysts.", "PERMNO": 13455, "SIC": 5812, "TIC": "BURG"}
