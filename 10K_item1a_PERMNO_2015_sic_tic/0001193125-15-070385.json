{"cik": "1409970", "company": "LendingClub Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the section titled \u201cItem 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and the consolidated financial statements and related notes. While we believe the risks and uncertainties described below include all material risks currently known by us, it is possible that these may not be the only ones we face. If any of the risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY\nAs a rapidly growing company with a relatively limited operating history at our current scale, we face increased risks, uncertainties, expenses and difficulties.\nWe have a limited operating history at our current scale, and we have encountered and will continue to encounter risks, uncertainties, expenses and difficulties, including:\n\u2022\nnavigating complex and evolving regulatory and competitive environments;\n\u2022\nincreasing the number of borrowers and investors utilizing our marketplace;\n\u2022\nincreasing the volume of loans facilitated through our marketplace and transaction fees received for matching borrowers and investors through our marketplace;\n\u2022\nentering into new markets and introducing new loan products;\n\u2022\ncontinuing to revise our marketplace\u2019s proprietary credit decisioning and scoring models;\n\u2022\ncontinuing to develop, maintain and scale our platform;\n\u2022\neffectively using limited personnel and technology resources;\n\u2022\neffectively maintaining and scaling our financial and risk management controls and procedures;\n\u2022\nmaintaining the security of our platform and the confidentiality of the information provided and utilized across our platform; and\n\u2022\nattracting, integrating and retaining an appropriate number of qualified employees.\nWe have incurred net losses in the past and may incur net losses in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2014, our accumulated deficit was $83.2 million. We anticipate that our operating expenses will increase in the foreseeable future as we seek to continue to grow our business, attract borrowers, investors and partners and further enhance and develop our loan products, marketplace and platform. These efforts may prove more expensive than we currently anticipate, and we may not succeed in increasing our revenue sufficiently to offset these higher expenses. We may incur additional net losses in the future and may not maintain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis.\nIf we are unable to maintain or increase loan originations facilitated through our marketplace or if existing borrowers or investors do not continue to participate on our marketplace, our business and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nWe have experienced rapid revenue and origination growth through our marketplace in recent periods with originations totaling $4.4 billion and $2.1 billion for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. To continue to grow our business, we must continue to increase loan originations through our marketplace by attracting a large number of new borrowers who meet our platform\u2019s lending standards and new and existing investors interested in investing in these loans. The number of unique borrowers on our marketplace increased over the prior year by 116%, 151% and 125% for the years ending December 31, 2014 and 2013 and nine months ended December 31, 2012, respectively. The number of unique investors on our marketplace increased over the prior year by 28%, 44% and 37% for the years ending December 31, 2014 and 2013 and the nine months ended December 31, 2012, respectively. There can be no assurance that this increase in the number of unique borrowers and investors will continue to increase. Furthermore, we have experienced a high number of inquiries from potential borrowers who do not meet the criteria for loan application approval. If there are not sufficient qualified loan requests, investors may be unable to deploy their capital in a timely or efficient manner and may seek other investment opportunities. If there are insufficient investor commitments, borrowers may be unable to obtain investment capital for their loans and may stop using our marketplace for their borrowing needs.\nA relatively small number of investors account for a large dollar amount of investment in loans funded through our marketplace.\nA relatively small number of investors account for a large dollar amount of investment in loans funded through our marketplace. Although we believe there is substantial excess investor demand to replace any investors who may choose not to continue to invest through our marketplace, if we are unable to attract sufficient investor commitments or investors do not continue to participate in our marketplace at the current rates, we may be unable to increase our loan originations and our revenue may grow more slowly than expected or decline over the short term. In addition, if a large number of our existing investors ceased utilizing our marketplace over a short period of time, our business could be temporarily interrupted as new investors complete the administrative and diligence updating processes necessary to enable their investments.\nIf we are unable to maintain our relationships with issuing banks, our business will suffer.\nWe rely on issuing banks to originate all loans and to comply with various federal, state and other laws. Our primary issuing bank is WebBank, a Utah-chartered industrial bank that handles a variety of consumer and commercial financing programs. Springstone Financial, LLC (Springstone), which we acquired in April 2014, relies on NBT Bank and Comenity Bank as issuing banks for its education and patient finance loans.\nOur agreements with WebBank are non-exclusive and do not prohibit WebBank from working with our competitors or from offering competing services. Our current agreements with WebBank have initial terms ending in November 2018, with the possibility of two, one-year renewal terms, subject to certain early termination provisions as set forth in the agreements. WebBank currently offers loan programs through another online marketplace. WebBank could decide that working with us is not in its interest, could make working with it cost prohibitive or could decide to enter into exclusive or more favorable relationships with our competitors. In addition, WebBank may not perform as expected under our agreements including potentially being unable to accommodate our projected growth in loan volume. We could in the future have disagreements or disputes with WebBank, which could negatively impact or threaten our relationship.\nWebBank is subject to oversight by the FDIC and the State of Utah and must comply with complex rules and regulations, licensing and examination requirements, including requirements to maintain a certain amount of regulatory capital relative to its outstanding loans. We are a service provider to WebBank, and as such, we are subject to audit by WebBank in accordance with FDIC guidance related to management of third-party vendors. We may also be subject to the examination and enforcement authority of the FDIC as a bank service company covered by the Bank Service Company Act. If WebBank were to suspend, limit or cease its operations or our relationship with WebBank were to otherwise terminate, we would need to implement a substantially similar arrangement with another issuing bank, obtain additional state licenses or curtail our operations. Although we currently have a non-exclusive arrangement with Cross River Bank, another issuing bank, to date Cross River Bank has not originated any loans through our platform. If we need to enter into alternative arrangements with a different issuing bank to replace our existing arrangements, we may not be able to negotiate a comparable alternative arrangement. Transitioning loan originations to a new issuing bank is untested and may result in delays in the issuance of loans or, if our platform becomes inoperable, may result in our inability to facilitate loans through our platform. If we were unable to enter in an alternative arrangement with a different issuing bank, we would need to obtain a state license in each state in which we operate to enable us to originate loans, as well as comply with other state and federal laws, which would be costly and time-consuming. If we are unsuccessful in maintaining our relationships with WebBank or other issuing banks, our ability to provide loan products could be materially impaired and our operating results would suffer.\nOur quarterly results may fluctuate significantly and may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business.\nOur quarterly results of operations, including the levels of our operating revenue and expenses, contribution margin and other key metrics, may vary significantly in the future and period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful. Accordingly, the results for any one quarter are not necessarily an indication of future performance. Our quarterly financial results may fluctuate due to a variety of factors, some of which are outside of our control and, as a result, may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business. Fluctuation in quarterly results may adversely affect the price of our common stock. Factors that may cause fluctuations in our quarterly financial results include:\n\u2022\nour ability to attract new investors or borrowers and maintain relationships with existing borrowers and investors;\n\u2022\nloan volumes, loan grades, loan mix and the channels through which the loans and corresponding investors are sourced;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of operating expenses related to acquiring borrowers and investors and the maintenance and expansion of our business, operations and infrastructure;\n\u2022\nnetwork outages or security breaches;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic, industry and market conditions;\n\u2022\nour emphasis on borrower and investor experience instead of near-term growth; and\n\u2022\nthe timing of expenses related to the development or acquisition of technologies or businesses and potential future charges for impairment of goodwill from acquired technologies or businesses.\nIn addition, we experience some seasonality in demand for personal loans, which is generally lower in the first and fourth quarters. While our growth has somewhat masked this seasonality, our operating results could be affected by such seasonality in the future.\nIf we do not compete effectively in our target markets, our operating results could be harmed.\nThe personal and small business lending market is competitive and evolving. We compete with financial products and companies that attract borrowers, investors or both. With respect to borrowers, we primarily compete with traditional financial institutions, such as banks, credit unions, credit card issuers and other consumer finance companies. With respect to investors, we primarily compete with other investment vehicles and asset classes, such as equities, bonds and short-term fixed income securities. We also compete with other online credit marketplaces.\nMany of our competitors operate with different business models, have different cost structures or participate selectively in different market segments. They may ultimately prove more successful or more adaptable to new regulatory, technological and other developments. Some of our current or potential competitors have significantly more financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do and may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion, sale and support of their platforms and distribution channels. Our potential competitors may also have longer operating histories, more extensive customer bases, greater brand recognition and brand loyalty and broader customer and partner relationships than we have. For example, more established Internet companies that possess large, existing customer bases, substantial financial resources and established distribution channels could enter the market. Additionally, a current or potential competitor may acquire one of our existing competitors or form a strategic alliance with one of our competitors. Our competitors may be better at developing new products, responding quickly to new technologies and undertaking more extensive marketing campaigns. If we are unable to compete with such companies and meet the need for innovation in our industry, the demand for our marketplace could stagnate or substantially decline, we could experience reduced revenue or our marketplace could fail to achieve or maintain more widespread market acceptance, any of which could harm our business.\nNegative publicity could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nNegative publicity about our industry or our company, including the quality and reliability of our marketplace, effectiveness of the credit decisioning and scoring models used in the marketplace, changes to our marketplace, our ability to effectively manage and resolve borrower and investor complaints, privacy and security practices, litigation, regulatory activity and the experience of borrowers and investors with our marketplace or services, even if inaccurate, could adversely affect our reputation and the confidence in, and the use of, our marketplace, which could harm our business and operating results. Harm to our reputation can arise from many sources, including employee misconduct, misconduct by our partners, outsourced service providers or other counterparties, failure by us or our partners to meet minimum standards of service and quality, inadequate protection of borrower and investor information and compliance failures and claims.\nIf we fail to promote and maintain our brand in a cost-effective manner, we may lose market share and our revenue may decrease.\nWe believe that developing and maintaining awareness of our brand in a cost-effective manner is critical to attracting new and retaining existing borrowers and investors to our marketplace. Successful promotion of our brand will depend largely on the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and the experience of borrowers and investors in our marketplace. Our efforts to build our brand have involved significant expense, and it is likely that our future marketing efforts will require us to incur significant additional expense. These brand promotion activities may not result in increased revenue and, even if they do, any increases may not offset the expenses incurred. If we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand or if we incur substantial expenses in an unsuccessful attempt to promote and maintain our brand, we may lose our existing borrowers and investors to our competitors or be unable to attract new borrowers and investors.\nOur success and future growth depend significantly on our successful marketing efforts, and if we are unable to attract borrowers and investors to our marketplace, our business and financial results may be harmed.\nWe intend to continue to dedicate significant resources to our marketing efforts, particularly as we continue to grow our marketplace, introduce new loan products and expand into new states. Our ability to attract qualified borrowers and sufficient investors depends in large part on the success of these marketing efforts and the success of the marketing channels we use to promote our marketplace. Our marketing channels include social media and the press, online partnerships, search engine optimization, search engine marketing,\noffline partnerships, mail-to-web and radio and television advertising. If any of our current marketing channels become less effective, if we are unable to continue to use any of these channels, if the cost of using these channels were to significantly increase or if we are not successful in generating new channels, we may not be able to attract new borrowers and investors in a cost-effective manner or convert potential borrowers and investors into active borrowers and investors in our marketplace. As a result, our revenue and results of operations would be adversely affected, which may impair our ability to grow our business.\nIf new loan products and enhancements do not achieve sufficient market acceptance, our financial results and competitive position will be harmed.\nWe incur expenses and expend resources upfront to develop, acquire and market new loan products and platform enhancements to incorporate additional features, improve functionality or otherwise make our marketplace more desirable to borrowers and investors. New loan products or marketplace or platform enhancements must achieve high levels of market acceptance in order for us to recoup our investment in developing and bringing them to market.\nAny new loan products and changes to our marketplace or platform could fail to attain sufficient market acceptance for many reasons, including:\n\u2022\nour failure to predict market demand accurately and supply loan products that meet this demand in a timely fashion;\n\u2022\nborrowers and investors using our marketplace may not like, find useful or agree with any changes;\n\u2022\ndefects, errors or failures in our platform;\n\u2022\nnegative publicity about our loan products or our marketplace or platform\u2019s performance or effectiveness;\n\u2022\ndelays in releasing to the market new loan products or marketplace or platform enhancements; and\n\u2022\nthe introduction or anticipated introduction of competing products by our competitors.\nIf our new loan products or marketplace or platform enhancements do not achieve adequate acceptance in the market, our competitive position, revenue and operating results could be harmed. The adverse effect on our financial results may be particularly acute because of the significant development, marketing, sales and other expenses we will have incurred in connection with the new loan products or enhancements.\nIf we are unable to successfully expand our marketplace to new markets, we may not succeed in growing our business.\nAlthough historically we have focused on the personal loan market, we recently expanded our marketplace to include small business borrowers and have also introduced education and patient finance loans through our acquisition of Springstone. We plan to address additional markets and loan products and expand the types of borrowers and investors to further grow our business. Any failure to successfully address additional market segments and loan products or develop a broader base of borrowers and investors could result in loss of market share or slower growth, which would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSuccessful strategic relationships with ecosystem partners are important for our future success.\nWe anticipate that we will continue to depend on relationships with ecosystem partners to grow our business. Ecosystem partners can transact directly with our marketplace as investors or serve as a source of referrals for investors and borrowers. We continue to pursue additional relationships with ecosystem partners, such as banks, asset managers and insurance companies. For example, we intend to enter into strategic relationships with community banks and other financial partners to facilitate co-branded loan offerings to their borrower customers through our marketplace. Identifying, negotiating and documenting relationships with ecosystem partners require significant time and resources as does integrating third-party data and services. Our current agreements with ecosystem partners often do not prohibit them from working with our competitors or from offering competing services. Our competitors may be effective in providing incentives to ecosystem partners to favor their products or services or in reducing the volume of loans facilitated through our marketplace. In addition, these ecosystem partners may not perform as expected under our agreements with them, and we may have disagreements or disputes with such partners, which could adversely affect our brand and reputation. If we cannot successfully enter into and maintain effective strategic relationships with ecosystem partners, our business will be harmed.\nIf the credit decisioning and scoring models we use contain errors or are otherwise ineffective, our reputation and relationships with borrowers and investors could be harmed and our market share could decline.\nOur ability to attract borrowers and investors to, and build trust in, our marketplace is significantly dependent on our ability to effectively evaluate a borrower\u2019s credit profile and likelihood of default. To conduct this evaluation, we utilize credit decisioning and scoring models that assign each loan offered on our marketplace a grade and a corresponding interest rate. Our marketplace\u2019s credit decisioning and scoring models are based on algorithms that evaluate a number of factors, including behavioral data, transactional data and employment information, which may not effectively predict future loan losses. If we are unable to effectively segment borrowers into relative risk profiles, we may be unable to offer attractive interests rates for borrowers and returns for investors. We refine these algorithms based on new data and changing macro and economic conditions. If any of these credit decisioning and scoring models contain programming or other errors, are ineffective or the data provided by borrowers or third parties is incorrect or stale, our loan pricing and approval process could be negatively affected, resulting in mispriced or misclassified loans or incorrect approvals or denials of loans. While we have not incurred any material liabilities to date, if these errors were to occur in the future, investors may try to rescind their affected investments or decide not to invest in loans or borrowers may seek to revise the terms of their loans or reduce the use of our marketplace for loans.\nCredit and other information that we receive from third parties about a borrower may be inaccurate or may not accurately reflect the borrower\u2019s creditworthiness, which may cause us to inaccurately price loans facilitated through our marketplace.\nWe obtain borrower credit information from consumer reporting agencies, such as TransUnion, Experian or Equifax, and assign loan grades to loan requests based on our marketplace\u2019s credit decisioning and scoring models that take into account reported credit score, other information reported by the consumer reporting agencies and the requested loan amount, in addition to a variety of other factors. A credit score or loan grade assigned to a borrower may not reflect that borrower\u2019s actual creditworthiness because the credit score may be based on outdated, incomplete or inaccurate consumer reporting data, and we do not verify the information obtained from the borrower\u2019s credit report. Additionally, there is a risk that, following the date of the credit report that we obtain and review, a borrower may have:\n\u2022\nbecome delinquent in the payment of an outstanding obligation;\n\u2022\ndefaulted on a pre-existing debt obligation;\n\u2022\ntaken on additional debt; or\n\u2022\nsustained other adverse financial events.\nIf borrowers default on loans that are not priced correctly, investors may try to rescind their affected investments in these loans and our reputation may be harmed.\nOur reputation may be harmed if information supplied by borrowers is inaccurate, misleading or incomplete.\nBorrowers supply a variety of information that is included in the loan listings on our marketplace. Other than as described below, we do not verify this information, and it may be inaccurate or incomplete. For example, we often do not verify a borrower\u2019s stated tenure, job title, home ownership status or intention for the use of loan proceeds. Moreover, investors do not, and will not, have access to financial statements of borrowers or to other detailed financial information about borrowers. If investors invest in loans through our marketplace based on information supplied by borrowers that is inaccurate, misleading or incomplete, those investors may not receive their expected returns and our reputation may be harmed.\nFraudulent activity associated with our marketplace could negatively impact our operating results, brand and reputation and cause the use of our loan products and services to decrease and our fraud losses to increase.\nWe are subject to the risk of fraudulent activity associated with our marketplace, issuing banks, borrowers, investors and third parties handling borrower and investor information. Our resources, technologies and fraud prevention tools may be insufficient to accurately detect and prevent fraud. Under our agreements with investors, we are obligated to repurchase loans in cases of confirmed identity theft. The level of our fraud charge-offs and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if fraudulent activity were to significantly increase. High profile fraudulent activity or significant increases in fraudulent activity could lead to regulatory intervention, negatively impact our operating results, brand and reputation and lead us to take steps to reduce fraud risk, which could increase our costs.\nWe rely on data from third parties for the successful operation of our platform.\nOur ability to review and select qualified borrowers and sufficient investors depends on credit, identification, employment and other relevant information that we receive from third parties, including credit bureaus. If this information becomes unavailable or becomes more expensive to access, it could increase our costs as we seek alternative sources of information. If this third-party data is incorrect, our ability to identify qualified borrowers and investors or approve and price loans may suffer and our business may be harmed.\nFluctuations in interest rates could negatively affect transaction volume.\nAll personal and nearly all small business loans facilitated through our marketplace are issued with fixed interest rates, and education and patient finance loans facilitated by Springstone are issued with fixed or variable rates, depending on the type of loan. If interest rates rise, investors who have already committed capital may lose the opportunity to take advantage of the higher rates. Additionally, potential borrowers could seek to defer loans as they wait for interest rates to settle, and borrowers of variable rate loans through Springstone\u2019s platform may be subject to increased interest rates. If interest rates decrease after a loan is made, borrowers through our marketplace may prepay their loans to take advantage of the lower rates. Investors through our marketplace would lose the opportunity to collect the above-market interest rate payable on the corresponding loan and may delay or reduce future loan investments. As a result, fluctuations in the interest rate environment may discourage investors and borrowers from participating in our marketplace and may reduce our loan originations, which may adversely affect our business.\nIf loan default rates are in excess of the expected default rates, we may be unable to collect our entire servicing fee.\nPersonal loans facilitated through our marketplace are not secured by any collateral, not guaranteed or insured by any third party and not backed by any governmental authority in any way. We are therefore limited in our ability to collect on the loans if a borrower is unwilling or unable to repay. A borrower\u2019s ability to repay us can be negatively impacted by increases in their payment obligations to other lenders under mortgage, credit card and other loans, including student loans and home equity lines of credit. These changes can result from increases in base lending rates or structured increases in payment obligations and could reduce the ability of our borrowers to meet their payment obligations to other lenders and to us. If a borrower defaults on a loan, we typically outsource subsequent servicing efforts to third-party collection agencies, which may be unsuccessful in their efforts to collect the amount of the loan. Because our servicing fees depend on the collectability of the loans, if we experience an unexpected significant increase in the number of borrowers who fail to repay their loans or an increase in the principal amount of the loans that are not repaid, we will be unable to collect our entire servicing fee for such loans and our revenue could be adversely affected.\nIf we experience an increase in defaults on loans facilitated through our marketplace, the return on investment for investors in those loans would be adversely affected and investors may not find investing through our marketplace desirable.\nWe make payments ratably on an investor\u2019s investment only if we receive the borrower\u2019s payments on the corresponding loan. If we do not receive payments on the corresponding loan related to an investment, the investor will not be entitled to any payments under the terms of the investment. Further, investors may have to pay us an additional servicing fee of up to 35% of any amount recovered by our third-party collection agencies assigned to collect on the loan. An investor may become dissatisfied with our marketplace if a loan underlying its investment is not repaid and it does not receive full payment. As a result, our reputation may suffer and we may lose investor confidence, which could adversely affect investor participation on our marketplace.\nLimited liquidity for investments facilitated through our marketplace may make these investments less attractive to investors.\nNo trading market currently exists for the certificates issued by the Trust or for the investment funds, each of which are privately placed. Note investors can only sell their notes through the resale trading platform operated by FOLIOfn Investments, Inc. (FOLIOfn), an unaffiliated registered broker-dealer. During 2014, it took an average of approximately four days to sell a note on FOLIOfn with an offer price at or below par. We cannot assure you that FOLIOfn will continue to maintain a market for the trading of notes or that another market may arise. Given the lack of liquidity for certificates and the limited liquidity for notes, investors and potential investors may consider these investments to be less appealing and demand for these investments may decrease, which may adversely affect our business.\nBorrowers may prepay a loan at any time without penalty and investors may stop investing in loans, which could reduce our servicing or management fee revenues.\nA borrower may decide to prepay all or a portion of the remaining principal amount on a loan at any time without penalty. If the entire remaining unpaid principal amount of a loan is prepaid, we will not receive a servicing fee on the anticipated future loan payments and investors will not receive related payments. If a significant volume of prepayments occur, investors may stop investing in loans and the amount of our servicing or management fee revenues would decline, either of which could harm our business.\nOur ability to protect the confidential information of our borrowers and investors may be adversely affected by cyber-attacks, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins or similar disruptions.\nThe highly automated nature of our marketplace may make it an attractive target and potentially vulnerable to cyber attacks, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins or similar disruptions. Our marketplace processes certain sensitive data from our borrowers and investors. While we have taken steps to protect confidential information that we have access to, our security measures could be breached. Any accidental or willful security breaches or other unauthorized access to our marketplace could cause confidential\nborrower and investor information to be stolen and used for criminal purposes. Security breaches or unauthorized access to confidential information could also expose us to liability related to the loss of the information, time-consuming and expensive litigation and negative publicity. If security measures are breached because of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise, or if design flaws in our software are exposed and exploited, our relationships with borrowers and investors could be severely damaged, and we could incur significant liability.\nBecause techniques used to sabotage or obtain unauthorized access to systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until they are launched against a target, we and our third-party hosting facilities may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. In addition, federal regulators and many federal and state laws and regulations require companies to notify individuals of data security breaches involving their personal data. These mandatory disclosures regarding a security breach are costly to implement and often lead to widespread negative publicity, which may cause borrowers and investors to lose confidence in the effectiveness of our data security measures. Any security breach, whether actual or perceived, would harm our reputation, we could lose borrowers, investors and ecosystem partners and our business and operations could be adversely affected.\nAny significant disruption in service on our platform or in our computer systems, including events beyond our control, could prevent us from processing or posting payments on loans, reduce the attractiveness of our marketplace and result in a loss of borrowers or investors.\nIn the event of a platform outage and physical data loss, our ability to perform our servicing obligations, process applications or make loans available on our marketplace would be materially and adversely affected. The satisfactory performance, reliability and availability of our technology and our underlying network infrastructure are critical to our operations, customer service, reputation and our ability to attract new and retain existing borrowers and investors. Our platform systems are mirrored between two third-party owned and operated facilities. Our primary location is in Las Vegas, Nevada and is operated by Switch, Inc. Our secondary location is located in Santa Clara, California and is operated by CenturyLink. Our operations depend on both provider\u2019s ability to protect its and our systems in their facilities against damage or interruption from natural disasters, power or telecommunications failures, air quality issues, environmental conditions, computer viruses or attempts to harm our systems, criminal acts and similar events. If our arrangement with either provider is terminated or if there is a lapse of service or damage to their facilities, we could experience interruptions in our service as well as delays and additional expense in arranging new facilities.\nAny interruptions or delays in our service, whether as a result of third-party error, our error, natural disasters or security breaches, whether accidental or willful, could harm our relationships with our borrowers and investors and our reputation. Additionally, in the event of damage or interruption, our insurance policies may not adequately compensate us for any losses that we may incur. Our disaster recovery plan has not been tested under actual disaster conditions, and we may not have sufficient capacity to recover all data and services in the event of an outage. These factors could prevent us from processing or posting payments on the loans, damage our brand and reputation, divert our employees\u2019 attention, reduce our revenue, subject us to liability and cause borrowers and investors to abandon our marketplace, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is subject to the risks of earthquakes, fire, power outages, floods and other catastrophic events, and to interruption by man-made problems such as strikes and terrorism.\nA significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, fire, power outage, flood or other catastrophic event, or interruptions by strikes, terrorism or other made-made problems, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. Our headquarters and our real-time disaster recovery data center are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, a region known for seismic activity. Despite any precautions we may take, the occurrence of a natural disaster or other unanticipated problems at our data centers could result in lengthy interruptions in our services. In addition, acts of strikes, terrorism and other geo-political unrest could cause disruptions in our business and lead to interruptions, delays or loss of critical data. All of the aforementioned risks may be further increased if our disaster recovery plans prove to be inadequate. We have implemented a disaster recovery program that allows us to move production to a back-up data center in the event of a catastrophe. Although this program is functional, we do not currently serve network traffic equally from each data center. If our primary data center shuts down, there will be a period of time that our loan products or services, or certain of our loan products or services, will remain inaccessible to our users or our users may experience severe issues accessing our loan products and services.\nWe do not currently maintain business interruption insurance to compensate us for potentially significant losses, including potential harm to our business that may result from interruptions in our ability to provide our loan products and services.\nOur platform and internal systems rely on software that is highly technical, and if it contains undetected errors, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur platform and internal systems rely on software that is highly technical and complex. In addition, our platform and internal systems depend on the ability of such software to store, retrieve, process and manage immense amounts of data. The software on which we rely has contained, and may now or in the future contain, undetected errors or bugs. Some errors may only be discovered after the code has been released for external or internal use. Errors or other design defects within the software on which we rely may result in a\nnegative experience for borrowers and investors, delay introductions of new features or enhancements, result in errors or compromise our ability to protect borrower or investor data or our intellectual property. Any errors, bugs or defects discovered in the software on which we rely could result in harm to our reputation, loss of borrowers or investors, loss of revenue or liability for damages, any of which could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nBecause some investors may come to our website via hyperlinks from websites of referral partners, it is possible that an unsatisfied investor could make a claim against us based on the content of these third-party websites that could result in claims that are costly to defend and distracting to management.\nSome investors in notes may come to our website after reviewing the website of a referral partner via a hyperlink from this third-party website to a landing page on our website. We compensate referral partners based on whether a person \u201cclicks through\u201d to our web page, and do not pay any compensation based on whether or how much an investor may invest. While all investors are provided with access to a note prospectus on the landing page and during the account opening process, it is possible that an investor could have reviewed additional content on the referral partner\u2019s website. We do not review, approve or adopt any content on a referral partner\u2019s website and, while we do not believe we would have liability for content on a partner website, it is possible that an unsatisfied investor could bring claims against us based on such content. Such claims could be costly and time consuming to defend and would distract management\u2019s attention from the operation of the business.\nMisconduct and errors by our employees and third-party service providers could harm our business and reputation.\nWe are exposed to many types of operational risk, including the risk of misconduct and errors by our employees and other third-party service providers. Our business depends on our employees and third-party service providers to process a large number of increasingly complex transactions, including treasury transactions that involve significant dollar amounts and loan transactions that involve the use and disclosure of personal and business information. We could be materially adversely affected if treasury transactions were redirected, misappropriated or otherwise improperly executed, personal and business information was disclosed to unintended recipients or an operational breakdown or failure in the processing of other transactions occurred, whether as a result of human error, a purposeful sabotage or a fraudulent manipulation of our operations or systems. In addition, the manner in which we store and use certain personal information and interact with borrowers and investors is governed by various federal and state laws. If any of our employees or third-party service providers take, convert or misuse funds, documents or data or fail to follow protocol when interacting with borrowers and investors, we could be liable for damages and subject to regulatory actions and penalties. We could also be perceived to have facilitated or participated in the illegal misappropriation of funds, documents or data, or the failure to follow protocol, and therefore be subject to civil or criminal liability. It is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct or errors by employees or third-party service providers, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses. Any of these occurrences could result in our diminished ability to operate our business, potential liability to borrowers and investors, inability to attract future borrowers and investors, reputational damage, regulatory intervention and financial harm, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights, which could harm our business.\nOur success depends on not infringing on the intellectual property rights of others. Our competitors, as well as a number of other entities and individuals, may own or claim to own intellectual property relating to our industry. From time to time, third parties may claim that we are infringing on their intellectual property rights, and we may be found to be infringing on such rights. In the future, others may claim that our applications and underlying technology infringe or violate their intellectual property rights. We may, however, be unaware of the intellectual property rights that others may claim cover some or all of our technology or services. Any claims or litigation could cause us to incur significant expenses and, if successfully asserted against us, could require that we pay substantial damages or ongoing royalty payments, prevent us from offering our loan products or operating our platform or require that we comply with other unfavorable terms. We may also be obligated to indemnify parties or pay substantial settlement costs, including royalty payments, in connection with any such claim or litigation and to obtain licenses, modify applications or refund fees, which could be costly. Even if we were to prevail in such a dispute, any litigation regarding our intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming and divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations.\nAny failure to protect our own intellectual property rights could impair our brand, negatively impact our business or both.\nOur success and ability to compete also depend in part on protecting our own intellectual property. We rely on a combination of copyright, trade secret, trademark and other rights, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology, processes and other intellectual property. However, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property rights may be inadequate. Third parties may seek to challenge, invalidate or circumvent our copyright, trade secret, trademark and other rights or applications for any of the foregoing. In order to protect our intellectual property rights, we may be required to spend significant resources. Litigation brought to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly, time-consuming and distracting to management and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property. Our failure to secure, protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could seriously adversely affect our brand and adversely impact our business.\nSome aspects of our platform include open source software, and any failure to comply with the terms of one or more of these open source licenses could negatively affect our business.\nAspects of our platform include software covered by open source licenses, which may include, by way of example, GNU General Public License and the Apache License. The terms of various open source licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. courts, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our platform. If portions of our proprietary software are determined to be subject to an open source license, we could be required to publicly release the affected portions of our source code, re-engineer all or a portion of our technologies or otherwise be limited in the licensing of our technologies, each of which could reduce or eliminate the value of our technologies and loan products. In addition to risks related to license requirements, usage of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the origin of the software. Many of the risks associated with use of open source software cannot be eliminated, and could adversely affect our business.\nIf we fail to manage the integration of Springstone effectively, our results of operations and business could be harmed.\nWe are in the process of integrating Springstone into our business. Risks associated with any such integration include:\n\u2022\nour inability to integrate smoothly Springstone\u2019s technologies and loan products with our current technologies and products;\n\u2022\npossible changes to Springstone\u2019s loan products and sales and operational processes; and\n\u2022\nour inability to assimilate and retain the management and other personnel, culture and operations of Springstone, including back-office functions and systems, such as accounting, human resources, internal controls and others.\nThis integration may be difficult and unpredictable. We may invest resources in the acquisition and integration efforts would have been better utilized developing technology and loan products for our marketplace or on other strategic development initiatives.\nFurther, this acquisition may disrupt our ongoing operations, divert management\u2019s attention from their primary responsibilities and our other strategic initiatives, subject us to additional liabilities, increase our expenses and otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nFrom time to time we may evaluate and potentially consummate acquisitions, which could require significant management attention, disrupt our business and adversely affect our financial results.\nWe may evaluate and consider strategic transactions, combinations, acquisitions or alliances to enhance our existing business or develop new loan products and services. These transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations if consummated. If we are able to identify an appropriate business opportunity, we may not be able to successfully consummate the transaction and, even if we do consummate such a transaction, we may be unable to obtain the benefits or avoid the difficulties and risks of such transaction.\nAny acquisition will involve risks commonly encountered in business relationships, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in assimilating and integrating the operations, personnel, systems, data, technologies, products and services of the acquired business;\n\u2022\ninability of the acquired technologies, products or businesses to achieve expected levels of revenue, profitability, productivity or other benefits;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in retaining, training, motivating and integrating key personnel;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s time and resources from our normal daily operations;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in successfully incorporating licensed or acquired technology and rights into our platform;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies within the combined organizations;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in retaining relationships with customers, employees and suppliers of the acquired business;\n\u2022\nrisks of entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience;\n\u2022\nregulatory risks, including remaining in good standing with existing regulatory bodies or receiving any necessary pre-closing or post-closing approvals, as well as being subject to new regulators with oversight over an acquired business;\n\u2022\nassumption of contractual obligations that contain terms that are not beneficial to us, require us to license or waive intellectual property rights or increase our risk for liability;\n\u2022\nfailure to successfully further develop the acquired technology;\n\u2022\nliability for activities of the acquired business before the acquisition, including patent and trademark infringement claims, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities and other known and unknown liabilities;\n\u2022\npotential disruptions to our ongoing businesses; and\n\u2022\nunexpected costs and unknown risks and liabilities associated with the acquisition.\nWe may not make any acquisitions, or any future acquisitions may not be successful, may not benefit our business strategy, may not generate sufficient revenue to offset the associated acquisition costs or may not otherwise result in the intended benefits. In addition, we cannot assure you that any future acquisition of new businesses or technology will lead to the successful development of new or enhanced loan products and services or that any new or enhanced loan products and services, if developed, will achieve market acceptance or prove to be profitable.\nExpanding our operations internationally could subject us to new challenges and risks.\nAlthough we currently only operate in the United States, we may seek to expand our business internationally. Managing any international expansion will require additional resources and controls. Any expansion internationally could subject our business to risks associated with international operations, including:\n\u2022\nadjusting the proprietary risk algorithms that we use to account for the differences in information available on borrowers;\n\u2022\nconformity with applicable business customs, including translation into foreign languages and associated expenses;\n\u2022\npotential changes to our established business model;\n\u2022\nthe need to support and integrate with local third-party service providers;\n\u2022\ncompetition with service providers that have greater experience in the local markets than we do or that have pre-existing relationships with potential borrowers and investors in those markets;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations in an environment of diverse culture, laws and customers, and the increased travel, infrastructure and legal and compliance costs associated with international operations;\n\u2022\ncompliance with multiple, potentially conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations, including banking, securities, employment, tax, privacy and data protection laws and regulations, such as the EU Data Privacy Directive;\n\u2022\ncompliance with U.S. and foreign anti-bribery laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Anti-Bribery Act;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in collecting payments in foreign currencies and associated foreign currency exposure;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on repatriation of earnings;\n\u2022\ncompliance with potentially conflicting and changing laws of taxing jurisdictions where we conduct business and applicable U.S. tax laws as they relate to international operations, the complexity and adverse consequences of such tax laws and potentially adverse tax consequences due to changes in such tax laws; and\n\u2022\nregional economic and political conditions.\nAs a result of these risks, any potential future international expansion efforts that we may undertake may not be successful.\nWe have in the past incurred substantial debt and may issue debt securities or otherwise incur substantial debt in the future, which may adversely affect our financial condition and negatively impact our operations.\nWe have in the past incurred, and may in the future incur, substantial debt. The incurrence of debt could have a variety of negative effects, including:\n\u2022\ndefault and foreclosure on our assets if our operating revenue is insufficient to repay debt obligations;\n\u2022\nacceleration of obligations to repay the indebtedness (or other outstanding indebtedness), even if we make all principal and interest payments when due, if we breach any covenants that require the maintenance of certain financial ratios or reserves without a waiver or renegotiation of that covenant;\n\u2022\nour inability to obtain necessary additional financing if the debt security contains covenants restricting our ability to obtain such financing while the debt security is outstanding;\n\u2022\ndiverting a substantial portion of cash flow to pay principal and interest on such debt, which would reduce the funds available for expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes; and\n\u2022\ncreating potential limitations on our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business and in the industry in which we operate.\nThe occurrence of any of these risks could adversely affect our operations or financial condition.\nCompetition for our employees is intense, and we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled employees needed to support our business.\nWe believe our success depends on the efforts and talents of our employees, including software engineers, financial personnel and marketing professionals. Our future success depends on our continued ability to attract, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified and skilled employees. Competition for highly skilled technical and financial personnel, particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area, is extremely intense. We may not be able to hire and retain these personnel at compensation levels consistent with our existing compensation and salary structure. Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced employees have greater resources than we have and may be able to offer more attractive terms of employment.\nIn addition, we invest significant time and expense in training our employees, which increases their value to competitors who may seek to recruit them. If we fail to retain our employees, we could incur significant expenses in hiring and training their replacements, and the quality of our services and our ability to serve borrowers and investors could diminish, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf we fail to retain our key personnel, we may not be able to achieve our anticipated level of growth and our business could suffer.\nIn addition to attracting and retaining highly skilled employees in general, our future performance depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain key personnel, including our executive officers, senior management team and other key personnel, all of whom would be difficult to replace. In particular, Mr. Laplanche, our founder and Chief Executive Officer, is critical to the management of our business and operations and the development of our strategic direction. The loss of the services of Mr. Laplanche, our other executive officers or members of our senior management team, and the process to replace any of them, would involve significant time and expense and may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives.\nIf we cannot maintain our corporate culture as we grow, we could lose the innovation, collaboration and focus that contribute to our business.\nWe believe that a critical component of our success is our corporate culture, which we believe fosters innovation, encourages teamwork and cultivates creativity. As we develop the infrastructure of a public company and continue to grow, we may find it difficult to maintain these valuable aspects of our corporate culture. Any failure to preserve our culture could negatively impact our future success, including our ability to attract and retain employees, encourage innovation and teamwork and effectively focus on and pursue our corporate objectives.\nIf we discover a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting that we are unable to remedy or otherwise fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures, our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis and the market price of our common stock may be adversely affected.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley Act) requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. Although we did not discover any material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting at December 31, 2014, subsequent testing by us or our independent registered public accounting firm, which has not performed an audit of our internal control over financial reporting, may reveal deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses. To comply with Section 404A and 404B, we may incur substantial cost, expend significant management time on compliance-related issues and hire additional accounting, financial and internal audit staff with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge. Moreover, if we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404A and 404B in a timely manner or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources. Any failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results, and cause a decline in the price of our common stock.\nOur ability to use our deferred tax assets to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations that could subject our business to higher tax liabilities.\nWe may be limited in the portion of net operating loss carryforwards that we can use in the future to offset taxable income for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes. At December 31, 2014, we had federal and state net operating loss carry-forwards (\u201cNOLs\u201d) of approximately $68.7 million and $61.5 million, respectively, to offset future taxable income. These federal and state net operating loss carry-forwards will begin expiring in 2027 and 2016, respectively. A lack of future taxable income would adversely affect our ability to utilize these NOLs. In addition, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (\u201cCode\u201d), a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its NOLs to offset future taxable income. Future changes in our stock ownership as well as other changes that may be outside of our control, could result in additional ownership changes under Section 382 of the Code. Our NOLs may also be impaired under similar provisions of state law. Additionally, at December 31, 2014, we had federal and state research and development tax credit carry-forwards of approximately $0.3 million and $0.2 million, respectively. We assess the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to utilize the existing deferred tax assets. On the basis of this evaluation, a full valuation allowance has historically been recorded to recognize only deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realized. Our deferred tax assets may expire unutilized or underutilized, which could prevent us from offsetting future taxable income.\nRISKS RELATING TO COMPLIANCE AND REGULATION\nWe and our issuing bank partners are subject to borrower protection laws and federal and state consumer protection laws.\nWe and our issuing bank partners must comply with regulatory regimes, including those applicable to consumer credit transactions, various aspects of which are untested as applied to our marketplace. Certain state laws generally regulate interest rates and other charges and require certain disclosures. In addition, other federal and state laws may apply to the origination and servicing of loans facilitated through our marketplace. In particular, through our marketplace, we may be subject to laws, such as:\n\u2022\nstate laws and regulations that impose requirements related to loan disclosures and terms, credit discrimination, credit reporting, debt servicing and collection and unfair or deceptive business practices;\n\u2022\nthe Truth-in-Lending Act and Regulation Z promulgated thereunder, and similar state laws, which require certain disclosures to borrowers regarding the terms and conditions of their loans and credit transactions;\n\u2022\nSection 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, which prohibits unfair and deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce, and Section 1031 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which prohibits unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices in connection with any consumer financial product or service;\n\u2022\nthe Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B promulgated thereunder, which prohibit creditors from discriminating against credit applicants on the basis of race, color, sex, age, religion, national origin, marital status, the fact that all or part of the applicant\u2019s income derives from any public assistance program or the fact that the applicant has in good faith exercised any right under the federal Consumer Credit Protection Act or any applicable state law;\n\u2022\nthe Fair Credit Reporting Act, as amended by the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, which promotes the accuracy, fairness and privacy of information in the files of consumer reporting agencies;\n\u2022\nthe Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and similar state debt collection laws, which provide guidelines and limitations on the conduct of third-party debt collectors in connection with the collection of consumer debts;\n\u2022\nthe Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which includes limitations on financial institutions\u2019 disclosure of nonpublic personal information about a consumer to nonaffiliated third parties, in certain circumstances requires financial institutions to limit the use and further disclosure of nonpublic personal information by nonaffiliated third parties to whom they disclose such information and requires financial institutions to disclose certain privacy policies and practices with respect to information sharing with affiliated and nonaffiliated entities as well as to safeguard personal customer information, and other privacy laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nthe Bankruptcy Code, which limits the extent to which creditors may seek to enforce debts against parties who have filed for bankruptcy protection;\n\u2022\nthe Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, which allows military members to suspend or postpone certain civil obligations so that the military member can devote his or her full attention to military duties;\n\u2022\nthe Electronic Fund Transfer Act and Regulation E promulgated thereunder, which provide disclosure requirements, guidelines and restrictions on the electronic transfer of funds from consumers\u2019 bank accounts;\n\u2022\nthe Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act and similar state laws, particularly the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act, which authorize the creation of legally binding and enforceable agreements utilizing electronic records and signatures; and\n\u2022\nthe Bank Secrecy Act, which relates to compliance with anti-money laundering, customer due diligence and record-keeping policies and procedures.\nWe may not always have been, and may not always be, in compliance with these laws. Compliance with these laws is also costly, time-consuming and limits our operational flexibility.\nFailure to comply with these laws and regulatory requirements applicable to our business may, among other things, limit our or a collection agency\u2019s ability to collect all or part of the principal of or interest on loans. As a result, we may not be able to collect our servicing fee with respect to the uncollected principal or interest, and investors may be discouraged from investing in loans. In addition, non-compliance could subject us to damages, revocation of required licenses, class action lawsuits, administrative enforcement actions, rescission rights held by investors in securities offerings and civil and criminal liability, which may harm our business and our ability to maintain our marketplace and may result in borrowers rescinding their loans.\nWhere applicable, we will seek to comply with state small loan, loan broker, servicing and similar statutes. Currently, we do not facilitate loans to borrowers in Idaho, Iowa, Maine, Nebraska and North Dakota. In all other U.S. jurisdictions with licensing or other requirements that we believe may be applicable to us, we comply with the relevant requirements through the operation of our marketplace with issuing banks or we will be seeking to obtain required licenses. Nevertheless, if we are found to not have complied with applicable laws, we could lose one or more of our licenses or authorizations or face other sanctions or penalties or be required to obtain a license in such jurisdiction, which may have an adverse effect on our ability to continue to facilitate loans through our marketplace, perform our servicing obligations or make our marketplace available to borrowers in particular states, which may harm our business.\nIf our marketplace was found to violate a state\u2019s usury laws, we may have to alter our business model and our business could be harmed.\nThe interest rates that are charged to borrowers and that form the basis of payments to investors through our marketplace are based upon the ability under federal law of the issuing bank that originates the loan to export the interest rates of its jurisdiction of incorporation to provide uniform rates to all borrowers in all states that have not opted out. WebBank, our primary issuing bank, exports the interest rates of Utah, which allows parties to generally agree by contract to any interest rate. The annual percentage rates offered by WebBank through our marketplace for personal loans as of December 31, 2014 range from 6.78% to 29.99%, which equate to interest rates for investors that range from 6.03% to 26.06%. Of the forty-six jurisdictions whose residents may obtain loans (including the District of Columbia), certain states, including Utah, have no statutory interest rate limitations on personal loans, while other jurisdictions have a maximum rate less than the current maximum rate offered by WebBank through our platform. If a borrower were to successfully bring claims against us for state usury law violations, and the rate on that borrower\u2019s personal loan was greater than that allowed under applicable state law, we could be subject to fines and penalties. Further, if we were unable to partner with another issuing bank, we would have to substantially modify our business operations from the manner currently contemplated and would be required to maintain state-specific licenses and only provide a limited range of interest rates for personal loans, all of which would substantially reduce our operating efficiency and attractiveness to investors and possibly result in a decline in our operating results.\nSeveral lawsuits have sought to re-characterize certain loan marketers and other originators as lenders. If litigation on similar theories were successful against us, loans facilitated through our marketplace could be subject to state consumer protection laws in a greater number of states.\nSeveral lawsuits have brought under scrutiny the association between high-interest \u201cpayday loan\u201d marketers and out-of-state banks. These lawsuits assert that payday loan marketers use out-of-state lenders in order to evade the consumer protection laws imposed by the states where they do business. Such litigation has sought to re-characterize the loan marketer as the lender for purposes of state consumer protection law and usury restrictions. Similar civil actions have been brought in the context of gift cards and retail purchase finance. Although we believe that our activities are generally distinguishable from the activities involved in these cases, a court or regulatory authority could disagree.\nAdditional state consumer protection laws would be applicable to the loans facilitated through our marketplace if we were re-characterized as a lender, and the loans could be voidable or unenforceable. In addition, we could be subject to claims by borrowers, as well as enforcement actions by regulators. Even if we were not required to cease doing business with residents of certain states or to change our business practices to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could be required to register or obtain licenses or regulatory approvals that could impose a substantial cost on us.\nThe increased scrutiny of third-party medical financing by governmental agencies may lead to increased regulatory burdens on Springstone and adversely affect our consolidated revenue or results of operations.\nSpringstone, through its issuing bank partners, provides education and patient finance loans, including loans for elective medical procedures. Recently, regulators increased scrutiny of third-party providers of financing for medical procedures that are generally not covered by health insurance. For example, in December 2013, the CFPB fined GE Capital Retail Bank $34.1 million for insufficient training, disclosures and practices related to their medical financing services. In addition, attorneys general in New York and Minnesota have conducted investigations on alleged abusive lending practices or exploitation regarding third-party medical financing services.\nIn June 2014, Springstone received a civil investigative demand from the CFPB for documents and other tangible items related to its programs that provide healthcare financing. If Springstone\u2019s practices are ultimately found to be deficient, resulting in fines, penalties or increased burdens on Springstone\u2019s activities, our consolidated operating costs could increase. Additionally, such regulatory inquiries or actions could damage Springstone\u2019s and our reputations and limit Springstone\u2019s ability to conduct operations, which could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements.\nThe adoption of any law, rule or regulation affecting this industry may also increase Springstone\u2019s administrative costs, modify its practices to comply with applicable requirements and reduce its ability to participate competitively, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated revenue or results of operations.\nThe CFPB is a new agency, and there continues to be uncertainty as to how the agency\u2019s actions or the actions of any other new agency could impact our business or that of our issuing banks.\nThe CFPB, which commenced operations in July 2011, has broad authority over the businesses in which we engage. This includes authority to write regulations under federal consumer financial protection laws, such as the Truth in Lending Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and to enforce those laws against and examine large financial institutions, such as our issuing banks, for compliance. The CFPB is authorized to prevent \u201cunfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices\u201d through its regulatory, supervisory and enforcement authority. To assist in its enforcement, the CFPB maintains an online complaint system that allows consumers to log complaints with respect to various consumer finance products, including the loan products we facilitate. This system could inform future CFPB decisions with respect to its regulatory, enforcement or examination focus.\nWe are subject to the CFPB\u2019s jurisdiction, including its enforcement authority, as a servicer and acquirer of consumer credit. The CFPB may request reports concerning our organization, business conduct, markets and activities. The CFPB may also conduct on-site examinations of our business on a periodic basis if the CFPB were to determine, through its complaint system, that we were engaging in activities that pose risks to consumers.\nThere continues to be uncertainty as to how the CFPB\u2019s strategies and priorities, including in both its examination and enforcement processes, will impact our businesses and our results of operations going forward. Actions by the CFPB could result in requirements to alter or cease offering affected loan products and services, making them less attractive and restricting our ability to offer them.\nAlthough we have committed resources to enhancing our compliance programs, actions by the CFPB or other regulators against us, our issuing banks or our competitors that discourage the use of the marketplace model or suggest to consumers the desirability of other loan products or services could result in reputational harm and a loss of borrowers or investors. Our compliance costs and litigation exposure could increase materially if the CFPB or other regulators enact new regulations, change regulations that were previously adopted, modify, through supervision or enforcement, past regulatory guidance, or interpret existing regulations in a manner different or stricter than have been previously interpreted.\nThe collection, processing, storage, use and disclosure of personal data could give rise to liabilities as a result of governmental regulation, conflicting legal requirements or differing views of personal privacy rights.\nWe receive, transmit and store a large volume of personally identifiable information and other user data. There are federal, state and foreign laws regarding privacy and the storing, sharing, use, disclosure and protection of personally identifiable information and user data. Specifically, personally identifiable information is increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in numerous U.S. and international jurisdictions, the intent of which is to protect the privacy of personal information that is collected, processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction. This regulatory framework for privacy issues worldwide is currently evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. We could be adversely affected if legislation or regulations are expanded to require changes in business practices or privacy policies, or if governing jurisdictions interpret or implement their legislation or regulations in ways that negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur failure to comply with applicable privacy policies or federal, state or foreign laws and regulations or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release of personally identifiable information or other user data could damage our reputation, discourage potential borrowers or investors from using our marketplace or result in fines or proceedings brought against us, our issuing banks or other third parties by governmental agencies, borrowers, investors or other third parties, one or all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition to laws, regulations and other applicable common law rules regarding privacy and privacy advocacy, industry groups or other private parties may propose new and different privacy standards. We could also be subject to liability for the inappropriate use of information made available by us. Because the interpretation and application of privacy and data protection laws and privacy standards are still uncertain, it is possible that these laws or privacy standards may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our practices. Any inability to adequately address privacy concerns, even if unfounded, or to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws, regulations and privacy standards, could result in additional cost and liability for us, damage our reputation, inhibit use of our marketplace and harm our business.\nWe will incur significantly increased costs and devote substantial management time as a result of the listing of our common stock.\nAlthough we have been a reporting company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (\u201cExchange Act\u201d), since 2008, we will incur additional legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private reporting company. For example, we are required to comply with additional requirements of the rules and regulations of the SEC and requirements of the New York Stock Exchange, including applicable corporate governance practices. We expect that compliance with these requirements will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time consuming and costly. In addition, we expect that our management and other personnel will need to divert attention from operational and other business matters to devote substantial time to these public company requirements. We cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur as a result of becoming a public company or the timing of such costs.\nIn addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time-consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to their application and practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be adversely affected.\nOur ability to offer our notes depends upon our compliance with requirements under federal or state securities laws.\nAll notes publicly offered through our marketplace are offered and sold pursuant to a registration statement filed with the SEC. We also qualify as a \u201cwell-known seasoned issuer,\u201d which allows us to file automatically effective registration statements with the SEC. Under SEC rules, for certain material updates, we must file post-effective amendments, which, if we do not qualify as a \u201cwell-known seasoned issuer,\u201d do not become effective until declared effective by the SEC. We may fail to maintain our \u201cwell-known seasoned issuer\u201d status if we do not file SEC reports on a timely manner or for other reasons. In addition, if we fail to file our Annual Reports on Form 10-K or quarterly reports on Form 10-Q on a timely basis or are otherwise required to suspend use of a registration statement for the notes, we could be required to suspend offering of our notes until the deficiency is resolved. Because we offer notes on a continuous basis, securities law restrictions may also limit our ability to market or advertise to potential investors.\nWe are also currently required to register or qualify for an exemption in every state in which we offer securities. Qualification in a state can be a time-consuming process, often requiring periodic renewals. Failure to timely renew these registrations may require us to pay penalties, suspend further offerings until we regain compliance and make rescission offers in connection with previously completed investments.\nCertain states in which we offer notes also impose special suitability standards and other conditions for operation in their states, restricting the persons and conditions under which we may make offerings in these states. We do not offer our notes in all states due to the restrictions of certain states. While we believe that following the completion of our initial public offering (IPO) we may now rely on federal preemption of state registration and qualification requirements, states may interpret federal law as applied to our notes differently, possibly requiring us to continue to make filings in or limit operations in those states. Regardless of any such registration, qualification or preemption, we are subject to both state and federal antifraud rules of each state in which we operate.\nAs a result of these requirements, actual or alleged non-compliance with federal or state laws or changes in federal or state law or regulatory policy or could limit our ability to offer notes in certain states, require us to pay fines or penalties, or curtail our operations.\nWe may have to constrain our business activities to avoid being deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940.\nIn general, a company that is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities may be deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (\u201cInvestment Company Act\u201d). The Investment Company Act contains substantive legal requirements that regulate the manner in which \u201cinvestment companies\u201d are permitted to conduct their business activities. We believe we have conducted, and we intend to continue to conduct, our business in a manner that does not result in our company being characterized as an investment company. To avoid being deemed an investment company, we may not be able to broaden our offerings, which could require us to forego attractive opportunities. We may also apply for formal exemptive relief to provide additional clarity on our status under the Investment Company Act. We may not receive such relief on a timely basis, if at all, and such relief may require us to modify or curtail our operations. If we are deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act, we may be required to institute burdensome compliance requirements and our activities may be restricted, which would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our registered investment advisor, LC Advisors, LLC, were found to have violated the Investment Advisers Act, our ability to raise sufficient investor commitments to meet borrower demand could be impaired.\nOur subsidiary LCA acts as an advisor to certain private funds and accredited investors, including those that invest in managed accounts that rely on a third-party adviser or manager to manage their investment through our marketplace. Registered investment advisers are subject to a number of regulatory and legal requirements, including conflicts of interest, advertising restrictions and custody requirements. We believe we have conducted, and we intend to continue to conduct, the business of LCA in substantial compliance with the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (\u201cInvestment Advisers Act\u201d) and applicable fiduciary duties. If, however, we are deemed to have breached any of our obligations under the Investment Advisers Act, the activities of LCA could be restricted, suspended or even terminated. If this were to occur, our ability to provide investors with the opportunity to invest through managed accounts could be severely curtailed, and we may not be able to sufficiently meet borrower and investor demand for loans, which could harm our business.\nIf we were required to register as a broker-dealer under federal or state law, our costs could significantly increase or our operations could be impaired.\nThe securities offered to investors are offered directly by us. We do not operate as a registered broker-dealer in any jurisdiction. Although we do not believe we are obligated to do so, if a regulatory body were to find that our activities require us to register as a broker-dealer or to sell the investment securities only through a registered broker-dealer, we could be subject to fines, rescission offers or other penalties, and our compliance costs and other costs of operation could increase significantly. Further, our ability to issue and distribute the securities could be significantly impaired or curtailed.\nBecause we may have issued stock options and underlying shares of common stock in violation of federal and state securities laws, we may be required to offer to repurchase those securities and incur other costs.\nWe have been a reporting company under the Exchange Act since October 2008. As a result, subsequent to that time, we were no longer entitled to rely on the exemption provided under Rule 701 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (Securities Act), and other exemptions from state securities laws for grants of certain equity awards to, and exercises of such awards by, some of our employees, directors and consultants. Therefore, it is possible that some current or former employees, directors and consultants could assert that the options and issuance of shares prior to filing our Form S-8 in July 2014 may have violated U.S. federal and state securities laws, and that such persons could have the right to require us to repurchase those securities.\nIn connection with such issuances of options and shares, we were recently required by the California Department of Business Oversight (\u201cDepartment\u201d) to undertake a rescission offer in accordance with applicable California securities laws to (i) grantees of options to purchase shares of common stock and (ii) to stockholders who acquired their shares of common stock upon exercise of stock options, each during the past two years. We will register this rescission offer on a separate registration statement on Form S-1. Eligible participants in this rescission offer might not accept our offer. The weighted average option exercise price for eligible option grants in respect of 39,480,568 shares was $3.68 per share, and the weighted average purchase price for sales of 3,593,295 shares was $0.79 per share. As it is unclear if a rescission offer under federal securities laws will terminate a purchaser\u2019s right to rescind a transaction that was not registered or exempt from such registration requirements, we may be required to honor such rescission rights in future periods. Our aggregate liability may be up to $31.9 million. We believe that any remedies a person might have after the rescission offer expires would not be greater than the amount that person would have received in the rescission offer.\nWe have not reviewed our compliance with foreign laws regarding the participation of non-U.S. residents on our marketplace.\nFrom time to time, non-U.S. residents invest in loans directly through our marketplace. Through December 31, 2014, the percentage of notes purchased (based upon dollar amounts) by such persons since inception was less than 2% of all loans issued. We are not experts with respect to all applicable laws in the various foreign jurisdictions, and we cannot be sure that we are complying with applicable foreign laws. Failure to comply with such laws could result in fines and penalties payable by us, which could reduce our profitability or cause us to modify or delay planned expansions and expenditures, including investments in our growth. In addition, any such fines and penalties could create negative publicity, result in additional regulatory oversight that could limit our operations and ability to succeed, or otherwise hinder our plans to expand our business internationally.\nRecent legislative and regulatory initiatives have imposed restrictions and requirements on financial institutions that could have an adverse effect on our business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act and other legislation and regulations relating to financial institutions and markets, including alternative asset management funds, has resulted in increased oversight and taxation. There has been, and may continue to be, a related increase in regulatory investigations of the trading and other investment activities of alternative investment funds. Such investigations may impose additional expenses by us, may require the attention of senior management and may result in fines if any of our funds are deemed to have violated any regulations.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act is extensive and significant legislation enacting changes that broadly affect most aspects of the financial services industry. The Dodd-Frank Act, among other things:\n\u2022\ncreated a liquidation framework under which the FDIC may be appointed as receiver following a \u201csystemic risk determination\u201d by the Secretary of Treasury (in consultation with the President) for the resolution of certain nonbank financial companies and other entities, defined as \u201ccovered financial companies,\u201d and commonly referred to as \u201csystemically important entities,\u201d in the event such a company is in default or in danger of default and the resolution of such a company under other applicable law would have serious adverse effects on financial stability in the United States, and also for the resolution of certain of their subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nstrengthened the regulatory oversight of securities and capital markets activities by the SEC; and\n\u2022\nincreased regulation of the securitization markets through, among other things, a mandated risk retention requirement for securitizers, which, if applied to our business, would change our business model, and a direction to the SEC to regulate credit rating agencies and adopt regulations governing these organizations and their activities.\nWith respect to the new liquidation framework for systemically important entities, we cannot assure you that such framework would not apply to us. Guidance from the FDIC indicates that such new framework will largely be exercised in a manner consistent with the existing bankruptcy laws, which is the insolvency regime that would otherwise apply to us. The SEC has proposed significant changes to the rules applicable to issuers and sponsors of asset-backed securities under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. With the proposed changes, our access to the asset-backed securities capital markets could be affected and our financing programs could be less effective. Compliance with such legislation or regulation may significantly increase our costs, limit our product offerings and operating flexibility, require significant adjustments in our internal business processes and potentially require us to maintain our regulatory capital at levels above historical practices.\nAs the regulatory framework for our business evolves, federal and state governments may draft and propose new laws to regulate online marketplaces such as ours, which may negatively affect our business.\nThe regulatory framework for Internet commerce, including online marketplaces such as ours, is evolving, and it is possible that new laws and regulations will be adopted in the United States and internationally, or existing laws and regulations may be interpreted in new ways, that would affect the operation of our marketplace and the way in which we interact with borrowers and investors. The cost to comply with such laws or regulations could be significant and would increase our operating expenses, and we may be unable to pass those costs on to our borrowers and investors in the form of increased fees. In addition, federal and state governmental or regulatory agencies may decide to impose taxes on services provided over the Internet or by online marketplaces. These taxes could discourage the use of our marketplace, which would adversely affect the viability of our business.\nInvestors in the limited partnership interests offered by LCA or certificates offered by the Trust may be deemed to have been solicited by general solicitation or general advertising, and such investors could seek to rescind their purchase.\nWe offer notes through a public offering. In addition, the Trust invest in loans through our marketplace. The Trust and LCA offer certificates and limited partnership interests, respectively, to raise capital for their investments. The offerings by the Trust and LCA are made privately with potential investors with whom they have, or have established through a review and diligence process and cooling-off period which, in our opinion, constitutes a substantive, pre-existing relationship outside of the public offering for the notes prior to an investment in the certificates or limited partnership interests and separate from the public offering of the notes. Because of\nthe fact-specific nature of what constitutes a substantive, pre-existing relationship and the means by which it is created, as well as what types of activities might constitute a general solicitation or general advertising with regard to the private offerings of the certificates and limited partnership interests, it is possible that some of these investors could assert that they became interested in an investment in these private offerings by LCA or the Trust through a general solicitation or general advertising with regard to those offerings or the public offering of notes. If it was determined that an investor\u2019s interest in the certificates or limited partnership interests was the result of a general solicitation or general advertisement, all investors could claim that the sale of certificates or limited partnership interests violated Section 5 of the Securities Act and could seek to rescind their purchase or seek other remedies, subject to any applicable statute of limitations. We would contest vigorously any claim that a violation of the Securities Act occurred, however, litigation is inherently uncertain and can be expensive and time consuming.\nRISKS RELATED TO OWNERSHIP OF OUR COMMON STOCK\nThe market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control. In addition to the factors discussed in Item 1A - Risk Factors and elsewhere in the Report, factors that could cause fluctuations in the market price of our common stock include the following:\n\u2022\noverall performance of the equity markets;\n\u2022\nour operating performance and the performance of other similar companies;\n\u2022\nchanges in the estimates of our operating results that we provide to the public, our failure to meet these projections or changes in recommendations by securities analysts that elect to follow our common stock;\n\u2022\nregulatory developments;\n\u2022\nannouncements of innovations, new loan products or acquisitions, strategic alliances or significant agreements by our competitors;\n\u2022\ndisruptions in our platform due to computer hardware, software or network problems;\n\u2022\nrecruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u2022\nthe economy as a whole or market conditions in our industry;\n\u2022\ntrading activity by stockholders who beneficially own large amounts of our outstanding common stock;\n\u2022\nthe expiration of market standoff or contractual lock-up agreements; and\n\u2022\nthe size of our market float.\nIn the past, stockholders have filed securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. If we were to become involved in securities litigation, it could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business and adversely affect our business.\nSubstantial blocks of our total outstanding shares may be sold into the market when \u201clock-up\u201d or \u201cmarket standoff\u201d periods end. If there are substantial sales of shares of our common stock, the price of our common stock could decline.\nThe price of our common stock could decline if there are substantial sales of our common stock, particularly sales by our directors, executive officers and significant stockholders, or if there is a large number of shares of our common stock available for sale. In connection with our initial public offering, all of our security holders entered into market standoff agreements with us restricting the sale of any shares of our common stock or entered into lock-up agreements with the underwriters under which they have agreed, subject to certain exceptions, not to sell any shares of our common stock until June 10, 2015. Beginning on that date, subject to extension under certain circumstances, approximately 303 million shares of our common stock will become eligible for sale in the public market pursuant to Rule 144 or as a registered security, of which approximately 193 million shares will be held by affiliates and subject to the volume and other restrictions of Rule 144.\nShares held by directors, executive officers and other affiliates are subject to volume limitations under Rule 144 under the Securities Act. Our underwriter, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC may, in its discretion, permit our stockholders to sell shares prior to the expiration of the restrictive provisions contained in these lock-up agreements.\nCertain of our stockholders have rights, subject to some conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering their shares that we may file for ourselves or our stockholders. All of these shares are subject to market standoff or lock-up agreements restricting their sale until June 10, 2015. In addition, shares issued or issuable upon exercise of options or warrants vested as of the expiration of the lock-up agreements will be eligible for sale at that time.\nThe price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of common stock in the public market at the termination of market standoff or lock-up agreements, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell their shares.\nWe may invest or spend the net proceeds to us from our initial public offering in ways with which you may not agree or in ways which may not yield a return or increase the price of our common stock.\nWe intend to use the net proceeds to us from our initial public offering for general corporate purposes, including working capital, operating expenses and capital expenditures. We have used a portion of the net proceeds to us to repay indebtedness outstanding under our term loan. Additionally, we may use a portion of the net proceeds to us to acquire businesses, products, services or assets. We do not, however, have agreements or commitments for any acquisitions at this time. Our management will have discretion in the application of the net proceeds to us from our initial public offering. Until the net proceeds to us are used, they may be placed in investments that do not yield a favorable return.\nOur directors, executive officers and principal stockholders have substantial control over us and could delay or prevent a change in corporate control.\nAs of December 31, 2014, our directors, executive officers and holders of more than 5% of our common stock, together with their affiliates, beneficially own, in the aggregate, 52.9% of our outstanding common stock. These stockholders, acting together, have the ability to control the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors and any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. In addition, these stockholders, acting together, have the ability to control the management and affairs of our company.\nWe may require additional capital to support business growth, and this capital might not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.\nWe intend to continue to make investments to support our business growth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges, including the need to develop new loan products or enhance our marketplace, improve our operating infrastructure or acquire complementary businesses and technologies. Accordingly, we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. If we raise additional funds through future issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of our common stock. Any debt financing we secure in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be impaired and our business may be harmed.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid cash or other dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not expect to declare or pay any dividends for the foreseeable future.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law may delay or prevent an acquisition of our company.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws, contain provisions that may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us or changes in our management. The provisions, among other things:\n\u2022\nestablish a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board of directors are elected at one time;\n\u2022\npermit only our board of directors to establish the number of directors and fill vacancies on the board;\n\u2022\nprovide that directors may only be removed \u201cfor cause\u201d and only with the approval of two-thirds of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nrequire two-thirds vote to amend some provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws;\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that our board of directors could use to implement a stockholder rights plan (also known as a \u201cpoison pill\u201d);\n\u2022\neliminate the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent, which will require that all stockholder actions must be taken at a stockholder meeting;\n\u2022\ndo not provide for cumulative voting; and\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings.\nThese provisions, alone or together, could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management.\nIn addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which limits the ability of stockholders owning in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock to merge or combine with us in certain circumstances.\nAny provision of our restated certificate of incorporation or restated bylaws, as we expect they will be in effect upon the completion of this offering, or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts publish negative reports about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline, or if they change their recommendations regarding our stock adversely, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends, to some extent, on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who may in the future cover us downgrade our shares or change their opinion of our shares, our share price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our share price or trading volume to decline.\nIf we were to become subject to a bankruptcy or similar proceeding, the right of payment of investors in our notes may be senior to the right of payment of our stockholders and there may not be value recoverable by our stockholders.\nUnder the terms of the notes offered through our marketplace, we are obligated to pay principal and interest on each note on a non-recourse basis only if and to the extent that we receive principal, interest or late fee payments from the borrower on the corresponding loan, but the notes become fully recourse to us if we fail to pay such obligation, which would include being prohibited from making such payments as a result of a bankruptcy or similar proceeding, or if we breach a covenant under the indenture governing the notes. In a bankruptcy or similar proceeding due to a default under current or future indebtedness, an action for repurchase or rescission of securities or other event, there is uncertainty regarding whether a holder of a note has any right of payment from our assets other than the corresponding loan. It is possible that a note holder could be deemed to have a right of payment from both the corresponding loan and from some or all of our other assets, in which case the note holder would have a claim to the proceeds of our assets that is senior to any right of payment of the holders of our common stock, regardless of whether we have received any payments from the underlying borrower, making it highly unlikely that there would be any value recoverable by our stockholders.", "PERMNO": 15092, "SIC": 6141, "TIC": "LC"}
