RISK FACTORS\nSet forth below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in other documents we file with the SEC are descriptions of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe cannot predict the timing of the completion of the Dissolution or the timing, amount or nature of any future distributions to our stockholders.\nUnder the DGCL, the Dissolution period and the Company\u2019s corporate existence will continue until at least March 7, 2016, three years from the date we filed the Certificate of Dissolution, or such longer period as the Court of Chancery directs to, among other things, enable the Company to dispose and convey its properties, discharge its liabilities and distribute to its stockholders any remaining assets. Subject to uncertainties inherent in the winding-down of our business, we expect to make one or more liquidating distributions during the Dissolution period. No assurances can be made as to the ultimate amounts to be distributed, if any, or the timing of any liquidating distributions, the amount of which is subject to our covering wind-down costs, charges, expenses and liabilities, as well as our ability to dispose of the Company\u2019s remaining non-cash assets within the three-year period.\nThe completion of the Dissolution and any final liquidating distributions could also be delayed or diminished due to other factors, including, without limitation:\n\u2022\nthe closing of the sale of the Tyngsborough Land and the resolution of the Tyngsborough Litigation, if the sale of the Tyngsborough Land to Tyngsborough Commons does not occur by December 31, 2015;\n\u2022\nif we are unable to liquidate our remaining non-cash assets, including the Tyngsborough Land and our investment in Tejas, or such liquidation takes longer than expected;\n\u2022\nif we are unable to resolve the pending investigation by the U.S. Department of Labor of our 401(k) plan, or such resolution takes longer than expected;\n\u2022\nif we become a party to any additional lawsuits or other claims asserted by or against us, including any claims or litigation arising in connection with our decision to continue to pursue the Dissolution;\n\u2022\nif we are unable to resolve any pending or new claims or investigations with creditors or third parties, or if such resolutions take longer than expected; or\n\u2022\nif we are unable to reduce our public company reporting requirements under the Exchange Act during the Dissolution period.\nAny of the foregoing could delay the completion of the Dissolution, or could delay the distribution of or substantially diminish, or eliminate, the amount available for future distribution to our stockholders. In addition, under the DGCL, certain claims and demands may be asserted against us at any time during the three year wind-down period. Accordingly, we expect to continue to maintain insurance coverage and may set aside a reasonable amount of cash or other assets as a contingency reserve to satisfy claims against and obligations of the Company that may arise during the remainder of the wind-down period. As a result of these factors, we may retain for distribution at a later date some or all of the estimated amounts that we expect to distribute to our stockholders as part of the liquidation process.\nCertain parties have in the past and more recently presented to the Company certain proposals regarding potential alternatives to the completion of the Dissolution. No assurances can be given as to the effect or outcome of, or the Company\u2019s response to, any such proposal.\nThe amount available for future distribution to our stockholders could be reduced or eliminated if our expectations regarding our wind-down costs are inaccurate.\nClaims, liabilities and expenses from operations (such as administrative costs, salaries, directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance, federal and state income taxes, business and local taxes, legal and accounting fees and miscellaneous\noffice expenses) will continue to be incurred as we seek to wind-down our business and will increase if the Dissolution period is extended beyond March 7, 2016 or if the Company establishes a liquidating trust to liquidate and distribute the remaining assets. Our expectations regarding our expenses may be inaccurate. Any unexpected claims, liabilities or expenses, or any claims, liabilities or expenses that exceed our current estimates, could reduce or eliminate the amount of cash available for ultimate distribution to our stockholders. Any such payments will reduce the assets available for distribution to our stockholders. If available cash and amounts received in sales of our remaining non-cash assets together with any cash on hand are not adequate to provide for our obligations, liabilities, expenses and claims, we may not be able to make any further liquidating distributions to our stockholders.\nWe may experience difficulties identifying, analyzing or consummating alternatives with respect to our remaining non-cash assets and any such alternatives may not achieve desired results.\nThe Company\u2019s non-cash assets primarily consist of the Tyngsborough Land and our investment in Tejas. While we continue to pursue the sale or monetization of these assets in accordance with the Plan of Dissolution and have entered into the Purchase Agreement for the sale of the Tyngsborough Land, we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to successfully sell these assets or identify suitable third parties for any such transactions. The closing of the sale of the Tyngsborough Land is subject to certain conditions and obligations of the parties to the Purchase Agreement prior to closing, some of which are outside of the Company\u2019s control and, accordingly, there can be no assurance as to when or if such closing will occur. If the Purchase Agreement is terminated, there can be no assurance as to when, if ever, the Company will be able to sell the Tyngsborough Land. The inability to sell the Tyngsborough Land may delay the completion of the Company\u2019s liquidation and related distributions to our stockholders. Even if we identify suitable third parties for transactions to sell our remaining non-cash assets, we may not be able to successfully negotiate or consummate a transaction on attractive terms and conditions for such sales, including attractive pricing. There can be no assurance as to the amount of consideration the Company may be able to obtain for these assets or as to any time frame within which a potential sale or other disposition of these assets might occur. Furthermore, our pursuit of any such transaction may result in our incurring substantial legal and other fees, whether or not a transaction with respect to any particular asset is ultimately consummated. There are also certain actual and potential costs associated with the continued retention of these assets, such as property taxes owed and the potential Betterment Assessment in the case of the Tyngsborough Land. Any decision we make regarding our options will necessarily involve risks and uncertainties and present challenges in implementation. As a result, pursuit of any such options may not lead to increased stockholder value and, whether or not we pursue any available options, the amounts available for future distribution to the Company\u2019s stockholders may decrease during the wind-down period or be eliminated entirely.\nOur stockholders may be liable to our creditors for part or all of the amount received from us in our liquidating distributions if reserves are inadequate.\nOn July 2, 2014, the Delaware Court of Chancery granted the Company\u2019s petition for a determination, among other things, that approximately $6.2 million is sufficient to be retained by the Company for anticipated wind-down costs and expenses and an additional $6.5 million is sufficient to be retained by the Company for contingent and unknown liabilities, including any additional claims and obligations that may arise. However, this amount may not be adequate to cover all of our claims and obligations prior to the completion of the Dissolution. Under the DGCL, each stockholder could be held liable for claims against the Company, solely in respect of claims brought during the three year period after the filing of the Certificate of Dissolution, in an amount not to exceed the lesser of (i) such stockholder\u2019s pro rata share of amounts owed to creditors in excess of the contingency reserve and (ii) the amounts previously received by such stockholder in the Dissolution from us and from any liquidating trust or trusts. Accordingly, in such event, a stockholder could be required to return part or all of the liquidating distributions previously made to such stockholder, and a stockholder could receive nothing from us under the Plan of Dissolution. In addition, although the Board determined that all amounts distributed to our stockholders prior to the filing of the Certificate of Dissolution were appropriately paid out of surplus as defined under the DGCL and otherwise not required to satisfy liabilities to our creditors, to the extent that the\ncontingency reserve is determined to be inadequate for payment of our claims and obligations, and it is further determined that the Board\u2019s determination was incorrect at the time of the declaration of such distributions, it is possible that creditors could seek to recoup such amounts from our stockholders. Moreover, if a stockholder has paid taxes on amounts previously received, a repayment of all or a portion of such amount could result in a situation in which a stockholder may incur a net tax cost if the repayment of the amount previously distributed does not cause a commensurate reduction in taxes payable in an amount equal to the amount of the taxes paid on amounts previously distributed.\nWe closed our stock transfer books on March 7, 2013 and trading of the Common Stock was suspended on the NASDAQ Global Select Market as of March 7, 2013, each of which may make it difficult for stockholders to trade their shares.\nOn March 7, 2013 (the \u201cFinal Record Date\u201d), we closed our stock transfer books and discontinued recording transfers of shares of the Common Stock on our stock transfer books, except transfers by will, intestate succession or operation of law. Therefore, shares of the Common Stock ceased being freely transferable after the Final Record Date. All liquidating distributions from us or a liquidating trust, if any, will be made to our stockholders pro rata according to their respective holdings of Common Stock as of the Final Record Date. Following the filing of our Certificate of Dissolution, trading of the Common Stock on The NASDAQ Global Select Market was suspended effective as of the close of trading on March 7, 2013 and, on March 15, 2013, we filed a Form 25 with the SEC to delist our Common Stock, which became effective prior to the opening of trading on March 25, 2013.\nFollowing the suspension of trading of the Common Stock, shares of our Common Stock held in street name with brokers have been trading in the over-the-counter market on the Pink Sheets, an electronic bulletin board established for unlisted securities, under the symbol \u201cSCMR.PK\u201d. The Company has been informed that the Common Stock has been trading under \u201cdue-bill\u201d contractual obligations between the seller and purchaser of the stock, who negotiate and rely on themselves with respect to the allocation of stockholder proceeds arising from ownership of the shares. As a result, investors may find it more difficult to dispose of, or obtain accurate quotations for the price of, the Common Stock, if they are able to trade the Common Stock at all. Liquidity in the Company\u2019s shares may be further reduced if and when the Company announces the sale of one or more of its remaining non-cash assets, the resolution of any outstanding claims or disputes, or further liquidating distributions.\nThe market price of the Common Stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, subject to price volatility.\nTrading in the Common Stock is inherently risky and highly speculative and may be informed by the perceived value of any further distributions as part of the liquidation process. Because of the difficulty in estimating the amount and timing of the liquidating distributions, and due to the other risk factors discussed herein, the Common Stock may be subject to significant volatility and may trade above or below the amount of any liquidating distribution(s) that may be made.\nWe may seek to reduce our public company reporting requirements, which could substantially reduce publicly available information about the Company.\nWe remain subject to the applicable reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. Compliance with such reporting requirements is economically burdensome, and we are evaluating available options to reduce these expenses, including seeking any relief that may be available from the reporting requirements under the Exchange Act; however, no assurances can be given as to whether we will be able to reduce these expenses or as to the timing of any such reduction. Until such time as we are able to reduce or eliminate our reporting requirements under the Exchange Act, we will continue to incur significant costs in complying with our reporting obligations. If we reduce our reporting obligations, we anticipate that we would continue to file Current Reports on Form 8-K to disclose material events relating to the Dissolution, along with certain other reports that the SEC might\nrequire. However, we would not expect to continue to file Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or Annual Reports on Form 10-K, which could reduce substantially the amount of public information regarding the Company available to our stockholders.\nIf we are unable to retain key personnel and consultants, our ability to successfully complete the wind-down may be harmed.\nOur ability to successfully implement the Plan of Dissolution is partially dependent upon our ability to retain our remaining personnel and consultants. As of July 31, 2015, we had one remaining employee and continued to retain certain former employees in a consulting capacity to assist with the wind-down. The retention of qualified personnel and consultants is difficult under present circumstances, and while we have offered these individuals certain financial incentives to remain with the Company, there is no legal obligation that would require those individuals to do so. Failure to retain these persons could harm the implementation of the Plan of Dissolution. In the event we are unable to retain key personnel and consultants, we may be required to engage other consultants to perform their duties or hire employees at a premium salary to perform certain key functions and day-to-day tasks.\nWe may undergo, or may already have undergone, an \u201cownership change\u201d within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which could affect our ability to offset gains, if any, realized from the sale of the Company\u2019s assets against our net operating losses and certain of our tax credit carryovers, which could reduce the amount available for distribution to our stockholders.\nSection 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d) contains rules that limit the ability of a company that undergoes an ownership change to utilize its net operating losses and tax credits existing as of the date of such ownership change. Under the rules, such an ownership change is generally any change in ownership of more than 50% of a company\u2019s stock within a rolling three-year period. The rules generally operate by focusing on changes in ownership among stockholders considered by the rules as owning, directly or indirectly, 5% or more of the stock of a company (\u201c5% Shareholders\u201d) and any change in ownership arising from new issuances of stock by the company.\nRecent SEC filings by investors suggest that there may have been significant trading in the Company\u2019s stock by 5% Shareholders. Consequently, the current ownership change percentage in the Company\u2019s stock for purposes of Section 382 of the Code is uncertain, and it is possible that Company may have undergone, or may soon undergo, one or more ownership changes for purposes of Section 382 of the Code.\nIf we were to undergo one or more \u201cownership changes\u201d within the meaning of Section 382 of the Code, or if one has already occurred, our net operating losses and certain of our tax credits existing as of the date of each ownership change may be unavailable, in whole or in part, to offset gains, if any, from the sale of the Company\u2019s assets. If we are unable to offset fully for U.S. federal income tax purposes gains, if any, realized in respect of the sale of assets with its tax loss carry-forwards, we may incur U.S. federal income tax liability that could reduce the assets available for distribution to our stockholders.", "PERMNO": 87343, "SIC": 9995, "TIC": "SCMR"}
